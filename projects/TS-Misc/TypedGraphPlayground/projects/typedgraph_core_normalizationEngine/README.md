# Normalization Engine

A recreation of my old project that implements Type Normalization via Generic Contract Processing. 
I originally implemented this in C# in 2008. I want to use it to explore the TypeScript Generics and Type Inference capabilities.

Also, it was super powerful. It enabled a full verticle integration (across the wire) of a given stack. You never 
had to deal with properties or fields from that point on. All foundational functionality, once expressed in a
normalized form, was available across the stack. 

A Reference to the original project is available on my GitHub.

<h1><a class="anchor" name="build">Building From Source </a></h1>The C runtime is provided in source code form only as there are too many binary versions to sensibly maintain binaries on www.antlr.org.<p>
The runtime code is provided with .sln and .vcproj files for Visual Studio 2005 and 2008, and <b>configure</b> files for building and installation on UNIX or other systems that support this tool. If your system is neither Windows nor <b>configure</b> compatible, then you should find it reasonable to build the code manually (see section "Building Manually".)<h2><a class="anchor" name="src">
Source Code Organization</a></h2>
The source code expands from a tar/zip file to give you the following directories:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>./</b> The location of the configure script and the antlr3config.h file generated by the running the configure script.This directory also contains the solution and project files for visual studio 2005 and 2008.</li><li><b>./src</b> The location of all the C files in the project.</li><li><b>./include</b> The location of all the header files for the project</li><li><b>./doxygen</b> The location of documentation files such as the one that generates this page</li><li>Other ancillary directories used by the build or documentation process.</li></ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="winbuild">
Building for Windows</a></h2>
If you are building for Cygwin, or a similar UNIX on Windows System, follow the "Building With Configure" instructions below.<p>
Note that the runtime is no longer compatible with the VC6 Microsoft compiler. If you absolutely need to build with this compiler, you can probably hack the source code to deall with the pieces that VC6 cannot handle such as the ULL suffix for constants.<p>
If you wish to build the binaries for Windows using Visual Studio 2005, or 2008 you may build using the IDE:<ol type=1>
<li>Open the C.sln file</li><li>Select batch Build from the Build menu</li><li>Select all configurations and press the build button.</li></ol>
<p>
If you wish or need to build the libraries from the command line, then you must use a Windows command shell configured for access to VS2005/VS2008 compilers, such as the one that is started from:<p>
<em>Start-&gt;Microsoft Visual Studio 2005-&gt;Visual Studio Tools-&gt;Visual Studio 2005 Command Prompt</em><p>
There appears to be no way to build all targets at once in a batch mode from the command line, so you may build one or all of the following: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
   C:\antlrsrc\code\antlr\main\runtime\C&gt; DEVENV C.sln /Build ReleaseDLL
   C:\antlrsrc\code\antlr\main\runtime\C&gt; DEVENV C.sln /Build Release
   C:\antlrsrc\code\antlr\main\runtime\C&gt; DEVENV C.sln /Build DebugDLL
   C:\antlrsrc\code\antlr\main\runtime\C&gt; DEVENV C.sln /Build Debug
</pre></div><p>
After the build is complete you will find the <code></code>. and <code></code>. files under the directory containing C.sln, in a subdirectory named after the /Build target. In the Release and Debug targets, you will find that there is only a <code></code>. archive file, which you can link directly into your own projects if you wish to avoid the DLL. In <code>ReleaseDLL</code> and <code>DebugDLL</code> you will find both a <code></code>.LIB file which you should link your projects with and a DLL. The library and names on Windows are as follows:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  - ReleaseDLL  :   ANTLR3C.DLL and ANTLR3C_DLL.LIB
  - DebugDLL    :  ANTLR3CD.DLL and ANTLR3CD_DLL.LIB
  - Release     :   ANTLR3C.LIB
  - Debug       :  ANTLR3CD.LIB
</pre></div><p>
There currently no .msi modules or other installs built for Windows, so you must place the DLLs in a directory referenced by the PATH environment variable and make the include directory available to your project configurations.<h2><a class="anchor" name="configure">
Building with configure</a></h2>
Before starting, make sure that you are using a source code distribution and not the source code directly from the Perforce repository. If you use the source from the perforce tree directly, you will find that there is no configure script as this is generated as part of the distribution build by the maintainers. If you feel the need to build from the distribution tree then you must have all the autobuild packages available on your system and can generate the configure script using autoreconf. If you are not familiar with these tools, then please use the tgz files in the dist subdirectory (or downloaded from the ANTLR web site).<p>
The source code file should be expanded in a directory of your choice (probably your working directory) using the command:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
gzip -dc antlrtgzname.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</pre></div><p>
Where: <b>antlrtgzname.tar.gz</b> is of course the name of the tar when you downloaded it. You should find a <b>configure</b> script in the sub directory thus created.<p>
The configure script accepts the usual options, such as --prefix= but the default is to build in the source directory and to place libraries in <b>/usr/local/lib</b> and include files (for building your recognizers) in <b>/usr/local/include</b>. There are also a number of antlr specific options, which you may wish to utilize. The command: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
./configure --help
</pre></div><p>
Will document the latest incarnations of these options in case this documentation is ever out of date. At this time the options are:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  --enable-debuginfo   Compiles debug info into the library (default no)
  --enable-64bit       Turns on flags that produce 64 bit object code if
                       any are required (default no)
</pre></div><p>
Unless you need 64 bit builds, or a change in library types, you will generally use the configure command without options:<p>
Here is a sample configure output:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">

You are now ready to generate C recognizers and compile and link them with the ANTLR 3 C Runtime.<h2><a class="anchor" name="buildman">
Building Manually</a></h2>
The only step that configure performs that cannot be done manually (without effort) is to produce the header file <code>antlr3config.h</code>, which contains typedefs of the fundamental types that your local C compiler supports. The easiest way to produce this file for your system, if you cannot port <b>automake</b> and <b>configure</b> to the system is:<p>
<ol type=1>
<li>Run configure on a system that does support configure</li><li>Copy the generated <code>antlr3config.h</code> file to the target system</li><li>Edit the file locally and change any types that differ on this system to the target systems. There are only a few types and you should find this relatively easy.</li></ol>
<p>
Having produced a compatible antlr3config.h file, then you should be able to compile the source files in the <code></code>./src subdirectory, providing an include path to the location of <code>antlr3config.h</code> and the <code></code>./include subdirectory. Something akin to: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">

~/C/src: cc -c -O -I.. -I../include *.c

</pre></div><p>
Having produced the .o (or equivalent) files for the local system you can then build an archive or shared library for the C runtime.<p>
When you wish to build and link with the C runtime, specify the path to the supplied header files, and the path to the library that you built. </div>

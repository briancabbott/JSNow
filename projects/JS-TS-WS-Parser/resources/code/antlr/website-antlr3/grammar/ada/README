The Ada tree structure (ada.g) and superclass (ada.tree.g) have
been tested somewhat due to work on a first real application,
Ada support in kdevelop (http://www.kdevelop.org)

suggestions on the tree structure are still
--

You can see the generated tree as follows:
Define an environment variable, ANTLR_TREE.
Then run the parser program, and redirect the output to a file.

Example in Bourne shell:

$ export ANTLR_TREE=1
$ ada my_ada_program.adb > adatree.tmp

This temporary output file will not be nicely readable because
everything is on a single line. You can get readable output using
the choptree script:

$ choptree adatree.tmp

If you want to additionally run the generated tree through the
AdaTreeParserSuper, then define the symbol ANTLR_TREE_WALK:

$ export ANTLR_TREE_WALK=1

This verifies that the tree produced by the AdaParser matches the
tree expected by the AdaTreeParserSuper.

<h1>GraphViz Dot grammar</h1>
<p>
This ANTLR grammar will allow you to parse <tt>.dot</tt> files using ANTLR.
</p>
<p>
<div style="{display: inline;}">
Currently, the parser builds a tree whose root node
is a <div class="literal">graph</div> or <div class="literal">digraph</div>,
depending on whether the document defines a directed graph or not.<br />
The first child is just a text with the name of the graph, and his siblings
are, either <div class="reserved">nodes</div> or
<div class="reserved">edges</div>, in the order in which they appear in the
document.<br />
Each <div class="reserved">node</div> contains a set of children whose
names are the name of the <div class="reserved">node</div>'s attributes, and
themselves containing just a text node with the value of each one of the
attributes.<br />
On the other hand, a <div class="reserved">edge</div> is labeled with the
<i>origin</i> of the relationship, and would be a tree node composed of
<ul>
  <li><div class="literal">&minus;&minus;</div> or
    <div class="literal">&minus;&gt;</div>,
    depending on whether the document defines a directed graph or not, and</li>
  <li>the name of the <div class="reserved">node</div> which appears as
    the <i>target</i> of the relationship.</li>
</ul>
</div>

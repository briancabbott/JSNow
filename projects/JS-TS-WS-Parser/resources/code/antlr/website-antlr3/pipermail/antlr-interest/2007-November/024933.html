<PRE>Howdy,

A while ago I posted a cry for help because I was using StringTemplate 
to generate some java code and I would sometimes get this error:

CharScanner; panic: ClassNotFoundException: 
org.antlr.stringtemplate.language.ChunkToken

The problem relates to class loading. Here's a nice primer on the 
subject: <A HREF="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2005/01/26/classloading.html">http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2005/01/26/classloading.html</A>

The situation is this:

- I am using Antlr3
- I am using StringTemplate 3.1b1
- I am using Ant
- I have adapted my program to run both stand-alone and as an Ant task.

When I ran the program from the Linux command line, there was no 
problem. But when I ran the program from within Ant, I got the 
CharScanner panic.

What I have learned is that an Ant task can by dynamically loaded, which 
I am doing. That looks like this:

    &lt;taskdef
        classpathRef = &quot;antlr3.class.path&quot;
        loaderRef = &quot;antlr3&quot;
        name = &quot;antlr3&quot;
        /&gt;

When you do this, Ant creates a new instance of &quot;AntClassLoader&quot; with 
the loaderRef you specify (a unique meaningless name) and with the 
classpath you provide. (In this example, the classpath is very, very 
specific.)

On the other hand, you can include jar files in your ant installation by 
placing them either in your /usr/share/ant/lib directory, or in your 
$HOME/.ant/lib directory. Putting the files in these pre-defined 
locations means that Ant can load them using the classloader that Ant 
uses to pick up libraries - an instance of java.net.URLClassLoader.

I put this code in my ant task:

private void printLoaderChain(ClassLoader cl, String msg)
{
    if (msg != null) System.err.println(msg);
    System.err.println(&quot;Classloader chain starts with:&quot;);
    while (cl != null)
    {
        System.err.println(cl);
        cl = cl.getParent();
    }
    System.err.println(&quot;--- chain ends&quot;);
}
public final void execute()
{
    System.err.println(&quot;Classloader data:&quot;);
    printLoaderChain(this.getClass().getClassLoader(), &quot;Here is the 
current chain&quot;);
    printLoaderChain(antlr.CharScanner.class.getClassLoader(), &quot;Here is 
the CharScanner chain&quot;);


And ran Ant with two different invocations. The first invocation, which 
cause the problem, was a mixed model. Some ant tasks were loaded with 
dynamic loading, while other tasks were in the ~/.ant/lib directory. The 
results look like this:

   [gunit3] Classloader data:
   [gunit3] Here is the current chain
   [gunit3] Classloader chain starts with:
** [gunit3] AntClassLoader[/home/austin/gunit/release/gunit-1.1.jar]   
   [gunit3] sun.misc.Launcher$<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">AppClassLoader at 7d772e</A>
   [gunit3] sun.misc.Launcher$<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">ExtClassLoader at 11b86e7</A>
   [gunit3] --- chain ends
   [gunit3] Here is the CharScanner chain
   [gunit3] Classloader chain starts with:
** [gunit3] <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">java.net.URLClassLoader at 61de33</A>              
   [gunit3] sun.misc.Launcher$<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">AppClassLoader at 7d772e</A>
   [gunit3] sun.misc.Launcher$<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">ExtClassLoader at 11b86e7</A>
   [gunit3] --- chain ends
   [gunit3] File: /home/austin/gunit/tests/org/antlr/gunit/CodeBlocks.ts
   [gunit3] Generating: CodeBlocks
   [gunit3] CharScanner; panic: ClassNotFoundException: 
org.antlr.stringtemplate.language.ChunkToken

Notice that the &quot;current&quot; chain and the &quot;CharScanner&quot; chain start with 
different nodes (AntClassLoader vs. URLClassLoader).

When I removed ~/.ant/lib/checkstyle-all-4.3.jar from my ~/.ant/lib 
directory, I got different output:

   [gunit3] Classloader data:
   [gunit3] Here is the current chain
   [gunit3] Classloader chain starts with:
   [gunit3] AntClassLoader[/home/austin/gunit/release/gunit-1.1.jar]
   [gunit3] sun.misc.Launcher$<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">AppClassLoader at 7d772e</A>
   [gunit3] sun.misc.Launcher$<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">ExtClassLoader at 11b86e7</A>
   [gunit3] --- chain ends
   [gunit3] Here is the CharScanner chain
   [gunit3] Classloader chain starts with:
   [gunit3] AntClassLoader[/home/austin/gunit/release/gunit-1.1.jar]
   [gunit3] sun.misc.Launcher$<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">AppClassLoader at 7d772e</A>
   [gunit3] sun.misc.Launcher$<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">ExtClassLoader at 11b86e7</A>
   [gunit3] --- chain ends
   [gunit3] File: /home/austin/gunit/tests/org/antlr/gunit/CodeBlocks.ts
   [gunit3] Generating: CodeBlocks
   [gunit3] Writing junit test class to: ./CodeBlocks_Test.java
   [gunit3] File: /home/austin/gunit/tests/org/antlr/gunit/Gunit.ts
   [gunit3] Generating: Gunit
   [gunit3] Writing junit test class to: ./Gunit_Test.java


In this case, the CharScanner class has the same classloader chain that 
the current (AntTask) class has.

The problem is NOT caused by having different class loader chains. The 
problem is caused by 'poisoning' class loader chains. The StringTemplate 
library uses antlr2, and configures it to use a new token type 
(org.stringtemplate.language.ChunkToken). Find and reread this section 
of the article:

&quot;In other words, the JVM cannot execute the code:

|<i>    Target target3 = (Target) target2;
</I>|<i>
</I>

The above code will throw a |ClassCastException|. This is because the 
JVM sees these two as separate, distinct class types, since they are 
defined by different |ClassLoader| instances.&quot;

When the checkstyle task is in my ~/.ant/lib path, it gets loaded by 
ant. And checkstyle uses antlr. Hooray for antlr! But when my 
stringtemplate code, which also uses antlr, tried to load the antlr 
classes, there was no need - the classloader chain already had the antlr 
classes loaded - BY A DIFFERENT LOADER. That's not a problem - you can 
still use the classes. But when the antlr lexer tried to instantiate a 
stringtemplate class, it could not find the class because the 
stringtemplate library was loaded by a child of the antlr ClassLoader. 
That is:

1: System loaders
2: Ant loader with ~/.ant/lib/checkstyle classes, including ANTLR
3: Dynamic loader with StringTemplate classes, but not ANTLR.

My code was loaded by #3, and went looking for the antlr classes. The #3 
class loader delegated first to its parent loader, #2, which had loaded 
them already.

My code (StringTemplate) passed a class name to antlr. Antlr tried to 
instantiate the named class, and so called its class loader (#2) which 
can only search in #2 and #1. Doh! ClassNotFoundException.

The solution in the near term is to get antlr out of the loader chain. I 
accomplished this by removing checkstyle from my ant library directory, 
and using dynamic loading to load it with a new AntClassLoader. This 
&quot;cleans up&quot; the loader chain, so that my task only finds classes in its 
own loader.

The longer-term solution is to clean up antlr. Obviously there's an 
antlr-2 versus antlr-3 thing here, and so this will have to happen in 
antlr-3. But passing class names is a no-no -- pass class objects 
instead. Giving a class object would allow the class' own loader (my 
loader, #3, in this case) to be called for the instantiation. There are 
probably some other rules out there for doing this stuff. The ant guys 
may be a good resource, since they do this dynamic loading all the time. 
Or maybe eclipse has a document about it.

Facing the same problem at the same time (see my post: &quot;literal and
string distinction&quot;, I got an idea:
Wouldn't it make sense (if possible?) to switch between different lexers
with one dealing with keywords and the other not?
Is switching of lexers possible/supported or does lookahead render this
impossible?

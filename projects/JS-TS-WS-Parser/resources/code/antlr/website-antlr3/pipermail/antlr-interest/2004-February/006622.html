&gt;<i> Short version:

</I>
Yes, a single list is what I'm shooting for.  I'll even probably put 
something at the jguru forum that redirects to antlr.org's version 
when/if it appears.

&gt;<i> Long version:

</I>
There will always be an email gateway.  What don't you like about 
forums?  Now's the time to figure out what we want :)

&gt;<i> Usually when people implement Jive they end up with a bunch of forums. 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't
</I>&gt;<i> see the value in that for ANTLR-INTEREST; I am not interested in every 
</I>&gt;<i> single
</I>&gt;<i> message that comes through currently, but I doubt you can divide up

</I>&gt;<i> into forums that will allow me to say &quot;I am interested in forums A, B, 
</I>&gt;<i> and D but
</I>&gt;<i> I'll never care about anything in forums C and E.&quot; So, please make it 
</I>&gt;<i> convenient
</I>&gt;<i> to receive _all_ the ANTLR messages by email.
</I>
Oh, I get it.  yes, I imagine only one list/forum.

&gt;<i> IMO, the worst thing about Yahoo Groups is the search feature; it is 
</I>&gt;<i> frustrating
</I>&gt;<i> to use (especially, its paging is completely useless and its threading 
</I>&gt;<i> is bad).
</I>&gt;<i> If the search interface didn't suck too badly I wouldn't care about 
</I>&gt;<i> the ads. But
</I>&gt;<i> is Jive's search better than Yahoo Groups'?
</I>
I hope so; haven't investigated yet. Anybody else?

&gt;<i> Blogs: Usually, there is a one-to-one relationship between a blog and 
</I>&gt;<i> a person.
</I>
Yep.

&gt;<i> I doubt many people (even you, Terence) are going to have a blog that 
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> completely about ANTLR.
</I>
Actually, I have been offered blogs on multiple sites but I just don't 
seem to want to tell people what I had for lunch or about the stupid 
person at the restaurant that annoyed me.  You'll note that my &quot;blogs&quot; 
at antlr.org are now text files where I dump my ideas for ANTLR 3 so I 
can organize my thoughts.  I generate copious notes...might as well 
post.

I can't imagine a blog for anything but ANTLR 3.

&gt;<i>  Why would you want antlr.org to host blogs that aren't
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR-specific? There are so many blogging hosts out there right now, 
</I>&gt;<i> what is
</I>&gt;<i> the advantage to our &quot;ANTLR community&quot; to adding another one at 
</I>&gt;<i> antlr.org?
</I>
None.  I don't plan on allowing any blogs other than mine.  Perhaps if 
Monty wants one for somethign purely antlr related.

&gt;<i> Personally, I'd rather see a read-only ANTLR 3 source code repository 
</I>&gt;<i> (perforce,
</I>&gt;<i> subversion, or cvs).
</I>
You shall have it, sir!  The thing is though that I'll not release it 
publicly until it's semi mature.  It's in my &quot;playground&quot; now and not 
yet in my formal code repository.  The code is too damn readable also 
;)  I'd hate for somebody to scoop me by building ANTLR 3 before I did 
;)

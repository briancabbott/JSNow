I recall Monty mentioning a little while ago that he did some nifty
overriding on a few parser methods (probably some tricks around match(..)
is my guess) and got it to behave like a tokenfilter/stream. If you go that
way you can just chain the parsers and you won't have to use the
TokenRewriteEngine which is not the most efficient for large input files
(whole file gets stored in memory) I'm not sure if he posted specifics
though.

Sounds very workable :) (unless the input files are very big)

&gt;<i> Oh, I do. I learned a lot already from the generated code and the examples.

</I>
Yeah I do like recursive descent as well :)

&gt;<i> I only wonder why there are so few existing grammars. I'd expect many of
</I>&gt;<i> them in such a successful package.
</I>
Dunno, there are actually quite a lot I think, although it might be bad
compared to others (not really aware of a big lex/yacc repository with
grammars, also not for some of the other competition (then again I did not
really look)).

Cheers,

Ric

 Why don't we just invite them to dinner and massacre them all when they're
  drunk? You heard the man. There's seven hundred thousand of them. Ah? ..
           So it'd have to be something simple with pasta, then.

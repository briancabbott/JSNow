Well, the last I recall ANTLR didn't handle nested {}s anyway, 
meaning that if you wanted to use them you had to use \{ and 
\}.  So that would look different, and wouldn't be a problem.

Or am I thinking of nested []s for parameters?  Or possibly I'm 
just going mad :)


Anyway, another option could be to use a magic prefix 
symbol.  @{...} springs to mind for some reason, though I don't 
know why ;)  {Maybe it's from literal strings in C#.]

There won't be another 3.0.x release. I've checked in the repos and the
source is correct there already. Not sure why you have a differing
result here. Looking at the title of this thread - was this the bug the
one mentioned in the first email? Before I work through that issue, I
ask. :)
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, array doubling is a somewhat slow algorithm for very long files - I
</I>&gt;<i> have input files with more than 100MB, which yields about 10 doublings
</I>&gt;<i> and hence copies around 1 GB of data. Below is a (not really beautified;
</I>&gt;<i> and intentionally .Net 1.1) variant which does only one copying over and
</I>&gt;<i> hence is faster (but requires twice the final memory instead of only 1.5
</I>&gt;<i> for the original algorithm).
</I>
Looking through the code, I see you mention the variable p in the first
for-loop (I would have used a do-while loop instead), but don't declare
it. Shouldn't it replaced by 0 then? You always get a fresh chunk
anyway. The next setting of p to 0 should declare then p, too.

Regarding the memory footprint - do you believe that this may be a
problem for large files? Is this speed-memory trade-off worth it (for
smaller files it looks like yes)? And how do you get C# source files
that long?

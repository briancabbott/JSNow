<PRE>Howdy,

I haven't finished the outline or course description exactly yet, but 
in case anybody in the San Francisco Bay area is interested, I'll be 
teaching a graduate computer language course at the University of SF 
near Golden Gate Park.  Small class (&lt;10 people) and everything you 
ever wanted to know about language implementation.  We'll do everything 
from garbage collection to source-to-source translation!  
Monday/Wednesday nights 6:15-8:00PM starting January 27th (as in a week 
from Monday).  You can probably audit the class for a few bucks...not 
sure how much tuition would cost to take it for a grade.

Let me know if anybody is interested in attending the class or heckling 
;)

Ter

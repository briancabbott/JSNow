I'm glad you were able to get the Token Filter approach to work for you. 
  It's definately something that can be better integrated into ANTLR the 
tool, and for certain problems it is the best approach.

I think Ter is hoping that these context sensitive lexing issues will 
disappear altogether with his new DFA based lexer.  I'd encourage you to 
try solving your problem with ANTLR 3 once Ter gets it out into the 
world.  With luck that may be this summer.

Sorry I couldn't jump into this thread while it was alive, I was on 
holiday and then buried in work afterwards.

Monty

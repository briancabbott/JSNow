<PRE>1.  I thought EOF was already generated for you, but I will add if needed
2.  I believe it
3.  Have been, still am
4.  ok

And for your question,  I am not 100% clear on what your meaning &quot;source 
file formats&quot;.  I take that as a source file in one form or another vs. 
&quot;syntax only&quot; which is just testing a given construct.  If that is true, I 
am trying to do the source (which implies a syntax recognizer also 
correct?).

Thanks Micheal for the help,
Ron



Quick comments after an even quicker scan of your grammars.

1. Rule &quot;program&quot; needs EOF at the end.
2. You'd normally skip whitespace and newlines in the lexer (this
makes your parser MUCH less complex):
   { $setType(Token.Skip); }
3. Study the Java and TinyBasic/TinyC sample grammars.
4. Rule &quot;type&quot; would normally match ID and any literals that could be
a type like DIM, &quot;string&quot; etc in your grammars.

Question: Are you planning to build a recognizer for VB6 syntax only
or for the various VB6 source file formats?

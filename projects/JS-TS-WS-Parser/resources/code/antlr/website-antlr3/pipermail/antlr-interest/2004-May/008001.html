<PRE>Ummm ...

Just a quickie (I've been reading the ANTLR manual :-) and the language
I'm implementing can use &quot;, ', or \ as the string delimiter.

Might it be an idea to have two rules

STRINGDATA : (options {greedy=false;} : (.)* ) ;
STRING : '&quot;' STRINGDATA '&quot;'
       | '\'' STRINGDATA '\''
       | '\\' STRINGDATA '\\'
       ;

And (given that I've been reading the ESC stuff :-) I presume if my
STRINGDATA looked for things like \r or \t, then the &quot;greedy=false&quot; bit
of stringdata would mean that the third option for STRING would eat the
\ before the ESC would see it?

(This is more as info for me and hints to chiplastique than a current
need for a definitive answer - I can always experiment :-)

Cheers,
Wol

Subject: [antlr-interest] Problem w/ string rule

I have the following simple lexer rule for identifying strings:

STRING
	:	'&quot;' (~'&quot;')* '&quot;'
	;

This rule should recognize any sequence of characters enclosed by 
double quotes.  However, I've discovered that strings including 
certain punctuation characters such as '\', '`', or ';' cause ANTLR 
to throw a TokenStreamRecognitionException in the STRING rule.

Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?  I'm using the 2.7.2 
runtime for C#.

Thanks!

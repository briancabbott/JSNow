Just back from Paris last night...can't sleep. :)  Hello to one and 
all.  Good trip with visions of finishing the new ANTLR web site (fully 
interactive thingie), full LL(k), sem pred hoisting, and a cool idea 
for tracking down ambiguous lookahead sequences.  I must admit though 
that the visions were a bit blurry from French wine. &lt;snicker&gt;.

Hmm....I think that the new antlr web site could provide a service 
that, given a grammar, could answer questions about it like &quot;how the 
hell can my grammar be ambiguous at this point for input ID SEMICOLON?&quot; 
  That service would incorporate the new lookahead analysis and such 
which I'd fold back into ANTLR.  I must converse with el jeffe Loring 
Craymer to discuss internal data structures for antlr; he's just made a 
foray into that DeepAndScaryJungleOfNoReturn_HereBeDragons.java stuff ;)

Anyway, gotta keep rolling with my ANTLR lectures at USF and finish up 
another website I'm building for jGuru (should be out really soon 
now...you'll dig it).  I hope to start tackling more real problems soon.

The lectures at USF should start to get more interesting now [for you 
more advanced folks].  I see that there have been about 1500 .mp3 
lecture audio downloads so far this semester.  Not too bad I guess.

In case anybody is wondering, there were 4733 downloads of ANTLR, 
&quot;download/antlr-.*.zip&quot; or &quot;download/antlr-.*.gz&quot;, in January 2003.  
Not a bad haul.  That has been consistent since I started paying 
attention last summer.  Extrapolating, one can imagine 50,000 downloads 
a year or so.  Who knows how many unique users that is.  Won't be able 
to track that until new site comes up (don't worry--no registration 
will be required!).  I think extrapolating further a little let's us 
all imagine that ANTLR dominates the java parser generator space.

At least...that's what my mother tells all her friends &lt;wink&gt;.

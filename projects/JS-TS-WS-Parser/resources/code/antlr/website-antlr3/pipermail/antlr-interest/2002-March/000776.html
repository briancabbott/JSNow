<PRE>Hi,

In current antlr you can plainly forget it to write language independent
stuff without reverting to hackery.

Maybe the fabled new AST construction stuff will make this possible.

&gt;<i> 3) The target language has to be specified in the grammar (couldn't this be

</I>
You never talked to Ter about commandline options did you ;) There's more
of these things I personally would like to see as commandline options,
#line generation options stuff like that. Antlr is because of this quite
'make' unfriendly.

Also building different configurations without getting dirty is because of
this a problem. I'd love commandline options. Terence refuses (I'm told a
pccts trauma ;) ).

&gt;<i> 4) The difficulties with trying to do grammar inheritance (see below).
</I>
&gt;<i> This isn't really criticism (ANTLR is a great tool).  Consider it ideas for
</I>&gt;<i> future releases.  
</I>
ANTLR's pretty great, but it isn't perfect..

Cheers,

Ric

 Why don't we just invite them to dinner and massacre them all when they're
  drunk? You heard the man. There's seven hundred thousand of them. Ah? ..
           So it'd have to be something simple with pasta, then.

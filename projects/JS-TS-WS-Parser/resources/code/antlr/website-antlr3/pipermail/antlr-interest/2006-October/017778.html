You won't like this reply, but this is why I don't use tree grammars. 
I've got 8 passes, each of which needs to modify the AST. I manually 
parse the tree, and cut out branches when I've finished with them (or 
replace nodes, or whatever).

The recursive tree parse in each pass is (almost) trivial, so a grammar 
would buy me little. I do have occasional complications with having to 
find my context in the tree, parsing node lists right-to-left instead of 
left-to-right, and so on, but no major problems, and certainly nothing 
that would justify maintaining 8 different grammars. One major advantage 
is that I can trivially add extra passes that do almost nothing, except 
maybe some cleaning up for the next pass.

Disclaimer: I've never actually tried the tree grammar route, so I (too) 
may have missed easy ways to do what I'm now doing manually.

There's a lot on this in the archives - have a look. You could start 
with Andy Tripp's reply in the &quot;How much use is ANTLR for manipulating 
ASTs?&quot; thread (18/06/2005).

Well, yes/no.  Turns out it is a tree now loring says ;)  You really 
need to convert a grammar to an NFA and then run a bounded k level 
NFA-&gt;DFA conversion to do the analysis (that is the algorithm I designed 
during my thesis).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is grammar subclassing still appropriate?
</I>
I think it should be a function of the environment.  I.e, have a library 
of rules/grammars in your repository and then pick and choose stuff to 
grab to begin a new grammar.  A live push-forward-changes sort of thing 
is the same as inheritance ;) (I think they call that RCS) ;) ;)

</I>
Oooooooohhhhhh.  Now THAT is the perfect explanation of what an Aspect 
is.  You don't want to modify a grammar physically just to add actions 
into the right spot!.  Oohhhh.

&gt;<i> is how to specify the join points and the answer is???  Note that your 
</I>&gt;<i> IDE
</I>&gt;<i> could still let you edit the actions as if they were attached to the .g
</I>&gt;<i> file, but in reality they don't have to be.  Nice for multipass tree

</I>
Oh man...i think we're on to something.  AspectANTLR :)

</I>
Yes, the cached lookahead information is useless for determining the 
paths in the grammar that are nondeterministic.  I would really like to 
have ANTLREclipse or whatever be able to highlight the paths for you.

The caching is absolutely necessary for efficiency of this algorithm.  
Without it I cannot claim it is O(nk) where n is size of grammar.  But, 
a new version of antlr could avoid the caching when finding the problem 
spots.

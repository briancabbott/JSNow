Vector is not obsolete, it just isn't universal. But then again, neither
is ArrayList or LinkedList. All of them implement the List interface in
different ways, that lead to them being more appropriate in different
circumstances. For example, ArrayList and Vector implement storage in
the same way, but with different growing strategies. Also, one is
synchronised and the other isn't, so if you're not sharing across
threads using the synchronised one is a bit of a waste. LinkedList, on
the other hand, is implemented very much differently, and is cheaper to
use in many ways but expensive for random access.

Stack, on the other hands, isn't described as being bad anywhere
official that I've seen, but I think Ter has prooved that it is.

Ter,

being crap, I imagine. Possibly being synchronised unnecessarily. How
did you implement your own? I've done it for my own use before on top of
LinkedList as an adaptor pattern, although the same code would work on
any List. LinkedList, however, seemed to be the best in most situations
I've seen provided it's implemented sanely.

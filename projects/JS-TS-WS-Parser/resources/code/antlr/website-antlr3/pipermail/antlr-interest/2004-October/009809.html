Windows MSVC support depends on community patches submitted to the list or
to me directly. I have the free version of MSVC 7.1 but I can't do nothing
really usefull with (lack of (nmake) makefiles with the right incantations
for the separate tools) so far I cannot build working binaries.

The biggest good thing for msvc support was MSVC 7.1 which is finally a
decent C++ compiler features wise. Now only DLL's and STL..... (or windows
people drop the DLL obsession for antlr's support lib... ;) )

</I>&gt;<i> The distribution has a sample showing how to couple Flex lexers to

</I>
Just wait till you see some antlr3 generated C code ;) (before my holidays
I hacked a bit on the prototype I made for the workshop, the new one should
be a lot faster still (using mmap just for prototype kicks)), I'll post
some rough figures when I get to finishing it)

Cheers,

Ric

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Use syntactic predicates as a first step for removing non-determinisms.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some of the ANTLR 2 reported non-determinisms are not real, and result
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the approximate LLk algorithm.  Once you have a working grammar, left-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; factor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if you need the added performance.  I note that ANTLR 3 does/will do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; automatic left-factoring and will remove predicates where they are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unneeded;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does it make sense to spend a lot of effort manually left-factoring when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tool will do it for you within a year?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks Loring,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Like most projects, I needed this yesterday or about a year ago even, so
</I>&gt;<i>waiting for ANTLR 3 is not really an option ;)
</I>
Maybe I was too terse in my response.  My point is more &quot;Don't left factor, 
use syntactic predicates first&quot;.  In your situation, left factoring is a 
form of premature optimization.  I don't suggest waiting for ANTLR 3; 
however, the fact that it will automatically left factor and remove 
unneeded syntactic predicates should give you pause before you take on the 
task of manually refactoring your grammar.  [Of course, the tradeoffs 
change if performance is a key requirement; even then, the preferred 
strategy is to get a working grammar and then left factor manually if you 
need the performance and cannot wait for ANTLR 3 to solve the performance 
problem.  In that case, you tend to start by refactoring top-level rules 
and working your way down.  In practice, though, left factoring tends to 
buy little improvement over synpreds.]

Synpreds should enable you to remove non-determinisms (even the ones 
arising from LLk-approx) from your grammar within a day, even for a large 
grammar.  Only after you have a working grammar should you worry about 
performance and whether a large scale effort to refactor your grammar makes 
sense.

So I would suggest that you continue with your own grammar (mostly because 
it is most familiar to you and sounds like it is almost working), but 
insert synpreds and defer left-factoring until and unless performance 
becomes a critical issue.  Even then, profile first.

&gt;<i>Some of the options are:
</I>&gt;<i>1) Continue on with the existing ANTLR ASN.1 grammar - I've tried running it
</I>&gt;<i>with some simple MIBs but it strikes some trouble when it gets to some of
</I>&gt;<i>the SMI-specific things and the processing of OIDs. However, if I strip out
</I>&gt;<i>all the actions and extend it from there maybe that will work. The grammar
</I>&gt;<i>seems a little incomplete, but I'm still not 100% familiar with ASN.1
</I>&gt;<i>syntax, so it's hard to tell if anything is missing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>2) Continue left-factoring, simplifying and removing recursion from my own
</I>&gt;<i>LL(k) grammar. I kept doing this yesterday with some success, but there are
</I>&gt;<i>multiple levels of recursiveness throughout the grammar and it could
</I>&gt;<i>potentially take weeks to sort through it all and then add actions, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>3) Try a LALR or other LR parser - I have put almost all of the grammar into
</I>&gt;<i>SableCC but I am being to realise how much power ANTLR has in comparison! I
</I>&gt;<i>will find out pretty soon how much work it's going to be to get the whole
</I>&gt;<i>grammar up and running! In any case, I'm going to end up with several
</I>&gt;<i>hundred generated java classes unless I can factorise the grammar down to
</I>&gt;<i>less rules. However, it appears that SableCC only allows one copy of each
</I>&gt;<i>terminal in any production!! Very annoying! I'd try yacc, etc but I really
</I>&gt;<i>just want something that presents the SMI information through a Java API.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>4) Link to the 'libsmi' library through the Java Native Interfaces - this
</I>&gt;<i>library isn't perfect, and I would lose some cross-platform compatibility,
</I>&gt;<i>but it's looking like a relatively easy option at this stage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>5) Buy a licence to Java 'jasmi' library (<A HREF="http://www.mibdesigner.com/jasmi/">http://www.mibdesigner.com/jasmi/</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>or another equivalent tool. However, I'm a relatively poor student, so would
</I>&gt;<i>be reluctant to fork out the money on my own. Also, what happens if this
</I>&gt;<i>project then goes commercial later on down the track? If the product I
</I>&gt;<i>choose requires single-user licenses or royalties then it will be expensive
</I>&gt;<i>to on-sell another product that uses that library.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So I'm leaning towards (3), (1), (2)/(4) or (5) in approximately that order.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If anyone has any suggestions or advice, I'm all ears! :D
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Cheers

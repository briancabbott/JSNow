Well, the ^ and ! should be very clear, right?  You are merely 
specifying what is a subtree root and what is to be ignored.  It's the 
interaction with #(...) etc... in 2.x that is confusing I think.

I'm trying to avoid having any special stuff in actions. :)  The 
rewrites help a lot.  I don't anticipate needing actions to build trees 
at the moment.

&gt;<i> The readability of tree construction syntax is really very poor at the
</I>&gt;<i> moment.
</I>
Thanks for the feedback!

Do you think the new rewrite stuff would be easy to understand? Some of 
surely would.  For example, build a flat tree with elements reordered:

r : A B =&gt; B A ;

Will that help do you think or is it just as bad?  I really want to get 
this right!

What are your thoughts on Loring's counter-proposal?

<PRE>How much of this is licensing? And how much of this is lawyers being
clueless? I suspect mostly the latter :-(

One only has to look at all the confusion over the meanings of the words
*licence* and *contract* to know that there are idiots everywhere -
including in the legal profession. Not helped by commercial customers
insisting on calling their crap &quot;End User *LICENSING* Agreement&quot;s, when
they are not licenses at all, but contracts.

I don't think the problem here is licensing at all. I think it's
educating lawyers. I just hope they're willing to be educated ...

Cheers,
Wol

Hi,

Bah another license discussion :/

Please people stop theorizing until Ter wakes up ;) Reread the previous
discussion on licenses in the archives and you'll know what is planned
for
next releases.

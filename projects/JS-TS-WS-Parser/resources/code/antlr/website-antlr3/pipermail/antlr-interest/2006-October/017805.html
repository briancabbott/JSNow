</I>
Here's my alternative:
I have hundreds of &quot;transformation rules&quot; where each rule can either be 
a simple mapping like this:
ADD v1 TO v2. --&gt; v2 += v1;
ADD v1 v2 TO v3 v4. --&gt; v3 += v1 + v2; v4 += v1 + v2
ADD v1 TO v2 GIVING v3.  --&gt; v3 = v1 + v2;

...or actual Java code that operates on sequences of tokens, not trees.
I find it easier to think of the source and target languages as 
sequences of tokens
(&quot;ADD&quot; followed by a variable followed by &quot;TO&quot;...) rather than trees (an 
&quot;ADD&quot; node
with the first child being a variable and the second child being &quot;TO&quot;...)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And I don't think the AST is helping you at all (at least for COBOL 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to Java)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with that design, because COBOL and Java are at least a little

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and below the statement level (as the example above shows, I can

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> map a single COBOL statement to single Java statement). But
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> above that level, the COBOL AST looks almost nothing like the Java one.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Compare this COBOL grammar to a Java one:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, right.  You just don't like ASTs.  However, it is still possible
</I>&gt;<i> to represent two completely different languages in one tree, and have
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate phases with a mixture of the two different trees walked
</I>&gt;<i> by the same grammar.
</I>

Well, yes, it's possible to represent English and Java in one tree, but
the real question is &quot;is that the best data structure for the task?&quot;

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; That both types of statements could co-exist in the same tree, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; even have different types of sub-statements.  Similarly for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; expressions--an expression could use either language's operators, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I could have passes that just dealt with arithmetic or string handling
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; or whatever, so that in one pass expressions are all arev the next
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; would have vb arithmetic and arev everything else, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I did the same for C/C++ and Java: expressions are virtually identical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> two languages. But check out expressions in COBOL:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I was raving about this like 7 years ago, it just totally rocks!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Check the archives for my posts about multiple tree grammars, or ask
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; questions if something isn't clear.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; By the last pass, I had a completely vb tree, and then I finally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; dumped it to text.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I had looked very carefully at all your stuff when I started 4 years 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ago.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My feeling is that if you're going to do a &quot;natural&quot; translation - 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that is:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> String hello = &quot;hello&quot;;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> String world = &quot;world&quot;;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> printf(&quot;%s %s\n&quot;, hello, world);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...becomes...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> System.out.println(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then the &quot;walking the AST&quot; approach doesn't come close to working.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The two ASTs for those two code chunks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have almost nothing in common, and doing that translation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is 1% a &quot;tree-manipulation&quot; problem, and 99% a &quot;code mapping&quot; problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, that problem becomes a &quot;static analysis&quot; problem and a &quot;constant
</I>&gt;<i> expression substitution that is aware of printf args&quot; problem as well.
</I>

Right. So I guess my view is just that language translation, at least 
when producing
realistic output, is 99% &quot;static analysis&quot; and 1% &quot;tree transformation&quot;.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think if tree-walking works for most of the translation work, you 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> either
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have two very similar languages, or your output code looks just like 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> input code with different syntax. &quot;I don't want 'JOBOL'&quot;, as one of my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> customers said :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> AREV &amp; VB actually had quite different syntax.  If you have a decent
</I>&gt;<i> tree structure, the difference of syntax of the languages is
</I>&gt;<i> irrelevant.  AREV had some wacky expressions, but once the program was
</I>&gt;<i> parsed the trees for statements and expressions were easy to
</I>&gt;<i> understand and manipulate.
</I>
Well, I preferred sequences of tokens over ASTs even for C to Java and 
C++ to Java,
so my views are pretty extreme. On the other hand, of all the language 
translators out there,
I don't see any that (to my eye) produce realistic, &quot;natural&quot; code, 
other than my Jazillian.
It's one thing to produce working Java (source or byte code) code from 
C. It's quite another
to produce code that looks hand-written. The logic to combine those 3 
&quot;printf&quot; statements
into a single, realistic Java one is far harder than just changing to 
Java syntax. Somewhere
in writing that code I came to realize &quot;Hey, the AST is just getting in 
the way here&quot;.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not debating you on whether your way is better or not.  I just
</I>&gt;<i> disagree with your statements about where tree walking doesn't work.
</I>
That's fair. I don't mean to say tree walking won't work here. Even the 
poster who had
just 8 phases is probably better off with a tree. If he gets to the 
point where he's got 20
phases, and only 5 of the phases are helped by the fact that ASTs are 
being used, then
he's entering my world :)

I guess what I'm doing is more akin to natural language translation. I'm 
sure an English to
Spanish translator has relatively little logic that does tree 
transformation (e.g. putting the
adjectives *after* the nouns).

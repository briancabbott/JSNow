The following information is output from gdb

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

Information output from valgrind is similiar

==32170==    at 0x4C45E78: getMissingSymbol (antlr3baserecognizer.c:2199)
==32170==    by 0x4C453E3: recoverFromMismatchedToken (antlr3baserecognizer.c:1510)
==32170==    by 0x4C447B0: match (antlr3baserecognizer.c:448)



The code should be 
                  token   = recognizer-&gt;state-&gt;tokFactory-&gt;newToken(recognizer-&gt;state-&gt;tokFactory);
   2184
   2185         // Set some of the token properties based on the current token
   2186         //
   2187         token-&gt;setLine                                  (token, current-&gt;getLine(current));
   2188         token-&gt;setCharPositionInLine    (token, current-&gt;getCharPositionInLine(current));
   2189         token-&gt;setChannel                               (token, ANTLR3_TOKEN_DEFAULT_CHANNEL);
   2190         token-&gt;setType                                  (token, expectedTokenType);
   2191
   2192         // Create the token text that shows it has been inserted
   2193         //
   2194         token-&gt;setText8(token, (pANTLR3_UINT8)&quot;&lt;missing &quot;);
   2195         text = token-&gt;getText(token);
   2196
   2197         if      (text != NULL)
   2198         {
   2199                 text-&gt;append8(text, (const char *)recognizer-&gt;state-&gt;tokenNames[expectedTokenType]);
   2200                 text-&gt;append8(text, (const char *)&quot;&gt;&quot;);
   2201         }

    I am using ANTLR3.1 for developing a SQL parser 
     
    One of my main rule looks like this 
     
    sql_statement: 
        sql_statement_command (';')? 
     
    But when generating parser codes from grammar file to C source, it always take a very long time and consume as much as 5G memory because of the optional semicolon 
    Then in order to make the development easier, I make the semicolon a mandatory by removing the question mark, like this 
     
    sql_statement: 
        sql_statement_command ';' 
     
    It does make the building faster and require much less memory.


  This indicates that there is something wrong with the formulation of your grammar - getting the terminators correct in SQL is not easy. 
     
    But the problem now is, when parsing a statement without the semicolon, such as the following 
     
    select * from tt 
     
    ANTLR won't handle this but issue a signal 11 
    His is the stack information when this happening, when all test has been matched and is going to match the last semicolon

  Yes - this probably is a bug. TO give me a bettr chance of seeing what is happening, can you rebuild the runtime with debug information included (see configure --help) and run it via valgrind? It is probably some boundary condition that I did not anticipate.

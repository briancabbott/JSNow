<PRE>Hi Joey,
Great work!  I maintain the ActionScript 3/ECMAScript 4 target for ANTLR, we
should sync up on the work that you've done since the targets should be very
similar.  It would be good to align the runtime APIs and code generation
decisions as much as possible, so there is an evolutionary path from
ECMAScript 3 to 4 that is consistent.  If done right, much of the code
generation templates and even some runtime code could be shared between the
two versions, which would simplify maintenance going forward.

George

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I write this message because I wanted to get a couple legal and scheduling

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) 99% of the JavaScript target code is original (although heavily
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inspired, of course, by the other targets).  The remaining 1% consists of a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code is licensed under the BSD license like ANTLR, so I assume this won't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cause any problems.  If this is an issue I could rewrite the code, but it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be a hassle.  Here's a link to the YUI license:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> seems ok. so you would simply be including a source code file with a
</I>&gt;<i> license a the top? Should be fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  2) It appears that the 3.1 release is imminent.  My work has been based
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> off the 3.01 release to date.  Do y'all think it would be valuable to create
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a finished 3.0.1 compatible version of the JavaScript target, or should I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> port what I have now to 3.1 and release that?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We could include 3.0.1 JavaScript target with 3.1 as long as the templates
</I>&gt;<i> worked and the runtime was consistent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I'll send out the documentation and code in about another month.  It

</I>&gt;<i> Oh okay, it seems like you will miss the 3.1 deadline; uh, like this

&gt;<i> In the next release (coming soon) you will be able to embed C++ code in

</I>
I refered to actions - as I can remeber correctly ANTLR ignores the content of 
actions. It seams I was wrong.

&gt;<i> You 
</I>&gt;<i> should keep the code in your grammar files to an absolute minimum, just
</I>&gt;<i> for maintenance reasons really.
</I>
I'm sorry I don't understand this. If I implement an interpreter I have to put 
in code inside the actions - right?

&gt;<i> Not sure what you mean by errors as return values. When a syntax error
</I>&gt;<i> occurs, it fires a series of function calls that culminate in a call to
</I>&gt;<i> displayRecognitionError. However, you can override these functions
</I>&gt;<i> (usually you only need to override the displayRecognitionError) and make
</I>&gt;<i> them do whatever you like.
</I>
I mean in C++ you throw exceptions (2.x version of ANTLR) in the case of 
errors. But exceptions are not part of C.

&gt;<i> The next release is coming shortly and this has lots more documentation.
</I>&gt;<i> I will talk to Ter about putting the new doxygen API stuff up there now
</I>&gt;<i> as while some of it wont work until 3.1, there is lots of good
</I>&gt;<i> background information in there.
</I>
that would be greate

&gt;<i> So, as far as C++ is concerned:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.0
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Compile runtime as C, compile generated code as C, use C in actions,
</I>&gt;<i> call external &quot;C&quot; API, link with C runtime library
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.1
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Compile runtime as C, compile generated code as C++ (if you need to),
</I>&gt;<i> use C+ in actions, call C++ stuff, link with C runtime API.
</I>
OK

&gt;<i> My feeling is that other than some wrapper classes for tokens and so on,
</I>&gt;<i> that might be all that C++ people really need, but we will see how it
</I>&gt;<i> pans out.
</I>
best regards,
Oliver

I think that you can tell the token stream which channel to listen to:

	public CommonTokenStream(TokenSource tokenSource, int channel) {
		this(tokenSource);
		this.channel = channel;
	}

use that ctor and I should be happy.  The parser actually will have  
no idea what channel is listening to. :)

Thanks! There are number of people who have worked very hard on this  
release, including all of the target release people and of course  
Jean Bovet with his ANTLRWorks.

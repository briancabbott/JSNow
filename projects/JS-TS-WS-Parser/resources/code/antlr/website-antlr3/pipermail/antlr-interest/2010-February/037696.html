<PRE>Hi Kyle, thanks for your thoughts!

&gt;<i> Regarding the wiki page by the same subject... I'm clearly no expert in the implementation guts but moving software stack seems like it could have a couple more benefits in addition to the ones you wrote about.  The improved &quot;separation of concerns&quot; would make it easier (at least for me!) to follow and debug the resulting target code.  Also it might accelerate the development (and maintenance) of non-Java-like targets.  
</I>
Agreed. it really makes more sense for me to manage my own stack of attributes.

&gt;<i> Also I hope Gavin Lambert's suggestion for &quot;negative context&quot; via exclusionary predicates makes it into v4. 
</I>
It's definitely useful occasionally.  ~ doesn't really work for negation because it means match something not in that set. ! means don't include but match. We need another operator I guess; some kind of variant of the syntactic predicate could make sense.

&gt;<i> True, the hybrid approach is the key architectural gem which will make v4 even more powerful for &quot;edgy&quot; grammars.    But the separate stack will potentially benefit *every* grammar.   And exclusionary predicates will afford simple expression to certain simple grammars which I suspect may actually be more common than listserv traffic would suggest.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway thanks for the glimpse into the future.   I look forward to learning v4 all over from the beginning!
</I>
I'm hoping that users won't notice the difference, at least in the first version ;)

<PRE>Hi Ron,

I think this behavior is as intended. The @init block is intended to declare local variables. Therefore, it will always be executed. 
You could move the action, manipulating your stack, out of the @init block into an action inside the rule. Then, it would not get executed during lookahead.
I don't know if it is favorable, but if this manipulation of the stack is required in the subrules to correctly decide on alternatives, you could leave the action in @init and put the cleanup action (form @after) to the &quot;finally&quot; block, which will always get executed, regardless of the backtracking state.

I hope this helps.
Thomas

Betreff: [antlr-interest] @init actions executed during lookahead,      @after actions not

Hi,

I just ran into something a little odd. I'm using @init actions in some
parser rules to stack some information and @after to pop it again. In
the generated Java code, the @after action gets wrapped in an &quot;if (
state.backtracking==0 ) {...}&quot;, so that it only gets executed when other
actions are being executed, not during lookahead. This is what I
expected. But I noticed that the @init actions are executed
unconditionally, including during lookahead. I didn't expect this. The
result was a lot of junk on the stack when it went into a dfa. The fix
was easy enough, just checking state.backtracking myself. But I was
wondering if this is an Antlr bug or if it's supposed to work this way.

Ron

<PRE>Hi,

I'm running into several problems and if some kind sould wouldn't mind
helping out, I'd really appreciate it.

I have basically this problem:
  - how to declare context dependant grammar

I want to create a language to be used as an interface to my
mathematical mophology library (i.e. image processing operators). I
think that antlr is up to the challenge but unfortunately it seems I'm
not. I've read a lot of tutorials but it seems it's not enough :(

Here is an example of a program I'd like to parse

// Start
Image image;
Kernel k1;
Kernel k2;

k1 = disk(10);
k2 = matrix(3,3);
k2[0] = &quot;001&quot;;
k2[1] = &quot;010&quot;;
k2[2] = &quot;100&quot;;

image.load(&quot;someimage.png&quot;);

Image result;
result = (image open k1) close k2;

result.save(&quot;result.png&quot;);
// End



I can't figure out how to restrict .load and .save to an image that
has been declared nor can I figure out how to differentiate between a
kernel and an image assignment since both k1 or result are viewed as
ID by the lexer.

I could do the above in C++, but I kind of would like to have an
interpreted syntax version like above to speed up my tests.

Thanks for any tips.

Phil

 &gt;wildcard is single node in tree grammar analysis but node or

 &gt;We need both single node wildcard and tree wildcard. DFA 
analysis
 &gt;sees '.' as a single node.
 &gt;
 &gt;If you say ^('+' . .), that expects two single nodes as children 

 &gt;at analysis time. The problem is that at runtime we want 
wildcard
 &gt;to match a subtree as well. We need to tell the analysis
 &gt;specifically which one we mean. I can see a situation where you
 &gt;want to match literally a single node versus a subtree. I don't
 &gt;want to flip wildcard mean subtree.

For analysis purposes, shouldn't ^(anything at all) be considered 
equivalent to a single node anyway?  In much the same way that in 
the expression &quot;x + (y + z)&quot;, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;(y + z)&quot; are both atoms (in 
terms of precedence).

I'm a bit rusty on ANTLR's internal tree representation, but 
certainly in a &quot;normal&quot; tree this is the case -- any given node 
can have a subtree (or not), and you can uniquely refer to any 
subtree by pointing at its root node.  I don't see why ANTLR would 
need to behave any differently (and I can see quite a few cases 
where it'd be beneficial if it could handle both cases at runtime, 
not compile time).

Given the original problem mentioned in the issue:
   input: ^(not ^(and ^(= a b) ^(= c d)))
   rule: ^('not' ^('and' c51=. c52=.)) -&gt; ...

I don't see how this can be misinterpreted.  While processing the 
'and' subtree, it reads the first child node, discovers that it's 
a subtree, reads the whole thing in and assigns the root node 
(with dangling subtree) to c51.  Then it does the same for the 
next subtree and c52.

Introducing separate operators for &quot;single node&quot; and &quot;subtree&quot; 
seems like a kludge, and it means that flexibility is lost; 
certain possible input trees simply won't be able to be parsed any 
more (or at least not as nicely).

Actually, this is wrong.

&quot;Cast expressions:

A cast_expression is used to explicitly convert an expression to a given
type.

cast_expression
   :    '( ' type ')'unary_expression
   ;

A cast_expression of the form (T)E, where T is a type and E is a
unary_expression, performs an explicit conversion (&#167;6.2) of the value of
E to type T. If no explicit conversion exists from E to T, a
compile-time error occurs. Otherwise, the result is the value produced
by the explicit conversion. The result is always classified as a value,
even if E denotes a variable.

The grammar for a cast_expression leads to certain syntactic
ambiguities. For example, the expression (x)&#8211;y could either be
interpreted as a cast_expression (a cast of &#8211;y to type x) or as an
additive_expression combined with a parenthesized_expression (which
computes the value x &#8211; y).

To resolve cast_expression ambiguities, the following rule exists: A
sequence of one or more tokens (&#167;2.3.3) enclosed in parentheses is
considered the start of a cast_expression only if at least one of the
following are true:

&#8226; The sequence of tokens is correct grammar for a type, but not for an
expression.

&#8226; The sequence of tokens is correct grammar for a type, and the token
immediately following the closing parentheses is the token &#8220;~&#8221;, the
token &#8220;!&#8221;, the token &#8220;(&#8221;, an identifier (&#167;2.4.1), a literal (&#167;2.4.4), or
any keyword (&#167;2.4.3) except as and is.

The term &#8220;correct grammar&#8221; above means only that the sequence of tokens
must conform to the particular grammatical production. It specifically
does not consider the actual meaning of any constituent identifiers. For
example, if x and y are identifiers, then x.y is correct grammar for a
type, even if x.y doesn&#8217;t actually denote a type.

&gt;<i>From the disambiguation rule it follows that, if x and y are
</I>identifiers, (x)y, (x)(y), and (x)(-y) are cast_expressions, but (x)-y
is not, even if x identifies a type. However, if x is a keyword that
identifies a predefined type (such as int), then all four forms are
cast_expressions (because such a keyword could not possibly be an
expression by itself).&quot;

At least this doesn't require a lexical hack.

&gt;<i> Last (but not least??), writing the expression part of a language is often a good &quot;entry point&quot; into the first unit tests that have(!!!!!) to be written for any grammar; and I think what you save up front will haunt you later when you get to the intricacies of a language ...
</I>
How would you do unit tests with ANTLR? I'm not sure how I can realize
them here.

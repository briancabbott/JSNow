Yes, although until Monty's RTFM response I didn't even know that there was
anything other than the default error handling.

&gt;<i> If the

That's right.

&gt;<i> You might get away with turning of the default (or the complete)
</I>&gt;<i> errorhandlers for the ident rule. That way the parse error is escalated to
</I>&gt;<i> the name rule and the action for with the list will not be performed.

&gt;<i> ident's error is handled at the end of the name rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ident returns [ std::auto_ptr&lt;IdentifierNode&gt; result ]
</I>&gt;<i>         options { defaultErrorHandler = false; }
</I>&gt;<i> : .......
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Depends a bit on other rules if this works 100%. Look at the generated

&gt;<i> for ident to get a feel for the effect of this.
</I>
Ok, will do. Right now this error handling stuff is a mysterious and
orthogonal dimension which I had entirely failed to consider - which is
disturbing me to say the least. I have a 1000 line .g file with C++ actions
like the above, and absolutely no handling for these kinds of errors -
working out a strategy to make the whole file error-safe seems like a
daunting task at this stage. Presumably every rule in the entire grammar
could throw a parsing exception and crash various parts of my AST generation
code - perhaps the best strategy is to turn off all error handlers, that way
the worst thing that can happen is the parser will barf, then I can slowly
re-introduce my own (or the default) exception handling at places where I
know it is safe to do so - at the statement level is one place that comes to
mind. I still don't understand how to invoke ANTLR's error recovery code if
I insert my own catch blocks.

Best wishes

Ross.

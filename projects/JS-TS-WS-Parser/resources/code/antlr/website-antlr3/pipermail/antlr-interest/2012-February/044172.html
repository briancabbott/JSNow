<PRE>&gt;<i> &#160;It's basically saying that
</I>&gt;<i> one possible form of expr is two exprs (which in turn can each be
</I>&gt;<i> another two exprs). &#160;With no other distinguishing tokens there's
</I>&gt;<i> no way to exit that path. &#160;So that way lies infinite recursion,
</I>&gt;<i> madness, and/or Sparta.
</I>
Hmm, looks like a perfectly fine grammar to me.
Not one a top-down parser would like, of course,
but no problem for bottom-up algorithms. expr
can always produce 'x', so there's nothing &quot;infinite&quot;
other than the normal ability of a grammar to produce
an infinite number of strings (it's not non-terminating).

&gt;<i> Was this from a real usage attempt (if so, please explain more
</I>&gt;<i> what you were trying), or were you just experimenting?
</I>
Awk introduced implicit concatenation about 35
years ago. Not sure if there are any earlier examples of
the implicit binary operator.

This is a one-off case, but a well-established one.
A parser generator that truly supported expressions
in their &quot;natural&quot; language should not only allow
the implicit operator, but allow the user to specify
its precedence and associativity, IMHO.

This is certainly doable bottom-up. One knows when an
expr has been seen and that the next token could start
an expr and can therefore &quot;pretend&quot; that the implicit
operator exists. Haven't thought about doing it top-down. I think
the harder problem is intelligent guidance so the user doesn't
make a mess. For example, it's problematic to try to add
this operator to C, and the parser generator has to know
quite a lot about expressions (apart from grammars) in order
to give an intelligent explanation of why that is (can't use
implicit binary if an outfix operator is overloaded to be a
postunary operator as well, as is the case in C with
'(X')' and 'X(X)').

How does Awk do it then, since it also uses parens
for both grouping and function call? Unlike C, Awk
doesn't allow a function &quot;name&quot; to be an expression.
(Awk source code at google: The One True Awk).
More complications! (Although, complications like
that particular one get unified, I think, if you use LR(0)
and then only examine inadequate states to see what
problems are left over for precedence/associativity
to attempt to resolve).

This is exactly why parser generators don't &quot;really&quot;
support expressions. To really go into that domain
requires embedding a lot of extra knowledge that's
pretty hard to get right, since it's not on a solid
mathematical foundation to start with. If you
don't try to jump in with both feet and handle
all the messes, then you only &quot;sorta&quot; support
expressions, like Yacc/Bison, and have to
(like them) leave a note mentioning that the user's
probably going to get into trouble if s/he strays outside
a few well-established usages.

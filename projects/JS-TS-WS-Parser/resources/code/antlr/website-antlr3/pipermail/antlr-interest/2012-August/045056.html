<PRE>Hi Zhaohui

I am currently working on fixing this issues with antlr3.4... Once I will have a 
proper patch, would you be interested in testing it??

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here we have a big grammar and the generated parser.java got a compilation
</I>&gt;<i> : &quot;the code for the static initializer is exceeding the 65535 bytes limit&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've searched the net for a while and found that is a widely known limit in
</I>&gt;<i> JVM or Javac compiler, and not yet has an option to change it higher.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the ANTLR side, I found 2 solutions proposed by others, but neither of
</I>&gt;<i> them is totally satisfying:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Seperate the big grammar into 2 *.g files, import one from the other.
</I>&gt;<i>     Yes, this removes the compilation error with genereated Java. But
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLRWorks does not support imported grammar well. E.g., I can not
</I>&gt;<i> interpret a rule in the imported grammar, it's simply not in the rule list
</I>&gt;<i> for interpreting. And gunit always fail with rules defined in imported
</I>&gt;<i> grammar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Modify the generated Java source, seperate the &quot;FOLLOW_xxx_in_yyy&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> constants into several static classes and change references to them
</I>&gt;<i> accordingly.
</I>&gt;<i>     This is proposed here -
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2009-November/036608.html">http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2009-November/036608.html</A> .
</I>&gt;<i> The author of the post actually has a solution into ANTLR source code (some
</I>&gt;<i> string template). But I can't find the attachment he referred to. And
</I>&gt;<i> that's in 2009, I suspect the fix could be incompatible with current ANTLR
</I>&gt;<i> version.
</I>&gt;<i>     Without this fix we have to do the modificaiton manually or write a
</I>&gt;<i> script for that. The script is not that easy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And we found a 3rd solution by ourself, that also involve changing the
</I>&gt;<i> generated Java:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Remove those FOLLOW_... constant completely, and replace the references
</I>&gt;<i> with &quot;null&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>     Surprisingly this works, just no error recovery after this, not a
</I>&gt;<i> problem for us. But we really worry this is unsafe, since it's not
</I>&gt;<i> documented anywhere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After all, we're looking for any other solution that is easier to apply,
</I>&gt;<i> asumming we'll be constantly changing the grammar and recompile the parser.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Maybe there is a way to get ANTLRWorks and gunit play well with imported
</I>&gt;<i> grammar?
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe there is already a commandline option for antlr Tool, that can
</I>&gt;<i> genereate FOLLOW_... constants in seperate classes?
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe there is already a commandline option for antlr Tool, that can
</I>&gt;<i> supress FOLLOW_... constants code generation?
</I>&gt;<i>

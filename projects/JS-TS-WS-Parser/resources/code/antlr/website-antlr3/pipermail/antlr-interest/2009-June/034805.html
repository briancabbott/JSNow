</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Then I suggest that your grammar needs some serious work.,
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, first of all, global backtracking should only be used if you don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> care about error messages or performance. It is sort of a &quot;get the job
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> done&quot; option that is useful for prototyping, proof of concept, or one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> off conversion programs (where you know the input is valid, you just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want to change it to something else).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is not true.  
</I>I assure you that it is.
&gt;<i> That is why I am referring to packrat parsing, which still guarantees 
</I>&gt;<i> linear time parsing. 
</I>And how are you guaranteeing linear time with global backtrack=true? All 
this really means is that it tries every alt you specify n the order you 
specify, which means that if your particular input is alt 12, it will 
try 11 others first. Now, that isn't quite true because ANTLR is a bit 
smarter than that, but it CAN be true. The parser time will be 
predictable and provable, but will generally spend a lot of time doing 
things it doesn't need to, and when there is a syntax error, it won't 
have much of a clue why.

What I said still applies - if your task doesn't involve a parser that 
will exist for 20 years, then who cares. If your task doesn't require 
good error messages and you don't care about resources (though I think 
you should if you will keep running the thing), then who cares.

But, if you turn on a timeout of 10000 and still cannot get through the 
grammar, then you need to consider fixing up your grammar.

&gt;<i> You can't get better complexity for a parser :-)  
</I>I am not sure what you are trying to say here.
&gt;<i> About the constant factor slowdown I dont care so much, I just need to 
</I>&gt;<i> know that the speed I currently see from my parser scales. 
</I>Speed does not scale. Without more information, I can;t answer that 
question. Do you mean, will the parser rip through a 500K file in 
proportionate time to a 1K file, then that is one thing. If you mean 
will it work on a system when there are 3000 processes doing it 
simultaneously, then that is another (that probably doesn't involve Java 
;-).

&gt;<i> About memory usage I dont care so much either, my application is using 
</I>&gt;<i> way more system resources after the parsing than the parser itself 
</I>&gt;<i> ever will.
</I>Hmmmm.

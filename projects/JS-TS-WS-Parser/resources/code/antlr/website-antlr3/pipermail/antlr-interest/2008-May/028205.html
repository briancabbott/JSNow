<PRE>I just read tparr's note that  3.1 beta is imminent.  Cool.  :)

Please check my sanity here, as I sort out my understanding of the build
labeling used in the ANTLR community.

I just installed antlr-2008-05-07.18 from the build area.

The release notes are labeled as early access and state ANTLR 3.1.  So this
is clearly a pre-3.1 build.  Ok.

The output of java org.antlr.Tool states 3.1b1.

So would I be correct to infer that what I have is 3.1b1 + changes since
3.1b1 ?

Or would I be correct to infer that what I have is what I see some people
referring to as 3.1b2 ?

I'm not anal about this, really.  I'm just trying to establish a basis for
communicating with y'all.

Thanks,
CM

P.S.
I see that antlr-2008-05-07.18 has the
org.antlr.runtime.RecognizerSharedState class I was missing.
I am now able to target CSharp2.  Yeah!
Next step is actually building a C# dll, but that will have to wait for
tomorrow.  :(
Thanks to all who have offered advice!

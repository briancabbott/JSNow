<PRE>Fantastic, thanks very much for your help!  My quoted string rule used 
to be a parser rule but I thought I could separate out the quotes in the 
parser rather than in my own Java code.  Yay for laziness. (more inline 
comments below)

&gt;<i> Another alternative here is to just use this instead:

</I>&gt;<i>   OTHER: . ;
</I>Now just to check my understanding, I thought I'd try a non-greedy loop 
to see what error it would give me (I assumed it would give an error 
since you didn't mention it as a viable solution :):

    OTHER: ( options { greedy = false; } : . )+;

Which gave me &quot;The following alternatives can never be matched: 1&quot;.  
Since the rule doesn't have some kind of terminating token (like '/*' ( 
options { greedy = false; } : . )* '*/') and it won't look at other 
rules to find out when to stop, the greedy match won't match anything at 
all.  Is that the right understanding?  Why then wouldn't it always 
match a single character due to the '+' being 1 or more matches?

Thanks again! Got it working perfectly.

<PRE>Hi,
A while ago, the following message was posted:
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2007-June/021243.html">http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2007-June/021243.html</A>
It was very valuable to me and enables me to manipulate source files
in an elegant way.
Thanks a lot Wincent!
But it seems that it was not picked up at all.
So I just add a vote here for adding the &quot;filter patch&quot; to AntLR, so
that I can remove my local patch.

Most important part of the well elaborated message:
&quot;&quot;
I'm aware that the filter mode was intended to enable the creation of
&quot;fuzzy&quot; lexers but I've also found it very useful for parsing things
like wikitext or templating languages (PHP or any like it) where you
have a large amount of free-form text (no special markup) studded
with meaningful chunks of a more formal language (wikitext
directives, PHP code sections etc). In this case you don't want to
filter out and throw away the dross; you want to keep it.

Without filtering mode it is very hard to write a lexer for this kind
of input, yet with filtering mode as it currently is implemented you
can't really use a parser either. For one thing, backtracking gets
turned on in the parser whether you want it or not, and much more
crucially any actions which you define or @after blocks which you set-
up will never be executed (although @init blocks will be); there may
be other issues as well but those are the ones I'm aware of.

Conversely, trying to write the lexer without filtering mode turned
on is fiendishly difficult.

&quot;&quot;

Perhaps you should read the ANTLR book -- or the website :)

A fragment rule is easily created -- just put the word 'fragment' 
in front of it.  This is what was known as a 'protected' rule in 
v2; a lexer rule that is intended as a fragment of another rule's 
definition rather than a possible output of the lexer in its own 
right.

Because the Digit rule was listed first and wasn't a fragment, 
when the lexer saw a 1 it was generating a Digit token.  Since 
your parser didn't recognise Digits, only Integers, you had a 
failed match.  Making it a fragment removes it as a top-level 
candidate and the lexer will output an Integer instead.

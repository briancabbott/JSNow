</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds like it. I think the information I need is in the &lt;Name&gt;.tokens 
</I>&gt;<i> file, though, so possibly I could generate some code from that.
</I>Generally not as though it might be what you need in this case, you may 
well want to say near: punctuation character ','. Or, at the 'spline' 
operator '+*^&quot; and so on. BUt if the tokens file gives you what you 
need, then a few minutes of awk should transform it in to a C struct for 
you :-)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm already maintaining my own version of C.stg for other reasons, so I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> could make changes to that if necessary.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let me know if there is something that you changed that really needs to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be in the main template - I know of at least two things that I need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resolve (@after for instance), but obviously would prefer that you can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use the main branch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The changes are fairly trivial:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - fixed a few compiler warnings (for my grammar at least)
</I>OK - I want the output to go through -Wall/W4 without any warnings so I 
will check your changes.
&gt;<i> - added some types to cTypeInitMap (some standard, some specific to my 
</I>&gt;<i> project)
</I>Sure - not much we can do about that.
&gt;<i> - #undef ADD (which is defined by a system header somwhere, annoyingly)
</I>Ah - the way to get around that is not to undef ADD but to change your 
token name to KADD, then you can ignore the system header.
&gt;<i> - a quick fix to get my grammar building under MinGW.
</I>Should already do so, but I am trying to keep MingW supported, so I 
should like to try and incorporate your changes.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've attached a diff against C.stg from 3.1.3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Thanks - I will look at bringing in the fixes.

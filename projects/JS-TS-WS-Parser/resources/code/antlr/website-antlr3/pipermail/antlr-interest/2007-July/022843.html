I've been incredibly busy the past several months, but
am now back in a position where I have time and
research funding.  I should have a current version
posted to sourceforge soon; I am in the process of
finishing a v2 to Yggdrasil translator (includes
template conversion of v2 actions).

</I>&gt;<i> amount of code stored in the grammars and make
</I>&gt;<i> testing easier.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One of the other things I found a bit difficult to
</I>&gt;<i> deal with is testing
</I>&gt;<i> grammars for C# using AntlrWorks.  Before adding
</I>&gt;<i> actions to the grammar file
</I>&gt;<i> I just needed to change the language to Java for
</I>&gt;<i> testing and then back to
</I>&gt;<i> CSharp before building.  This bit me a few times
</I>&gt;<i> when I forgot to change it
</I>&gt;<i> back to CSharp after testing and would take awhile
</I>&gt;<i> before I realized that
</I>&gt;<i> the resulting binary was using a old version of the
</I>&gt;<i> grammar.  I updated my
</I>&gt;<i> build scripts to delete the old files before running
</I>&gt;<i> antlr to ensure build
</I>&gt;<i> would fail if I forgot to change the language back,
</I>&gt;<i> but once I started
</I>&gt;<i> adding code to the grammar I could no longer use
</I>&gt;<i> AntlrWorks directly.  So I
</I>&gt;<i> kept a version without the action code and then
</I>&gt;<i> began copying and pasting
</I>&gt;<i> changes, but this wouldn't really work if you needed
</I>&gt;<i> to implement a
</I>&gt;<i> predicate in code.  I saw something about using the
</I>&gt;<i> remote debugger but
</I>&gt;<i> haven't really tried it yet.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One thought that occurred to me was using
</I>&gt;<i> StringTemplate to generate
</I>&gt;<i> different grammars for each language, which I
</I>&gt;<i> suppose would work but ideally
</I>&gt;<i> I think it would be great if there was a language
</I>&gt;<i> independent way of
</I>&gt;<i> invoking actions and predicates.  Rather than
</I>&gt;<i> actually implementing the
</I>&gt;<i> action in the grammar you would implement a class it
</I>&gt;<i> in your target language
</I>&gt;<i> and simply tell antlr the method name to invoke,
</I>&gt;<i> stuffing the local vars
</I>&gt;<i> into a map/hashtable or something, additionally the
</I>&gt;<i> parser wouldn't need to
</I>&gt;<i> worry about the action changing internal variables,
</I>&gt;<i> just don't pass them
</I>&gt;<i> along to be changed.  By delegating to an object
</I>&gt;<i> provided during creation
</I>&gt;<i> one could perhaps even use the same grammar to
</I>&gt;<i> perform completely different
</I>&gt;<i> tasks using the same grammar.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was also wondering how difficult it might be to
</I>&gt;<i> collapse the switch and
</I>&gt;<i> if/else logic into an object and the rule would just
</I>&gt;<i> ask it to predict the
</I>&gt;<i> alternative and then invoke the action for that
</I>&gt;<i> alternative if any.  I'm
</I>&gt;<i> guessing some object representation probably must
</I>&gt;<i> already exist in the tool
</I>&gt;<i> to generate the code in the first place.  If all the
</I>&gt;<i> code generation could
</I>&gt;<i> be reduced to simply creating object instances
</I>&gt;<i> rather than generating
</I>&gt;<i> language specific code it may become possible to
</I>&gt;<i> actually create a
</I>&gt;<i> lexer/parser at runtime rather than compile time. 
</I>&gt;<i> Regular expressions, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, are widely used for simple lexers and input
</I>&gt;<i> validations and I think
</I>&gt;<i> a big part of the reason is that there isn't any
</I>&gt;<i> need to complicate the
</I>&gt;<i> build process with a regular expression parser
</I>&gt;<i> generator and you can use
</I>&gt;<i> them in sandboxed environments such as an internet
</I>&gt;<i> browser.  What might one
</I>&gt;<i> use a runtime parser for anyway?  AntlrWorks perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> for starters!  But also
</I>&gt;<i> for batch file processing  and documentation
</I>&gt;<i> generators; there are so many
</I>&gt;<i> different file formats for the same basic bits of
</I>&gt;<i> data that businesses often
</I>&gt;<i> write numerous programs that simply translate one
</I>&gt;<i> file format into another,
</I>&gt;<i> and documentation generators should be more
</I>&gt;<i> concerned with generating good
</I>&gt;<i> quality output rather than trying to create parsers
</I>&gt;<i> for every potential
</I>&gt;<i> language they want to support.  These tools might
</I>&gt;<i> allow the users to
</I>&gt;<i> redefine the definition of certain grammar elements
</I>&gt;<i> (since token names would
</I>&gt;<i> obviously be important to the consumer it might not
</I>&gt;<i> allow you to edit the
</I>&gt;<i> entire grammar, but they  could perhaps allow
</I>&gt;<i> changes to the rule
</I>&gt;<i> definitions and perhaps the addition of new tokens
</I>&gt;<i> and/or fragments) .  For
</I>&gt;<i> more complex customization where predicates and
</I>&gt;<i> actions might need to be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented the user might create a jar or assembly
</I>&gt;<i> file the program can
</I>&gt;<i> load at runtime.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thoughts?

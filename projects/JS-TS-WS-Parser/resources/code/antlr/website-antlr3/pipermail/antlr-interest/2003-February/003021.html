I have a Hi-8 video camera, but not a DV camera which easily plugs into 
my OS X box.  Also, w/o someone watching the camera, I might move off 
screen with my acrobatics ;)

Slides would be easier to follow, but I don't like presenting slides: 
harder to get a lot of information (like big code) on the screen and I 
forget what I meant to say.  Having notes written out is better for 
students (as there is no book for the class) and easier for me to prep 
next time I teach the class.

I'm glad it was easy to follow.  I have learned over the years of 
public speaking not to use slang or &quot;big&quot; words and to speak as slowly 
as possible.  8/10 students in my classes so far have been non-native 
English speakers. :)

Let us hope the trend continues and the audio is useful!

Does any ANTLR-o-phile live in the San Francisco area that would lend 
me their DV camera with a pass-through analog to digital converter?  
Perhaps I should just buy a damn DV camera.  I still need someone to 
move the camera though.

<PRE>Hi,

I need to accept statements like:

  &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;

and retrieve the quoted strings (i.e. &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot;).

When it didn't work as expected I decided to boil it down to its simplest
components.  I would expect the following to match, but it doesn't:

ruleA : QUOTED_TEXT 'and' QUOTED_TEXT 'and' QUOTED_TEXT;

QUOTED_TEXT : '\&quot;' ( options {greedy=false;} : .)* '\&quot;'
{ setText(getText().substring(1, getText().length() - 1)); } ;

With the text '&quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;' (without the single quotes) it produces
the following output:

line 1:8 mismatched character '&quot;' expecting 'w'
line 1:19 required (...)+ loop did not match anything at character '&lt;EOF&gt;'
line 1:9 mismatched input 'b' expecting 'and'

Changing ruleA so one of the quoted strings is replaced by the QUOTED_TEXT
lexical removes any errors.  For example, the following ruleA definition
works:

ruleA: '&quot;a&quot; and' QUOTED_TEXT 'and &quot;c&quot;';

So, my question is, what have I missed?  (This is using IDEA 8 with the
latest antlr works plugin by the way).

Many thanks,

Col
</PRE>

I'm not a lawyer, but I'm guessing we're not exposed ;)

</I>
Well, &quot;we ask&quot; not &quot;you must&quot; was the way I put it.  I didn't want 
anything in there that forced people to do anything at all.  Note that I 
pretty much just threw this RIGHTS file together w/o much thought to 
protecting myself--just wanted everyone to be able to use the tool.

&gt;<i> clause.  You could still have a nasty argument that the author only
</I>&gt;<i> intended their code to be distributed under this modified public 
</I>&gt;<i> domain, a
</I>&gt;<i> sortof license, and not some arbitrary license you later chose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other this is kind of unlikely, but anyway...
</I>
Hmm...perhaps it's time for a formal license.  I will contact some of 
the people I know that gained from the public-domain status.

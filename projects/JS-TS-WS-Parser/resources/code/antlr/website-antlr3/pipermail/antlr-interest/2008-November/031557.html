</I>Hi Andy,
I agree with you that rewrite from on AST to another AST could be hard :)

But what Simon was saying is to use the Antlr tree rewrite + a custom 
TreeAdaptor to build
the javac tree directly, rather than using the Antlr tree built from the 
tree rewrite grammar with a tree walker,
then generating the javac tree.

</I>For example, the javac node for Compilation unit has three children : 
package annotations, package declaration,  definition list(including 
types imported from &quot;import&quot; and class/interface/enum declaration).

The Java.g grammar I used , from here 
<A HREF="http://antlr.org/grammar/1152141644268/Java.g,">http://antlr.org/grammar/1152141644268/Java.g,</A> defines compliationUnit 
like this:

compilationUnit
    :   annotations
        (   packageDeclaration importDeclaration* typeDeclaration*
        |   classOrInterfaceDeclaration typeDeclaration*
        )
    |   packageDeclaration? importDeclaration* typeDeclaration*
    ;


importDeclaration is NOT part of typeDeclaration here.
Of course, I could tweak the rules to make it generate what I need, but 
it'll just make the grammar hard to read. Besides, I don't want to write 
another Java.g  myself:)

XPath is particularly nefarious, but not just with regards to keywords.

	foo()

That's either a node-type-test, if 'foo' is equal to 'comment' or
'node', but it might be a function (possibly user-defined) otherwise.
You also have to be able to deal with:

	foo:bar()

I think I ended up with a parser rule that have 5 predicates to decide
exactly what was going on, to determine if 'foo' was a node-type name,
a namespace-prefix, or possibly a user-function.

I hate to say it, but I found it easier to write an XPath lexer/parser
by hand than to convince an antlr grammar to do the right thing.

	If you're just trying to parse xpaths, might I recommend 
	taking a look at SAXPath (<A HREF="http://saxpath.org/">http://saxpath.org/</A>), which provides
	the xpath parse-events in a style like SAX does for XML,
	if you're using Java.  Though, I think SAXPath has been
	ported to Python, and maybe C++?

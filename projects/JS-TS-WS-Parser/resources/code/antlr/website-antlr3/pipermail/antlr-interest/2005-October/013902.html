<PRE>Prashant:
 
Cool, I'll wait for the final release then. I look forward to trying out
your product, and good luck with it. BTW, add my vote for a Visual Studio
version of the plug-in. Debugging a C++ parser would really be at the top of
my wish list though.
 
Don

Please note that this is not the final antlrstudio site. It is currently
meant only for people who would like to try out a pre release version of AS.
As such it contains very little information and handholding. Its really just
a bunch of html files which i manually update with hand to announce the
release of videos and betas.

The new web site which i am currently designing, which will be up on the day
of the final release, will have all the information that you possibly need
to understand and get started with ANTLR Studio :)

<PRE>Hi., 
  Thanks Martin and David.
 
Let me clear my question in detail.
The follwing are the lines frequently seen inside comments
 in the souce files from Borland C++ Builder 5.5 free command line tool compiler 
(www.borland.com/bcppbuilder/freecompiler/)
check the files vector.h, utility.h, streambu.h in /Borland/BCC55/Include/
 
/*******************************************************************************
 * U.S. Government Restricted Rights.  This computer software is provided
 * with Restricted Rights.  Use, duplication, or disclosure by the
 * Government is subject to restrictions as set forth in subparagraph (c)
 * (1) (ii) of The Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software clause
 * at DFARS 252.227-7013 or subparagraphs (c) (1) and (2) of the
 * Commercial Computer Software &#150; Restricted Rights at 48 CFR 52.227-19,
 * as applicable.  Manufacturer is Rogue Wave Software, Inc., 5500
 * Flatiron Parkway, Boulder, Colorado 80301 USA.
 *
 **************************************************************************/ 
 
While parsing these lines with the general COMMENT (multiline) rule, 
parser stops by throwing error 

C:/Borland/BCC55/Include/utility.h: expecting '*', found '&#150;' 

Got this message and included a special char token (&#251;) in the LEXER, but of no use... eventhough my charVocabulary was included with that special char token.

Already I tried and tired a lot to skip this error but fruitless. Actually I want to 
analyze the whole package of Borland application in order to evaluate my 
Master Thesis (Theme: Obtaining variants in C/C++ through conditional compilation) and
 due to the above error i could not able to parse all the files completely. 
Its still annoying.
 
I kindly request ANTLRs' to give me some tips to overcome the error.
 
I'm puzzled but not puzz'ling anybody.
 
Thanks.,
Prem

Replied Message from David on 25 July
 
 
Hello,

What interested me about the message from Prekumar of 24 July 
was how in some source code a hyphen (&quot;-&quot;) could become 
displayed as a &quot;u&quot; circumflex (&quot;&#251;&quot;)in DOS mode when the ISO 
8859-1 value of the first is 45 and the second 251 (with a 
difference of 206.

What happens when you use the hyphen for the subtraction 
operator in your source code?

What is the significance of it being in a comment?

What coding system is being used in the source code?

Is this a problem with a particular IDE?

Are we talking MS or UNIX?

Yours puzzled,

David.

Hi Everyone.,
   In source codes often comments comes with some kind of
   special characters like &#251; etc.,
Consider a Comment Line:
/*  Computer Software - Restricted Rights */

In the above comment line, hyphen ('-') between &quot;Software&quot; and 
&quot;Restricted&quot;
looks normal but when we view that in DOS editor it shows
'-' as &#251;.
My comment line token
Comment
  : &quot;/*&quot;
   ( {LA(2) != '/'}? '*'
   | EndOfLine //{newline();}
   | ~('*'| '\r' | '\n')
   )*
   &quot;*/&quot;  {$setType(Token.SKIP);}// newline();}
  ;

So, I placed a token with that special character in the parser.
But still I'm getting error. The file could not be parsed anymore.

I'm a newbie..please help me to overcome the error.

Thanks in advance.,
Prem

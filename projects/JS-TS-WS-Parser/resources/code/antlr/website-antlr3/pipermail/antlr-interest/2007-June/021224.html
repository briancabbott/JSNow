<PRE>Jim - I used the C target for the first time today - nice job! Looking
at the code, I'm glad I use C++ to do OO ;-)

Anyway - couple of issues (guess I ought to mention I'm using the
version of the runtime that comes with the release of Antlr 3.0 - if
there's a later version of the runtime I ought to be using, please let
me know!!!) -

1. You use the presence of the macro 'WIN32' to determine that you're
compiling for Windows 32. However, you might be better using '_WIN32'
(see <A HREF="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b0084kay(VS.80">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b0084kay(VS.80</A>).aspx).
'WIN32' is added to the command line by Visual Studio 2005, whereas
'_WIN32' is *always* defined. I compiled my first sample grammar at
the command line (what can I say - I'm an old-fashioned sort of a
developer), and it complained about not finding 'antlr3config.h', as
it was following the Unix path.

2. The release mode static library for Windows is compiled using the
'_fastcall' calling convention (when using the Visual Studio 2005
project). Is this for a reaason other than performance? Anyway - the
header file doesn't mark the functions exported from the library as
'_fastcall', which means that the application won't link using the
default compiler options. Could I suggest either a) changing the
library to use '_cdecl' (I don't think the performance impact will be
significant), or b) marking the exports as '_fastcall' in the header
file. Either option will work better with the default compiler
settings. I guess b) is the optimal choice?

Apart from that, I found your runtime very easy to get up and running
- took about half an hour, including building the runtime and
deciphering the runtime source to determine what sequence of calls to
tie file stream, lexer, token stream and parser together.

<PRE>Actually, tree pattern matching tools and languages typically use '_'  
to mean wildcard subtree (or actually &quot;don't care&quot;). I wonder if this  
is better because it is more readable:

^('+' _ _ )

  looks better than

^('+' ^(.) ^(.))

Then

^('+' . .)

would indicate matching '+'-rooted subtree with two leaf nodes as  
children.  If the children were subtrees, you'd get a syntax error.

Hmm... ^(.) or _ actually is just a rule:

wildcard : ^(. .+) ;

 From Johannes' post:

&gt;<i> I don't see anything wrong with this suggestion, even if it creates  
</I>&gt;<i> some
</I>&gt;<i> work on my side. ;) Looking at the nature of the bug, fixing it this  
</I>&gt;<i> way
</I>&gt;<i> won't change the behaviour of already generated and written  
</I>&gt;<i> grammars, right?
</I>
Actually, it might break some things because '.' matches an entire  
subtree right now; I would be changing in to specifically match a  
node. The problem is that we use it for both right now, which is just  
plain wrong. anybody using it has a potential bug in there.   
Fortunately, people are probably not using wildcard entry grammars too  
much.

ugh... sorry about this, I thought I was being clever at some point in  
the past; blech.

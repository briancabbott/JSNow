Well, doing it in actions is the ANTLR way.  You do have to tell ANTLR 
which regions are interesting and which aren't.  If ANTLR were to 
support that it would mean annotating your parser with yet another 
symbol, which is actually ok with me but not with Terence.  I've been 
advocating for support of user specified domain specific language 
notations in ANTLR itself for quite a while and Ter hasn't seen the 
light yet.

In any event someone has to figure out the right way to do it first....

For this one it's almost like I would want to specify it in an aspect 
oriented way like

region_rules {
statement;
expression;
declaration;
typeName;
}

And then we'd want ANTLR to add a little bit of code to rule entry &amp; 
exit to maintain that stack by pushing and popping region objects.  
Then constructing tree nodes would add a reference to the current 
region object.

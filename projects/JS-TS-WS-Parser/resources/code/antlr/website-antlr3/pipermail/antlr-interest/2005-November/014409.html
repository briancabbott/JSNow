<PRE>ALL databases?

Sorry for jumping on my hobbyhorse, but from your other messages, you
seem to be assuming that columns and tables are universals. They are NOT
:<i>-)

Subject: [antlr-interest] Upgrade a token/AST from inside the parser.

Hi,


I am currently working on a SQL parser (we want to support all
databases,
but I am taking baby steps). I used the MS SQL select statement from
Tomasz Jastrzebski that can be downloaded from antlr.org. It checks my
statements ok, but that is not the only result I am looking for.

What I want is that after the parsing the tokens contain extra
information
about their syntactic nature. For instance, the parser will find out
that
a certain 'identifier' is actually a column and I would like that
knowledge to become part of the token or the AST.

I am new to all of this, so if this is something you guys do all day
please let me know.

If it is not, could you point me in the right direction.


Kind regards,


Jan van der Ven

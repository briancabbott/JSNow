I recall when Ruby support was dropped, they showed some statistics
from the Gesture collector on how many people use it. So far as I
recall, it was dropped because very, very few people actually used the
plugins. I don't remember the stats off the top of my head, but at the
time I recall thinking it was probably the right decision. Since that
time, they've been able to dedicate more resources to other projects,
many of which are really neat (~7.1 branch).

So, I don't work for Oracle and have no vested interest, but I don't
think it was so much commercial interests as it was a lack of interest
from the community.

Just my opinion. Awesome work, Ter, you and Sam are moving going fast!

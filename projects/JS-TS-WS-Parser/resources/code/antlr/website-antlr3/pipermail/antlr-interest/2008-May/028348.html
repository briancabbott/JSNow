<PRE>Hi @ all

First of all let me apologize for the english mistakes you will surely 
find in this message.

So, I just started working with ANTLR a few days ago.

I was able to generate a parser and lexer for the lua grammar provided 
on the site.
Now I also was able to create nodes / sub trees using the ^ parameter in 
the grammar.
I also modified the grammar a bit to try to generate what i really 
wanted in the end.

One of the rule i added for exemple is the following one:
globalfuncdec    :    'function' ^ funcname funcbody ;

so for every global function (declaration not starting with local) i get 
a subtree with the funcname and funcbody block.
Now what would really be nice is a way to get the funcname as 1 token 
and not more.
funcname is the following rule:
 funcname : NAME ('.' NAME)* (':' NAME)? ;

in the same way having just a childnode named funcbody with all the 
stuff related to funcbody under it would be great.

So i would have something like that:
                                function
                               /            \
            funcname/value         funcbody
                                             /           \
                                         stuff_1  ... stuff_n

So I was wondering if one can do such a thing, and if yes, how ?

Best Regards,

</PRE>

Yes, the content may not have all been there -- just generated the grammar
successfully (no internal error).

Page 146 of the DAR only shows an example using a single token &quot;ids+=ID (','
ids+=ID)*&quot;, but it just seemed like a logical extension that it would work
for synthetic tokens specified as an inline union, as well. The tilde
operator is doing its job on the union of tokens -- it's just the +=
operator that's having trouble storing the result.

And that's probably what causes the internal error when a tree rewrite rule
is added, because only then is the value of $v actually used.

This seems like something that would make sense to support, although in the
mean time, a better error message would help.

Yes, thank you for your comments and for looking so closely.

<PRE>Thanks for all the feedback folks!!

Note that it's early access (meaning it's nowhere near what we'd call  
an alpha release) so we are expecting lots of problems.  Also, a wide  
variety of different platforms/environments will definitely cause us  
trouble at first since we couldn't test it everywhere.  Java has  
truly shown it's &quot;write once, debug everywhere&quot; nature for Swing so far.

Perhaps we messed up the jar.  I have been using ANTLRWorks to do my  
examples.  Works great for me.  Strange.  Yes, the console is full of  
&quot;noise&quot;, but I asked Jean to put that in there so we can see any  
errors that pop up.  Naturally when you're typing a grammar, it's  
invalid until you finish the rule or whatever so you'll get lots of  
errors.

Keep the comments coming!

Ter

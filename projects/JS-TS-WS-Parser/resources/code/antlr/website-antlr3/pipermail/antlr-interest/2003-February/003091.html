Yes, I've tried it now -- works fine. But maybe it should be possible
to install antlr and antlr-config without recompiling the java? No
biggie though. The compiling works fine and all. Just, well, you're
not supposed to have to recompile java when the source hasn't changed? ;)

&gt;<i> &gt; -- make install should install everything that's necessary. is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; antlr directory necessary? it certainly appears to be, but I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sure. just antlr.jar and/or antlrall.jar appear not to be sufficient.

Yes, you are correct -- my problems were caused by the lack of export
in the antlr wrapper, which I hadn't caught yet.

&gt;<i> There's no functionality in automake that that is not easily added

&gt;<i> current Makefile's. Automake will only make it harder for me to maintain

</I>hell).
&gt;<i> So in short I won't do it, and I will not accept patches on antlr to
</I>&gt;<i> support it either.
</I>
OK, apologies for jumping to conclusions -- it just seems like most
programs are using automake these days. But I'm only just learning
about it so I don't really know what it's like to debug, etc.

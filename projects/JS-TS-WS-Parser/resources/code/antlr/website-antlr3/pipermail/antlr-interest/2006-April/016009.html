<PRE>It works fine with 1.5 but the generated code incurs warnings that should be removed at some point. JDK 1.5 works fine on MAC now so perhaps ANTLR 3 could be updated to accommodate it at some point.

Interesting... so with 1.5 is does not work but with 1.4 it works?

	Update:
	
	After sending my email, I realized that I did have a 1.4 JDK installed, and that does work.
	
	So, maybe this is a report that the Java code generation does not compile without tweaking under Java 5.0.  :-)
	
	Thanks!

		Is there a trick to getting ANTLR Works to compile a grammer and working in the debugger?

		Does the Java code generated work with Java 5.0?  (Yes, I do get java files created.)  Do I need to downgrade to Java 1.4 while developing in ANTLR Works?
		
		Besides that, this has a lot of promise.  I'm hoping that once the debugger is functional, I will be able to actually run the grammar against a file and see whatever output I need to produce?  Is ANTLR v3 considered stable enough that I should use that, still as a beginner, over v2? 
		
		Thanks!

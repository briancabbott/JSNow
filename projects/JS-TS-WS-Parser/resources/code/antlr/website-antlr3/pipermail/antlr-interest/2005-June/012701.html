<PRE>&gt;<i> I have worked out why the color coding seems to be broken: a  
</I>&gt;<i> careful examination of how it breaks, and a sip of Bridgeport IPA,  
</I>&gt;<i> showed that it is out by 1 character position for each line. This  
</I>&gt;<i> is because it is only parsing correctly when the newline sequence  
</I>&gt;<i> is the UNIX \n only (and, I imagine, the MAC \r). Files that came  
</I>&gt;<i> from some Windows editor will usually have \r\n and the syntax  
</I>&gt;<i> highlighting (and the editor pane in general) are not dealing with  
</I>&gt;<i> this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You will find it all magically works if you use gvim to rewrite the  
</I>&gt;<i> file with \n as new line only. You could use any number of ways to  
</I>&gt;<i> change the end of line character of course.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Whow! I think you are right! Great job!

That's why I have difficulty to reproduce that because even on Linux/ 
Windows, I am using files coming from the Mac OS X box.

I have read a long time agon in the JTextPane API description that  
&quot;...while the document is in memory, the &quot;\n&quot; character is used to  
define a newline...&quot;. Apparently, this is not always the case....
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I found my use of the tool to be greatly enhanced once  
</I>&gt;<i> this worked properly. The only thing I could do with now is a bit  
</I>&gt;<i> more documentation on what is syntactically different in this pre- 
</I>&gt;<i> release. Once I found the 3.0 demo stuff I made strides forward.  
</I>&gt;<i> Though it is pretty reasonable to expect that if you are using the  
</I>&gt;<i> pre-release you will have to wing it a bit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Great!

&gt;<i> My only fear (hoping not to start a religious war) is that  
</I>&gt;<i> graphical tools built in Java always seem to crash, hang, have slow  
</I>&gt;<i> GUIs and so on (at least on windows, and though it would be easy to  
</I>&gt;<i> blame Windows, I don&#8217;t think that is the issue). At the moment this  
</I>&gt;<i> tool suffers form the same issues &#8211; though I am loathe to offer any  
</I>&gt;<i> judgment at this stage in the game &#8211; I would prefer to contribute  
</I>&gt;<i> to its betterment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It would be very handy to have a report of what kind of crash did  
occur and after what serie of commands.

&gt;<i> I very much like the syntax diagrams, though I have not decided if  
</I>&gt;<i> they are just a cool gimmick for the programmer or not yet. They  
</I>&gt;<i> certainly will aid in documentation enormously. Perhaps we could  
</I>&gt;<i> have a mode that could export all the syntax diagrams at once  
</I>&gt;<i> (sorry if it is there and I missed it)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I will think about that. Currently, you can export only one diagram  
at a time in an image file. I will see what I can do for PDF ;-)

&gt;<i> I would suggest that errors from parsing the grammar appear by  
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;check grammar&#8221;, or &#8220;Build&#8221;, in their own pane, instead of the Java  
</I>&gt;<i> console, and be able to double click them to locate the error in  
</I>&gt;<i> the source code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I will think more about that ;-) Note that the errors appearing by  
&quot;check grammar&quot; are indicated by a yellow icon in the rules/tokens list.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don&#8217;t prompt for output locations all the time, but allow a change  
</I>&gt;<i> of &#8216;properties&#8217; if the programmer wants to change the output  
</I>&gt;<i> location after the first run.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I can set a preferences for that, sure.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In light of the above, perhaps have a project file that hold such  
</I>&gt;<i> things. Borrowing from some of the good things in like Visual  
</I>&gt;<i> Studio .Net 2003 (err, I mean the freeware tools such as Eclipse),  
</I>&gt;<i> is not a bad idea. I realize of course that there was quite an  
</I>&gt;<i> effort to get to this point first and such things tend to get  
</I>&gt;<i> filled in afterwards.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, that's may be interesting!


Thanks for these comments and for your help about the syntax coloring  
behavior!

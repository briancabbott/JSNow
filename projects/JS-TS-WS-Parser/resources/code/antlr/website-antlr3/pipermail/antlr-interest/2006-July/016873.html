There have been a few reports of people triggering this assert. It's
on my antlr 2.7 todo list. But so far I lacked a concise example that
triggered it. If you can get me a somewhat minimal example that
triggers it. (compiling code + input) Then I can look at it. If I have
to reconstruct the problem myself then it will probably stay shelved
untill my holidays.

&gt;<i> It seems to be related to my throwing a SemanticException from within
</I>&gt;<i> the parser (during some validation).  Here is the actual code that
</I>&gt;<i> triggers it:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> if ( node-&gt;getFirstChild()-&gt;getType() == GTokenTypes::GTaggedRange ) {
</I>&gt;<i>   if ( node-&gt;getText() != &quot;requiredrange&quot; ) {

</I>&gt;<i>       &quot;tag: '\\&quot; + node-&gt;toString() + &quot;' is missing required tagged range&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>       getFilename(),
</I>&gt;<i>       node-&gt;getLine(),
</I>&gt;<i>       node-&gt;getColumn());
</I>&gt;<i>   }
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>
It's probably significant to know the grammar construct in which it is
used (and it may also be dependant on the input)

&gt;<i> Nothing out of the ordinary, I don't think, and I use similar code in

</I>&gt;<i> that I manually created during parsing i.e. with:
</I>
I strongly doubt wether it is the imaginary token. I would search
along the lines of newly introduced syntactic/semantic predicates or a
change in the test input.

&gt;<i> The failed assertion only began showing up once I introduced this dummy
</I>&gt;<i> header token, but it could be coincidence (and I have used other dummy
</I>&gt;<i> header tokens without problems in other parts of the parser).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I realize everyone is working hard on the upcoming ANTLR3,
</I>
I wish I was working on ANTLR3 ;) (or able to sync up on 2 stuff)

&gt;<i> but if someone could spare a few moments to help me out, I would really
</I>&gt;<i> appreciate it!
</I>
My time is pretty limited but I'll try and have a look again. If you
can provide code to reproduce it, then that would speed things up
significantly.

Cheers,

Ric

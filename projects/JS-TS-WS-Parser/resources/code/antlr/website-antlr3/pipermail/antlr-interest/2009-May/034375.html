<PRE>Thank you very much for your insights regarding the benefits of 
primitive types as objects.  At this time, I don't see the value 
but I am glad to have your perspective so I can think about it 
a little more.


&lt;&lt;&lt;
Are you designing a language? If so, may I recommend that you don't? The 
world does not need another language that is naively designed. I don't 
mean to be rude, but this phenomenon is responsible for a lot of poorly 
designed languages coming into widespread use, and the consequences are 
real and negative.
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yes, I would like to create a programming language.  Over the years I've 
found languages that I liked but didn't have language feature X. Currently,
I am looking to incorporate language features that I think would be of
benefit while keeping the complexity very low. I realize the consequences
are real and negative however even committees who have designed languages
have not satisfied every user or eliminated every flaw.  Advances in most
everything come with negatives, so I will just do my best to eliminate as
many of those negatives as possible.


Thank you,


Waverly

I know nothing about C#, but Java's five integer types, two 
floating-point types and its boolean type are implemented by 
machine-level entities, not objects. There are counterparts for each of 
them (the so-called &quot;boxed&quot; primitive types).

Scala makes all of these types objects (they call them Value Types) but 
wherever possible generates JVM bytecode to use the primitive types and 
save the overhead of boxing and unboxing.

The benefit is substantial. Having entities in the type system that are 
exceptions to most of the rules about what user-defined types can do 
gets in the way of many things. You cannot, e.g., use an &quot;int&quot; as a key 
or value in a map data structure. Examples abound.

Furthermore, the cost of using boxed types is probably not as big as 
your intuition is telling you. Depending, of course, on the nature of 
the program. It would be hard to do a competitive FFT using boxed 
floating-point types, I suspect.


&gt;<i> I have a couple of books on language design but none of them address

</I>&gt;<i> someone could direct me towards a good reason to implement this in a

If you really want to work in programming language design, then learn 
where the frontiers really are and concentrate your efforts there. 
Unless you're some kind of genius, nothing you think up as an offhand 
good idea is likely to be a real contribution to the field.


Again, I don't mean to offend, just to guide you towards learning the 
field of programming languages before trying to contribute innovations 
to it.

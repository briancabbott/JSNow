<PRE>hiya.  Anybody got a cool product / tool to show off?  Here's a conference.
Ter
---------------------
Tenth IEEE International Working Conference
on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation

12th-13th September 2010,
Timisoara, Romania,
Co-located with ICSM 2010

<A HREF="http://www2010.ieee-scam.org/">http://www2010.ieee-scam.org/</A>

Sponsored by IEEE CS (pending)
In cooperation with:
- Semantic Designs Inc., Austin, TX, USA
- Univ. &quot;Politehnica&quot; Timisoara, Romania
- Centre for Research in Evolution, Search and Testing (CREST), King's College London, UK

----------------
Conference aims:
----------------
The aim of this working conference is to bring together researchers and
practitioners working on theory, techniques and applications which
concern analysis and/or manipulation of the source code of computer
systems. While much attention in the wider software engineering

community is properly directed towards other aspects of systems
development and evolution, such as specification, design and
requirements engineering, it is the source code that contains the only
precise description of the behaviour of the system. The analysis and

manipulation of source code thus remains a pressing concern.

---------
Keynotes:
---------
This year SCAM will feature two outstanding keynotes:
- Mark Harman, King's College London, UK
- Andreas Zeller, Saarland University, Germany

---------------------------------
Covered topics and paper formats:
---------------------------------
We welcome submission of papers that describe original and significant
work in the field of source code analysis and manipulation. Topics of
interest include, but are not limited to:

    * program transformation
    * abstract interpretation
    * program slicing
    * source level software metrics
    * decompilation
    * source level testing and verification
    * source level optimization
    * program comprehension

Note that SCAM explicitly solicits results from any theoretical or
technological domain that can be applied to these and similar topics.

Submitted papers should not be longer than 10 pages. We also welcome
submission of 2 page proposals for tool demonstrations expected to be
performed live at the conference. All papers submitted should follow
IEEE Computer Society Press Proceedings Author Guidelines. The

papers should be submitted electronically via the conference web site.
Submitted papers should not have been previously published, and should
not have been concurrently submitted elsewhere.

------------
Proceedings:
------------
All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings which will be
published by the IEEE Computer Society Press.

--------------
Special Issue:
--------------
Best papers from SCAM 2010 will be considered for revision, extension,
and publication in a special issue of the Science of Computer
Programming journal edited by Elsevier.

----------------
Important Dates:
----------------
Deadline for submission:
    Abstract due: 23rd April, 2010
    Full paper due: 30 April, 2010
Notification: 7th June, 2010
Working Conference: 12th-13th September 2010

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>
&gt;<i> Just one more comment on this Bug. It is ** clearly ** a bug, since
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR does work correctly when BitSets are NOT used. 
</I>
Well, it could be just a limitation, perhaps catered for with a few tweaks, or perhaps better addressed with efforts in the Antlr 3 space.

&gt;<i>I find it strange
</I>&gt;<i> that this Bug  seems to be passed in almost silence: I would think it to
</I>&gt;<i> be rather serious to have a &quot;sleeping&quot; bug that may come and bite you
</I>&gt;<i> any time you encounter the right conditions.
</I>
&gt;<i> Terrence asked me to try to produce a small grammar example to try to
</I>&gt;<i> reproduce the problem. I will as soon as time on my project permits it.
</I>
Hmmm - I thought you said it was a serious bug? Can't be THAT serious can it? ;-) 

&gt;<i> BUT I would think it is equally IMPORTANT for the ANTLR team to try to
</I>&gt;<i> hunt down this ** serious ** bug. It is nice that ANTLR 3.0 is under
</I>&gt;<i> development, but we sure need a strong ** core ** technology that won't
</I>&gt;<i> fail.
</I>
Well, the last time I was there I noticed that beer and pizza were significantly more expensive in San Francsico than most other parts of the world except Geneva. I am sure that donating a few vouchers for same would make this bug very much more important. Remember that it is free (for you anyway) and we should be careful to give out a bit of respect for people's time and efforts given freely :-).

Jim

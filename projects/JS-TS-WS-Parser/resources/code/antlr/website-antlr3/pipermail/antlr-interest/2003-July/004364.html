<PRE>That's just a biased summary (no bad vibes meant - of course it's biased
- it's by a participant in the dispute :-)

But where is the reference that bans them?

As I understand it, there are no restrictions saying they can't be
Java-compatible - at any version! They're just not allowed to abuse the
Java trademark by claiming that MS code will run on a Sun/Blackdown/IBM
JVM if it won't.

Should they care to implement the JDK1.2 interface then (a) there is
nothing to stop them, and (b) there is nothing to stop them saying &quot;J#
will run Java 1.2 code&quot;. What they *cannot* do is call the resulting J#
&quot;Java&quot; because J# won't run on a Java 1.2 JVM.

Cheers,
Wol

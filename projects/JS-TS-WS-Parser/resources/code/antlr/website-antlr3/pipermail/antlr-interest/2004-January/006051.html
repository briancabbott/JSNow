<PRE>Hey Karl,

If you are looking at performance issues one item you might look at is
how often are you using the tree parser?

The tree parser in the general nature of how it works (i.e. walking a
linked list of tree nodes) is a major performance killer. This is due to
the problem of the next node not being in the CPU's data cache thus
requiring a trip to main memory for the data. 

In my component I was initially using the tree parser to do a lot of my
runtime operations and was facing major performance issues. I changed my
application (which is in C#) to generate a runtime class to handle the
operations with major performance improvements.

Don't know if this helps you but I figured I'd mention it.

-Richard

The Three Laws of Infernal Dynamics:
1. An object in motion will always be headed in the wrong direction.
2. An object at rest will always be in the wrong place.
3. The energy required to change either of these states will always be
more than you wish to expend, but never so much as to make the task
appear prospectively impossible.

&gt;<i> &gt; But fine, I used returned values in my rules all the time too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The traditional alternatives to a return value are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) reference parameters
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They don't work for primitives in Java unfortunately.

Of couse.

ResultInfo would be a object.

whew! 
did not mean to start a flame war. 

btw Terr,  I like antlr a lot.  Thanks. 
I am using it in product that is close to shipping.
So I am starting to think about speedups. 

Good luck 

Karl

<PRE>&gt;<i> As far as I recall, Prashant never said it would be free. The &quot;video-only&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> previews were just to demonstrate what he was doing and gauge interest. 
</I>This was the impression letted to me and to many others I talked to.


&gt;<i> RE &quot;testing a commercial product&quot;, have you never heard of public betas?
</I>&gt;<i> Many many many commercial products have public betas, and some even ask that
</I>&gt;<i> you pay to participate (the M$ office betas, for example).
</I>Who said thy can serve as a model. They have a monopol situation and can impose everything,
and who has enough free time might will play with.

&gt;<i> Absolutely nothing wrong with this, so please chill...
</I>Just because it's legal, it doesn't mean it's moral or fair. Don't get me wrong, I'm talking
about M$ :). I really dislike this kind of 'tactics' also when others try to copy them :).

&gt;<i> Prashant has chatted with me about price possibilities, and he's looking to
</I>&gt;<i> keep it inexpensive. 
</I>Well, than this explains why you don't have the impression that it would be free :).
Everyone else thought this.

&gt;<i> I told him it's a very niche market and that he may not
</I>&gt;<i> sell many unless the price is very low, and even then he probably wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> sell many.
</I>I also told him this when he made the annoucement on his blog.

&gt;<i> I think you should view it more as a &quot;payware&quot; tool than a commercial
</I>&gt;<i> product (as he's not doing this as a business).
</I>On his blog he stated exactly the contrary.

Ahmed.

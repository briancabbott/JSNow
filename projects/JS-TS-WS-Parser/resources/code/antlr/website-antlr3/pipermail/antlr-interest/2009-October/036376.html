<PRE>I wouldn't want to get in the way of a good pity party but my experience 
has been the opposite.

I'm new to antlr, purchased the book, downloaded free software and got 
my project working in record time (for me).

I had help along the way and have watched others get helpful responses 
to their questions.

I wonder what are your expectations from a user mailing list?  It's 
really not customer support of a commercial product or free consulting 
services on your project.  It's a community of people with a common 
interest. 

May I suggest simple well formed questions that people can answer 
quickly from experience rather than ones that take a lot of work to 
understand. If the question is something like here's a 3 line grammar 
that doesn't work with this input, I've seen very good answers come 
quickly.  I've also seen questions like (OK this is hyperbole) I'm 
trying to translate Japanese into Sanskrit, attached is my grammar file 
it's only 80MB,  for some reason the past perfect tense is getting into 
an infinite loop, please help.

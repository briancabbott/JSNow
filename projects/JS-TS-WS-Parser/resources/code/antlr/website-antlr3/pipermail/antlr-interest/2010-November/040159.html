Which other workarounds are there?  Can you give me some pointers?

Does this mean that there is no simple solution with ANTLR?

I played around with it some more and noticed that my lexer rules
are actually just regular expressions.  This is probably the usual
case for lexers.  So I just threw my problem at gnu sed and
it solves my tokenization problem perfectly:

command: sed 's/\(a\+\( \+a\+\)*\| \|=\)/[\1]/g'
input: a aa = aa
output: [a aa][ ][=][ ][aa]

Granted, the syntax is ugly and I would have to somehow put this into
code. But it gave me the idea of creating a simple preprocessor
that frames the identifiers with \u0002 and \u0003, such that
ANTLR recognizes them without problem.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> where ID is whatever you allow in an identifier between spaces. Then during the semantic analysis wherever you find an id_sequence in effect treat the first ID as a function that takes the rest of the id_sequence as an argument returning an &quot;identifier&quot;. This analysis can be performed recursively fore each ID in the sequence. The implementation is straightforward, but tedious, and of course left to the student.
</I>
Actually the spaces are part of the identifier and are significant.
That means I would have to know how many identifiers were between the
two IDs of an id_sequence.  I saw somebody mention that you could
somehow access the hidden channel used to ignore spaces but I did
not find any good explanation of how to do that.

<PRE>Two approaches that I think are the most effective are pre-processing and
substitution in the lexer. You could also do it in the parser (see &quot;handling
include files&quot; FAQ), although it makes your AST/walker more complicated.
The advantage of pre-processing is the flexibility of having macros anywhere
in the code, even as parts of tokens. A disadvantage is that you have to
keep track of all macro replacements and then do some post-processing on all
line and character numbers to be able to report correct numbers for the
original file. Also, you have to pass through the file twice.

Doing the replacement in the lexer is probably the most effective solution
for the majority of the cases. As long as your macros are not allowed to
define parts of tokens (or you can modify your lexer to make it so), then
this is a pretty easy solution. Whenever you detect a macro, drop that
token, switch the input stream to the macro value, and then switch back when
it's done. You'll need to detect macro definitions and keep a map of them,
of course.

&gt;<i> Hi,

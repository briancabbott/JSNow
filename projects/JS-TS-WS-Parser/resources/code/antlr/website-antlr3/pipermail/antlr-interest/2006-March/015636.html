I had intended to send this reply in response to the switch/interface
post.

In my studies I came across something that said &quot;only 50% progress from
concrete to abstract thought&quot;. Okay, I guess most of us here are in the
50% that have progressed.

But a switch statement is a far more concrete construct than an
interface. I'm fine with metadata, but I find Antlr pushing me into
realms I have problems with.

I guess what I'm trying to say is &quot;Antlr is a complex tool. Some of its
advanced techniques may be beyond the ability of some people to
comprehend&quot;. It's in that context that the ability to provide a concrete
model for the weaker members to get their brain round is worth its
weight in gold.

Cheers,
Wol

Subject: RE: [antlr-interest] Article against TreeWalkers

One thing that really helped me get my first tree walker &quot;out the door&quot;
was to use the AST frame. Helps to visualize the second dimension.
 
            ASTFrame frame = new ASTFrame(&quot;AST&quot;, tree.getAST());
            frame.setVisible(true);

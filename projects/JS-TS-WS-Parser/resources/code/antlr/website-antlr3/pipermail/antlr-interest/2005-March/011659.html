&gt;<i> 1) Some possible uses of Antlr are not compilers but interactive
</I>&gt;<i> applications. High performance applications may need to parse distinct
</I>&gt;<i> texts a LOT(!)  of times (for instance the query parser for a search
</I>&gt;<i> engine). For such applications concurrency and reuse of objects can be
</I>&gt;<i> very important. Currently, ANTLR parsers are not multi-thread safe and
</I>&gt;<i> object reuse is hard to do (not explicitly supported). Generation of
</I>&gt;<i> reusable MT-safe parsers/lexers would be a great (optional) feature.
</I>
The notion has been that you can instantiate as many instances of your
lexer/parser/walker that you want to get the concurrency that you desire.


&gt;<i> 2) Some classes like antlr.Parser and antlr.CharScanner use inefficient
</I>&gt;<i> legacy java classes like tokenTypeToASTClassMap&#146;s HashTable) instead
</I>&gt;<i> of HashMap (unnecessary synchronization for a parser/scanner that is not
</I>&gt;<i> thread-safe anyway).
</I>
That will be easier to change in Antlr v3 both because of the rewrite as
well as the use of StringTemplates for the code generation.


&gt;<i> 3) The current API is targeted for large files but does not allow for
</I>&gt;<i> efficient parsing of small strings like &#147;x AND NOT (y AND z OR w)&#148;
</I>&gt;<i> compared to a hand-written parser. Antlr should generate a lexer with a
</I>&gt;<i> constructor that accepts a string (or even better a CharSequence) so that
</I>&gt;<i> the overhead of a StringReader can be avoided for such cases.
</I>
&gt;<i> 3) Antlr should try to limit the number of Strings that it generates or
</I>&gt;<i> forces the antlr-user to generate because of API limitations. In that
</I>&gt;<i> relation, for JDK 1.4+, CharSequence can sometimes used as a very fast
</I>&gt;<i> String replacement. (BTW: I did not find any uses of StringBuffer but for
</I>&gt;<i> JDK 1.5+ it should be replaced with StringBuilder).
</I>
Antlr v3 does a lot to improve efficiency in not generating excess
garbage, not copying data unnecessarily, and precision in touching e.g. LA
to make decisions.

Hope this helps,
		John

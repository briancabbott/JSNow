<PRE>The specs are publicly available for the LR grammar if you do a search on ECMA 
Script.  Richard Clark also sent an e-mail to the list mentioning that he was 
working on a project using the ECMAScript-262 grammar that he was going to 
release when he finished his project.

However, I have a mostly complete one from a long time ago that I haven't 
finished.  I did most of the LR-&gt;LL conversion and it now compiles, but there 
are quite a few warnings that I haven't yet had the time to look into (and it 
doesn't look like I will in the near future at all).  I would be willing to 
post the grammar, but as I mentioned its not complete.  It still lacks any 
AST building code.  But hey, if you have lots of Javascript files lying 
around, you could try it out and see what it parses.

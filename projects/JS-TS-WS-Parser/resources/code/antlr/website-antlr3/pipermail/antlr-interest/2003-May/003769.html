</I>Hi,
Thanks for that info. I have the Abstract Syntax Tree in memory and 
was wondering what the easiest way to extract the class and method 
information from this? Would it just be a case of calling getChild() 
and getNextSibling() recursively, and looking for class and method 
names? Alternatively, could I look though the string representation 
of the tree for all the class and method types?

Is there a set algorithm for going through all the nodes in an AST, 
as I'm having trouble getting my head round it! I don't think I have 
time to implement a tree parser, so I have to use getFirstChild() and 
getNextSibling() when walking the tree...
Any help would be greatly appreciated, (dissertation handin is very 
near!)
Jon

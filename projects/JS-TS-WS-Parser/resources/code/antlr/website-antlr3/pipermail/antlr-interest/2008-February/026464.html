<PRE>&gt;<i> I've learned that &quot;the customer is always right&quot; is good policy on bug
</I>&gt;<i> reports--not that he is right about the specifics, but that he is usually
</I>&gt;<i> right that &quot;there is a problem&quot;.
</I>
Wise

&gt;<i> As Guntis points out, in this case it is not the literals that are
</I>&gt;<i> the problem but the confusion arising from combined grammars which
</I>&gt;<i> hide the lexer.
</I>
I like antlr because of combined grammars, I think it is the right direction.

And I think that the root of the problem in this case
is antlrs broken lexer (please, forgive me again)

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; There isn't anything wrong with the tool, it is doing what you tell it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to do. The token isnt anonymous, it is called T66 or whatever,
</I>
I guess I should be thankful it is not called AK-47.
Is java.util.AbstractMap$2$1.class anonymous?

&gt;<i> &gt; runtime doesn't know that you created it by specifying it in the parser.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, I don't see why &quot;anonymous token&quot; would help you at all.
</I>
It would help me at design time to see I have a potential problem.
Not me, actually, I've already learned my lesson. It could help
others and could save many man-hours by clearly showing what is
going on.

&gt;<i> &gt; Criticism of the tool should be postponed until you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; truly understand what the tool is doing
</I>
By that time, I'll be a pro at avoiding traps and obstacles to the
point I will not notice them, so it will be too late to report anything.

BTW I think I understand what the tool is doing in this particular
case and I was not asking for help, was I? Adding
System.err.println(&quot;Anonymous token in parser rule: &quot; + lit);
to AssignTokenTypesWalker.assignStringTypes(Grammar) works well for me.

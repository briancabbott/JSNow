<PRE>Folks,

I have updated the download area with rc2 that has the updated 
documentation and so on.  I have not yet responded to a few problems 
reported by you folks, but I wanted to get the doc up and also to test 
my new build procedure.

I don't like having to download yet another tool just to build 
something (e.g., Ant or python).  Further, XML should not be used for 
human consumption (e.g., Ant).  What I want is a stupid build script 
that just compiles everything and then jar's it up.  When it only takes 
a few seconds to rebuild the whole 50k line program, why on earth would 
we bother with dependencies and other junk.  Problem is that scripts 
are not portable...Java is however.  So, I added a simple means for 
ANTLR to self-compile and build a jar.  package antlr/build has a 
simple Tool in it that lets me say:

java antlr.build.Tool build

This uses property antlr.build.root to figure out where the antlr dir 
associated with the antlr package resides.  It defaults to &quot;.&quot; (current 
directory).  You may also set the compiler as in:

java -Dantlr.build.compiler=jikes antlr.build.Tool build

I have tested this on win2k (cmd shell and bash from GNU) and Mac OS X.
Further, I have removed all of the build shell scripts and mkjar type
scripts I had since there is only one all encompassing antlr.jar now 
(450k) and a self-
build tool.  Main dir is now clear of my build stuff...just C++ and C# 
stuff in there now.

I'm assuming there will be an uproar over my introducing yet another 
build type thing, but having ANTLR build itself just makes sense and 
doesn't depend on anything else.

Oh, the build procedure ignores antlr/util package as I have stuff in 
there I'm not sure is ready for prime time and depends on my groovy 
StringTemplate stuff.  I'll probably just remove this for this release.

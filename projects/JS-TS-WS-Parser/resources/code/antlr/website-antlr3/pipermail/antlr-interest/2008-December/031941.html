You mis-understand - I didn't meant that Objective-C itself was in any
doubt - just that the Objective-C target for ANTLR was a little behind
and I am not clear if anyone is actively working on it at the
moment :-). Personally I don't think any language ever dies a death
really - there is always someone using it somewhere ;-)

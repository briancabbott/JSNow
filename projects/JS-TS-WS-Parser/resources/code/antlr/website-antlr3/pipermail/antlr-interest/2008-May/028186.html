</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure the book will (or should) answer this.  I am looking for a

There are example grammars for C# on the download page.

</I>&gt;<i> I am already able to generate lexing and parsing code for various

</I>&gt;<i> easy!  I got C# code, but I couldn't build it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I read a number of semi-mutually-contradictory-and-or-incomplete 
</I>&gt;<i> helpful hints on the wiki and by Googling.
</I>
Can you describe where you found not-as-helpful-information on the wiki, 
so I can fix it?
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That got me as far as adding a Reference to the Antlr3.Runtime -- huge 
</I>&gt;<i> step forward.
</I>
I'm not sure when which assemblies are required, but I always add 
Antlr.Runtime, Antlr.Utilities, antlr.runtime and Antlr.StringTemplate. 
With these you cover all bases.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then I ran into this mysterious RecognizerSharedState object in the C# 
</I>&gt;<i> target.  Uh oh.  I guess I'm still missing a Reference to a .NET 
</I>&gt;<i> Assembly, which probably means I skipped an important step, like 
</I>&gt;<i> building it.  I get a vague sense of this from some of the postings, but 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess I'm just dense. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any clues will be greatly appreciated.  I'll be happy to wait for the 
</I>&gt;<i> book to arrive, if it has the answer.  Please be blunt.  Insults can 
</I>&gt;<i> only make me smarter.  :)
</I>
My guess is that you are mixing code generation from ANTLR 3.1b1 with a 
library from 3.0.1. They aren't even source compatible. Please use the 
library and generation from the latest build - otherwise they may not 
work together.

Very difficult to formulate a one page/one paragraph answer.  After 
all, Antlr is a DSL tailored for a large, variable problem 
space.  The Antlr language operators are rather basic in nature -- to 
the extent there are coding patterns, they are quite general at best.

The step function learning problem is largely (I believe) one of 
learning how to design a recognition specification subject to the 
available mechanics of the Antlr language operators.  And, design in 
Antlr is largely a function of the language to be recognized.  If you 
look at the archived grammars, what at first appears to be wildly 
varying styles is more a consequence of design choices tailored to 
the intended function of the grammars.

That said, there are a number of caveats* that could be shared with 
those new to Antlr**:

1) if you need better documentation, write it as you learn***, get 
TDAR, or both.
2) Antlr lexers implement an LL(1) conversion of input symbols, 
typically atomic characters, into tokens.
3) Antlr parsers implement an LL(*) conversion of tokens to subrules, 
and then to actions or an AST.
4) The parser calls the lexer, but the lexer, on first call, will run 
to EOF.  After that, the lexer is just an in-memory sequential token 
repository for the parser.
5) Fragments are essentially macro expansions, and are only visible 
in the lexer.
6) Don't expect Antlr to resolve ambiguities automagically -- code 
what you mean.
7) Even where Antlr offers some incidental recognition behavior, use 
cautiously -- over reliance will result in inexplicable robustness 
and maintenance problems.
8) Left factor: understand it and use it.
9) Use groups (parenthesis delimited subrules) to make clear what 
your code means.
10) Use predicates to make clear what your code means.
11) Unless performance is absolutely your top 6 design requirements, 
don't worry about using predicates.
12) Don't try to do too much in the lexer.  The parser is more powerful anyway.
13) Don't try to do too much in the parser.  Use tree-walkers to evolve an AST.
14) Don't try to dump complex blocks from a parser or AST.  Use 
StringTemplate to unparse.
15) Actions (brace delimited statements) can be inserted almost anywhere.

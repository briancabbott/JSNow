Nope....it took me a while, but I found what I think is an email 
address; no name.  I emailed him last night and quickly looked at the 
source code.  I too verified that he had not just copied the source 
except for some smaller files.

Great! :)  Let's see if he likes the LL-regular.  I wonder who he is.  
The code showed a nontrivial understanding of the area.

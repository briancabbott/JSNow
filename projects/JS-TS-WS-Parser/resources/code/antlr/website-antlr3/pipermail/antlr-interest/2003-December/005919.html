OK, there's a little confusion with the term I used to refer the
java-generated class (I didn't mean binary-compiled... sorry). This
crash isn't related with gcj, and again, I'm not sure if this is only
present in the 2.7.3 test-version or is just because I did something
wrong in my environment configuration or build process (which was
adapted from the cygwin-working recipe).

&gt;<i> &gt; - The link to the latest Klaren's snapshot is broken. Due a typo (I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assume) it actually links to the previous one. Here is the correct one

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is no problem generating the static library with this version in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MSVC 6.0/SP5
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry about that :( I must have forgotten to update the link itself.
</I>Fixed
&gt;<i> it just now. Glad to hear that MSVC6 static build works now. DLL I
</I>wouldn't
&gt;<i> try on MSVC6 (but i'm told it can be done with STLport and some hacking)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Did this last snapshot work well with cygwin/mingw ?
</I>
So far, the snapshot was built under cygwin/mingw/j2sdk1.4.2_03 (with
a little variation from the cygwin-work-recipe), and it successfully
generated a the calc-cpp example, which I only successfully checked in
MSVC (and then, I went to sleep :)  ). As I said before, this
antl.Tool only crashes if it is called with no *.g as argument.

Regards.

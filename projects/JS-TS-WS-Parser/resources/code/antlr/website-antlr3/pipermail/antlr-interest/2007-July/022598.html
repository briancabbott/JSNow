Yeah, I meant v3.
I have had a comment in the ObjC target stating that we do not have  
lexer rule returns.
So I guess they got axed at some point in time.

At what points are you having return values? protected (=fragment)  
rules?
For &quot;normal&quot; lexer rules that produce tokens return values don't much  
sense, or
am I missing something? Where would the last return value go, as the  
lexer rules
are called from nextToken() and thus are not accessible to anyone,  
really.
Or are you calling the lexer rules directly for some reason?

cheers,

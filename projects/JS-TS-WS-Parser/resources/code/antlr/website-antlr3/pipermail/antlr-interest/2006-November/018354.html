<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; There is an interface between a Parser and a Lexer. The Lexer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; produces a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; stream of Tokens which the Parser consumes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Exactly. The question now is, what is that interface? Is it 
</I>&gt;<i> the set of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;lexer rules? Or is it the set of token types?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Apparently the set of rules is the same as the set of token types.
</I>
No. Token types may be defined in a tokens{..} block without an associated
rule.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; And of what type should these lexer produced Tokens be?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;The set is defined by the terminal symbols of the language.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. and as we have both pointed out to each other, lexical 
</I>&gt;<i> fragments do not represent terminal symbols of the language.
</I>
Not quite. They just do not [normally] emit tokens. I'd have to double-check
again if that can be overridded with action code.

&gt;<i> &gt;To actually prevent a grammar author to use that token type is much 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;more involved. It means you either have to change the way fragment 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;rules are represented internally, or you have to check all 
</I>&gt;<i> actions to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;catch any attempt to change a token's type to a forbidden 
</I>&gt;<i> value. That 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;sounds too difficult and I'd call that problematic. It'd be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;bound to be a fragile implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I envisioned that the code that handles token references in 
</I>&gt;<i> parser rules would do the check. not any code in lexer rules 
</I>&gt;<i> that sets the token type.
</I>
Parsers [quite rightly] know nothing about lexer rules or fragments. They
just expect a stream of tokens (with token types from their token type
vocabulary).

&gt;<i> The file produce by the lexer generation code containing the 
</I>&gt;<i> assigned token types (is it the *.tokens file?) would need to 
</I>&gt;<i> include an additional flag for each token type to indicate 
</I>&gt;<i> whether or that token type was induced by a lexical fragment 
</I>&gt;<i> (or maybe just not write fragment token types to that file in 
</I>&gt;<i> the first place?) the parser generation code would then use 
</I>&gt;<i> that flag to perform the error check.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am sure I have oversimplified this checking. Not sure how 
</I>&gt;<i> the handling of a tokens{} section would impact this checking.
</I>
Interesting idea. While it certainly could be done, I can't help feeling
that this is really a training issue.

My reasoning?. Well:
- there are legitimate reasons for sending tokens types named after a
fragment rule to the parser as Kay pointed out.
- the option exists to name fragment rules (and their auto-generated token
type namesake) such that it is impossible to misuse unintentionally [e.g.
DIGIT_NotForParser, DoNotUseInParser_DIGIT, LexerInternal_DIGIT]

&gt;<i> &gt;I have a hard time to believe that this is a real-world scenario.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have helped new users to resolve this on at least 2 
</I>&gt;<i> occasions. Most recently just this past Sunday immediately 
</I>&gt;<i> before I started this thread.
</I>
As I said, this sounds like a training issue.

<PRE>With reference to <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">Pandeyrajiv at yahoo.com</A> question of Monday 10
November (in antlr-interest Digest Number 1486),

I assume you were referring to the C++ grammar supplied by me
from London South Bank University.

As far as I know there is no other C++ grammar available and I
regret that this grammar does not yet provide an AST. (Please
note that as it stands this particular version uses ANTLR
(Java) to generate C++ parsers written in C++ only).

I am still working on this grammar and do not have time (or
the need) to generate an AST. However, I don't think this too
difficult and if you decide to try to do this I would be
pleased to hear about it so I could update my version
appropriately.

On the other hand Dmitry Poplavsky (<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">dima at thekompany.com</A>) has
expressed an interest in the grammar and asked about an AST.
Perhaps he may be persuaded to do this for us.

I believe there are examples of grammars with ASTs in the
examples directory.

David.

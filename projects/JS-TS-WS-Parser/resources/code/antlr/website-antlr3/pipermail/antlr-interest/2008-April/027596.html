<PRE>Gerald--

I don't have this problem with Yggdrasil:  rewrites occur through !/^ annotations, attribute assignments and attribute instantiations in the output tree; nodes are created with a factory according to token type using the ANTLR 2 type mapping syntax which occurs only in the tokens {} section.

I guess it may take more effort with the baseline ANTLR 3 than I had thought.

Subject: Re: [antlr-interest] Every grammar an output grammar

Nice!  Couple of possible issues, though:

First, the proposed annotation syntax appears to conflict (at least 
in syntax presentation) with the heterogeneous AST production 
syntax.  Even though the example shown only uses lhs annotation, 
annotations in the rewrite production would likely be as or more 
useful.  On the rhs, the conflict with heteroAST would be direct.

Second, any chance to not further overload the &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; 
symbols?  I realize there is a certain parallel to the template 
definition syntax, but these are really grammar-based selectors and 
values, so bringing in template definition syntax just feels a bit 
odd.  Perhaps a simplified anchor/parameter syntax?

rule#ruleref : (DOC_COMMENT)? (RULE_REF#name | TOKEN_REF#name) ;

sends &quot;name&quot; values to &quot;ruleref&quot; template, skipping any output for 
DOC_COMMENT -- leaving no attribute produced by default might be more 
desirable if only go keep the grammar as lean and literate as possible.

or

rule#ruleref : (DOC_COMMENT)? (ref=RULE_REF | ref=TOKEN_REF)  -&gt; 
^(RULE&lt;RuleNode&gt; $ref#name ^(SRC&lt;SourceNode&gt; $rule#content)) ;

My $0.02 ...

Best,
Gerald

</I>&gt;<i>       line separators like other whitespace characters, and my grammar

</I>&gt;<i>       tokens on the hidden channel, and then optionally reveal them
</I>&gt;<i>       only in the few rules that require it?
</I>&gt;<i>    2. The grammar doesn't include any ^ or ! modifiers to impose any
</I>&gt;<i>       kind of useful structure to the generated AST. I can see how I
</I>&gt;<i>       ought to do this in the simple cases (e.g. 'return'^
</I>&gt;<i>       expression), but I'm not sure how far I ought to go with this
</I>&gt;<i>       before relying on a subsequent tree grammar to finish the job.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't performed much in the way of formal testing, except that it

</I>Virtual semicolons is a hard concept. In a different environment (not 
antlr) I had a concept of token pairs. If a line feed occurred between 
certain token pairs, for instance two identifiers, then I replaced the 
line feed by a virtual semicolon. This means that you have to track the 
last two tokens.
There are two types of cases that need special treatment.
    1) Control statements, like break, return etc, if not followed by an 
expression on the same line, alway have the linefeed turned into a 
virtual semicolon.
    2) Right paren followed by any token that could start an expression 
will generate a virtual semicolon so the parser will need to accept 
virtual semicolons as whitespace for &quot;for&quot;, &quot;while&quot;, and &quot;if&quot; statements.

I can discuss details with you off -line if you need further guidance.

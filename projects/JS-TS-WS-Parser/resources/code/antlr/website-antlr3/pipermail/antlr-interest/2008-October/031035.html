I surely hope that as part of your conversion you turn those into 
PreparedStatement instances!


&gt;<i> There is already a tool that does this that it's provided by Oracle,

</I>&gt;<i> on other files (macros and such) that are used  for the business
</I>&gt;<i> logic in the dynamic sql, so the compiler would have to link the
</I>&gt;<i> files and do semantic checking. Is this feasible? The approach we
</I>&gt;<i> have right now is using a custom framework with match and replace

I have not actually used this feature, but JetBrains (formerly 
IntellifJ) IDEA has something called &quot;structural search and replace&quot; 
which may do what you need. I suggest you search on their site for that 
feature and, perhaps, ask in the IntelliJ IDEA Community Forum whether 
this can be done:

- IntelliJ IDEA Forums
  &lt;<A HREF="http://www.intellij.net/forums/category.jspa?categoryID=8">http://www.intellij.net/forums/category.jspa?categoryID=8</A>&gt;

- IDEA Community Forum (general questions)
  &lt;<A HREF="http://www.intellij.net/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=27">http://www.intellij.net/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=27</A>&gt;


I know IDEA isn't cheap, but my guess it buying, installing and learning 
to use it enough for this task would be cheaper than the cost an 
engineer's time required to create a purpose-built solution.

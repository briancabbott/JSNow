This has not been changed in the upcoming b5.

The key point to see here is that the parser does not &quot;call&quot; a lexer  
rule!
It merely reads from a token stream that is calling nextToken() in  
the lexer.
In which way the lexer ends up with a token to return is unspecified  
and this is a GoodThing(tm).
It means that you could use a lexer with a different internal  
structure (say different
rules) or even a non-ANTLR generated lexer. You could write a simple  
wrapper around flex
or hand-code a lexer, if you have special needs, such as performance.

So, even if it might look as the parser is calling rule X in the  
lexer class, it's not!
The parser isn't concerned with the lexer rules at all, it's just  
interested in the type
of a particular token (which is also called X). Maybe this  
overlapping of terminology
is the source of the confusion.

A rule X implies the token it returns to have the type X, but that is  
not enforced at all.
In the general case it's the exception to return a token with a  
different type, but sometimes
it's the easiest way out (like in lexing number literals).
I think it would be unnatural to forbid the use of token types  
induced by fragment rules,
there's no need to do that either.

When I stretch my mind a bit, I can even imagine that I'd actually  
want to emit tokens for
fragment rules. Although I realize that I might totally confuse the  
issue at hand right now, I
cannot refrain from writing this down ;)
Ok, what am I thinking?
Conside the following rules in the lexer:

FOO
   : start=ID c=C end=ID
	{ emit(FOO); emit(start); emit(c); emit(end); } // this is  
pseudocode, but i think you get what i mean
   ;	
fragment C : '0x01223'; // some magic thing that should not be normal  
token.
fragment ID : 'a'..'z' ('a'..'z'|'0'..'9')*;

Suppose you have built a lexer subclass that can emit multiple tokens  
for one lexer rule (ANTLR
by default emits a maximum of one token per lexer rule).
In the parser you'd like to receive multiple tokens when you  
reference FOO. You could write:

somerule : FOO ID C ID	; // FOO generates ID C ID even though the  
rules are fragments!

what have you won? you might get around fiddling with the token's  
text's in the parser, you could
possibly set up a finer control of token channels, etc.
This might be a bad idea, but is interesting nonetheless. ;)

I need coffee. Quick.

cheers,
-k

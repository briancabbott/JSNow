<PRE>Yep - that's all cool Andreas. I just wanted to sound those notes of caution.

Personally I think NetBeans is infinitely better crafted and easier to
use than Eclipse. The dominance of the latter is a good example of
market lock-in :)

The nice NB update module mechanism for an ANTLRWorks app would
certainly be appreciated by users.

</I>&gt;<i> Just my opinion. Awesome work, Ter, you and Sam are moving going fast!

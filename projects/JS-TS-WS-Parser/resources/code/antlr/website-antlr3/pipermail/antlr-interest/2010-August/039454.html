Hello,

I want to write an ANTLR-Lexer and -Parser for a Literate Programming
language. The idea is to embed code fragments in various languages in a
LaTeX document and generate source files on-the-fly.

The languages allows to change the special character used to denote the
beginning of a code snippet and the special character used inside these
snippets to denote inclusion of other snippets. This is needed because
some &quot;guest&quot;-languages might need a pre-defined special character
themselves.

The special character can be changed anywhere in the source text by
using &lt;OLDSPECIAL&gt;=&lt;NEWSPECIAL&gt; where &lt;OLDSPACIAL&gt; is the old special
character and &lt;NEWSPECIAL&gt; is the new special character that should be
active after that instruction.

My idea was to modify the lexer such that it has a member variable &quot;char
cur_special&quot; that is set to the current special character and match
against it in a rule

&quot;fragment SCHAR : cur_special&quot;

such that the token stream abstracts from the different possible special
characters.

At the moment, the only way I see to accomplish this is to manually
modify the generated lexer in many places.

Is there perhaps a built-in functionality in ANTLR 3.2 i could use? I
couldn't find anything in the archives searching for &quot;lexer match
member&quot;. I really don't need a full how-to but a gentle nudge in the
correct direction.

Thanks in advance
Frederic

P.S.
Sorry if this is/becomes a repost. My first mail didn't make it through
- - perhaps because it had a PGP signature attachment

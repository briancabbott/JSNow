<PRE>Hi!

This is a statement of opinion, not truth. Like my statement was one  
of opinion, not truth.

And I see the value in that, don't get me wrong. IIRC Pascal has  
something similar (the index set could be of some specific type, if my  
memory doesn't fail me). OTOH many languages don't have it and that's  
for a reason as well.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;For the reason given above, I think ANTLR should not change its  
</I>&gt;<i> behavior at this point.
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR has already changed... ANTLR v2 column/line is (1,1) based...   
</I>&gt;<i> (so think about all people moving their grammar from V2 to V3...) So  
</I>&gt;<i> I would like ANTLR v3 to use also the (1,1) coordinate...
</I>

So many things changed from v2 to v3 (syntax, capabilities, runtime  
library API). And this changed, too, we've had a final release and  
number of beta releases so far, so I think it should not change back  
all of a sudden, especially given that it is so simple to change back  
to 1 in user code (and quite frankly that's probably just a couple of  
lines to write once).

I think we should put this to rest, unless Ter wants to chime in and  
make a decision.

cheers,
-k

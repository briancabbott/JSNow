<PRE>&gt;<i> Actually, alt 2 is the exit branch for a single alt (...)* loop so
</I>&gt;<i> it's essentially saying it won't ever exit upon '+'. :)
</I>

I'm not sure I understand that... If I comment out the 'D' a alt from rule
c,  ANTLR stops complaining, but the generated code for rule a is the same
as when I leave it in. Regardless, isn't this true of even the simplest
(...)*, I mean, the fact that it won't exit upon matching what's between the
parenthesis (i.e., it has to keep looping)?

&gt;<i> On a related note, any idea why antlr complains with &quot;2:16: The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; following alternatives are unreachable: 2&quot; for the following
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grammar? A bug, maybe?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grammar T;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a    :  'x' ('+' a)? ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For one, ANTLR must complain that there is no rule obviously followed
</I>&gt;<i> by EOF.  In this case, though, I think it's saying that there is no
</I>&gt;<i> input that will predict bypassing the (...)?, which of course there
</I>&gt;<i> isn't due to lack of start rule.  It should become ('+' a) in the
</I>&gt;<i> output and probably never terminate. :)
</I>

Yup, that's exactly what's happening. If I add a parent rule that simply
calls rule a, it starts working. Cool! :)

Thanks!

Martin

<PRE>Hello everyone!

This is still an ideea for translators/compilers area:

While I was trying to finish a preliminary version of
a translator from Lua to Java (about 2 weeks ago),
because Lua is a fairly simple procedural language
(most of it, excluding closures...) I had an ideea
about how to make a lexer and a parser for what I've
called Common Procedural Language Subset; basically,
this is comprised (in my mind, for now :)) in 2
grammars, one for the lexer and one for the parser for
some basic/common constructions used is most
programming languages, that can be inherited and hence
extended.... I mean, all languages (or most of them)
have some form of assignment (whether it is plain '=',
or set-q, or something else, anyway I'd go with '=',
because I thought the susbset for procedural
languages...); also most of the languages have a long
form of comment and a short one, and the mechanism for
matching them is the same, only the delimiters differ
(maybe it would be nice a way to set them and to get
the grammar as output... :)) (I guess you all know
what I'm talking about); also most identifiers start
with _ or letter and continue with _, letter and
digit... AND SO ON....

The ideea is to catch all these patterns in procedural
languages and to make something to start upon...

I didn't read the other replies on this topic and if I
had the same idea as anyone else, but later, I do
appologise for repeating...

Anyway, I don't claim this ideea :))
Respect, Tavi.

Hi Kay,

      The RecognitionException does require the token to be passed as
argument. But there is no method as to get the token, just as we have
getColumn() and getLine() methods on RecognitionException object.



      Its ok I may extract it from localized message of
RecognitionException.



Thank you.



Abhijit.

For ANTLR v2 I don't think the token is stored in the exceptions,
unfortunately. You might have to extract it manually.

In v3 the token itself is passed to the exception making the whole thing
a lot easier.

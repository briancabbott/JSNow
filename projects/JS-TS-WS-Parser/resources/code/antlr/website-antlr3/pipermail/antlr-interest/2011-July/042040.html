<PRE>Dear Friends-

 

I am attempting to define a language that will let me parse knitting
instructions.  (Don't ask.)

 

By and large it is a well understood convention with standard abbreviations
and phrases.  Occasionally the originator will insert a phrase in the
instructions that are not directly relevant.  What I would like is to parse
out those words and deal with them around the issue of reading the
instructions.  I have tried:

 

text :    (letter)+;

letter :  ('a'..'z' | 'A'..'Z');

WS   :    (' ' | '\n' | '\r');

 

And it doesn't work at all.  I changed it to:

 

text :   (letter)+;

letter :~('&quot;' | '\\');

WS   :   (' ' | '\n' | '\r');


That works, but becomes unweildy very quickly when I start including all of
the things I do know to scan for. I have attached the KnittingGrammer.g file
with my rules.

For example:

&quot;1st Section: Cast on 63 stitches (sts) and work in pattern as follows:&quot; is
parsed into '1st Section:' and 'Cast on 63 stitches (sts)' which leaves the
text until the colon which is the stop character.  I would like to parse the
'and work in pattern as follows' into the parse tree under text so I can
inspect it or lex it seperately or even display to the user.

What am I missing or doing wrong?

My thanks for your help in advance.

Regards,

Chris

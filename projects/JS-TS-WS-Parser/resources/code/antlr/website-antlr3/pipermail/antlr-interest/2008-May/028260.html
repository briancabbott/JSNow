I'm not sure how useful that would be.  Generally the debug 
interfaces are only consumed by ANTLRworks, and the driver for 
doing debugging work will generally look completely different from 
the driver for doing &quot;real&quot; work.  I guess it would mean you 
wouldn't have to write a little throwaway program to do the 
debugging with, but I don't think that's a big hardship.  I'd 
rather not have the non-debug interfaces get cluttered up.

 &gt;and using LINQ if I find places were this is sensible.

AFAIK, you can't use LINQ without forcing .NET 3.5 as a 
requirement, which seems like too much of a jump.

 &gt;I had the inspiration that the only difference between .NET 2 
and
 &gt;.NET 3.5 is that .NET 3.5 has some additional libraries and
 &gt;programs targetted for .NET 3.5 can work on .NET 2, if they 
ignore
 &gt;the additional capabilities.

Which you're not doing, if you use LINQ.  It's safe to use new 
features of the *compiler* (eg. lambdas, 'var's, and I think 
extension methods as well); that will retain 2.0 
compatibility.  But LINQ requires library support.

<PRE>A grammar that does type checking would be helpful, as would one that does
better than average error messages.  They could be the same grammar.  In
fact they could be extensions to the gcc grammar &lt;wink&gt;.  C is just a bit
hairier than Java in the type department so is more interesting.

Hi Jim (and others that responded).

Sounds like Monty has offered to &quot;manage&quot; the IDE project prototype 
this Fall and he makes the most sense I'd say.  I might be doing 
another project next semester though ;)

Also, I'm going to see if I can get students to build grammars.  Can 
people suggest grammars they want built?  They might have to describe 
it to the students. ;)

I'm also going to ask a studnet to help finish the antlr.org site. :)

</I>&gt;<i> Howdy.  I am teaching a master's project class at USF this semester 
</I>&gt;<i> and am going to offer to direct a project involving ANTLR.  Can people 
</I>&gt;<i> suggest a bite-size semester-long project that a group of students 
</I>&gt;<i> could do?  I'm thinking that Loring Craymer will suggest a start on 
</I>&gt;<i> the ANTLR IDE &quot;workbench&quot; that would display syntax diagrams from 
</I>&gt;<i> grammars and perhaps highlight grammar ambiguities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Beyond making a few project suggestions, does anybody out there want 
</I>&gt;<i> to help direct one of the projects?  It would be a loose confederation 
</I>&gt;<i> where you could be as involved as you want.  Anything from some 
</I>&gt;<i> initial phone conference calls (or showing up if you are around san 
</I>&gt;<i> francisco) to actually taking an active role in guiding a project.

some thoughts on this problem:

  1) I can't change the grammar -- if it's too ambiguous I'd have
to investigate other means of getting the information.

  2) as you pointed out a newline character isn't reliable in this
case (which for every rule that I can think of in my grammar it
usually is); 

  the problem with allowing or not-allowing tokens in the rule is 
the fact that it's a chat message generated by a human
so they can say pretty much anything they want; when I was playing
with Boost::Spirit our chat message rules essentially disallowed
any 'action' to appear as the first word after a 'r' or 'n'

  the actions themselves are no more than say 20 different keywords
so it's not a huge performance hit to look for them

  also I do have the current list of usernames allowed for these
actions before I start trying to figure out what action is what;
unfortunately since everything gets tokenized BEFORE that logic 
happens it doesn't really help me out

  as for looking at tokens at the beginning the general action
looks like this:

  username verb

our chat rule plays out like:

  username: verb

thankfully I haven't come across a username with a ':' in it yet
but usernames can contain spaces which also present a problem of having
trailing whitespace

Thanks for the help,

Ian

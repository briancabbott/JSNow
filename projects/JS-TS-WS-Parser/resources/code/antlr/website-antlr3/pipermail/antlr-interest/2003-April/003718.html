This holds true for flex and the like, yes. I was thinking of 
something like XSLT. You have a bunch of matching rules there having 
an XPATH expression that specifies the nodes they match. If you have 
two or more rules that match the same node the &quot;most specific&quot; is 
chosen. The ploblem with this approach is XPATH is a bit complicated 
and thus it is not always clear which expression is more specific...

It got lost in the configure/Makefile rework for 2.7.5. I posted an 
updated Makefile a little while ago though (based probably on the one 
mentioned).

You still need the java support library if you want to build from 
generated java files to native parser binaries. I don't think there's a 
Makefile floating around for that case. (It was also not supported in 
the Makefiles from 2.7.4) Basically just grab everything from the antlr 
directory except the swing stuff (the same as with building the native 
antlr binary) make a library of that and link it to the generated 
parser. Or if you use gcj as javac replacement you just have to make a 
jar file from the support lib (the default antlr Makefiles should be 
able to make that for you, then just point to it in the classpath or 
commandline)

&gt;&gt;<i> BTW - I had a go at an RPM installation, but gave up following
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dependency meltdown.
</I>
It often helps to build rebuild from the src.rpm if it's supplied. That 
usually fixes any distribution induced dependencies. (rpmbuild --rebuild 
&lt;the.src.rpm&gt;)

Cheers,

Ric

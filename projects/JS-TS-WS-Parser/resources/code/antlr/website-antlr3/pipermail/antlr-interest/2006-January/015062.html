<PRE>Sorry, meant to rename thread first time.  A major correction below:
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm relatively new to AntlrWorld, having (re)discovered it only a few 
</I>&gt;<i> weeks ago, and then discovered StringTemplate, which has since consumed 
</I>&gt;<i> most of my waking hours.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can't really follow the hairy details of this thread, but I think I 
</I>&gt;<i> see an abstract pattern.  Please tell me if the following makes sense:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The core issue is design strategy for language transformation.  If we 
</I>&gt;<i> can think of a continuum of design options, then (possibly) we can put 
</I>&gt;<i> the Antlr strategy on one end, and the (Jazillion?) on the other.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (I'm being very schematic here; perhaps the actual workings of antlr and 
</I>&gt;<i> jazillion don't fit the schema.  Please advise.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We can call the Antlr approach &quot;source-driven transformation&quot;; the 
</I>&gt;<i> Jazillion approach &quot;target-driven&quot; transformation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By &quot;source-driven&quot;, I mean that the process looks sth like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     a.  write grammar to parse source language
</I>&gt;<i>     b.  generate source AST
</I>&gt;<i>     c.  write (tree) transformation grammar that attaches actions to 
</I>&gt;<i> (AST) productions, producing either:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         c1.  a target AST that can then be run through other 
</I>&gt;<i> transformers, in particular a pretty-printer; or
</I>&gt;<i>         c2.  a text in the target language
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So in practice a source-driven strategy means writing code to feed into 
</I>&gt;<i> a parser generator.  The driver will invoke the parser on a source text. 
</I>&gt;<i>  Grammatical structure of the source text controls processing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By &quot;target-driven&quot; I mean a process that looks something like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     For each element in the target language,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         a.  write transformation logic mapping source elements to target 
</I>&gt;<i> element
</I>&gt;<i>         b.  write (or generate) a &quot;rule&quot;, which is a little parser to 
</I>&gt;<i> examine the source text for elements needed to generate said target 
</I>&gt;<i> element; attach transformations from (a) to production in the grammar
</I>
Clarification:  &quot;rule&quot; = *set* of parsers; attach transformations from 
(a) to these parsers.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In practice a target-driven strategy means writing a set of rules 
</I>&gt;<i> (functions) to be called in turn at each token in the source text.  I.e. 
</I>&gt;<i> Start with a target element and see if the corresponding source 
</I>&gt;<i> production(s) match(es); or, try to find the appropriate target element 
</I>&gt;<i> by testing various source productions.  Source language structure 
</I>&gt;<i> controls processing within the driver itself.
</I>
Major correction for last sentence above:  *Target* language structure 
controls processing...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The source-driven approach embeds target generation code in a source 
</I>&gt;<i> grammar; the target-driven approach embeds source-grammar in target 
</I>&gt;<i> generation code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that is somewhere in the ballpark; it's nice and clean so it 
</I>&gt;<i> would be a shame if it was also stupid.  ;)   I think I understand how 
</I>&gt;<i> antlr works pretty well, but I'm not sure about the Jazillion approach.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If this schema is accurate/useful, then I would suggest building on the 
</I>&gt;<i> paper &quot;Why I don't Use...&quot; to produce a more general consideration of 
</I>&gt;<i> the pros and cons of the respective approaches.  Something like 
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;Language Transformation Strategies: Source-Driven v. Target-Driven in 
</I>&gt;<i> a Fight to the Death!&quot;*  As it stands, the article is interesting 
</I>&gt;<i> (though a bit hard to follow for somebody like me, w/out lots of parsing 
</I>&gt;<i> experience), but it sometimes gives (me at least) the impression of 
</I>&gt;<i> saying &quot;my approach is better because, well, because I like it more&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i> That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I gather that in large part 
</I>&gt;<i> that's because you find the one approach fits better with the way you 
</I>&gt;<i> think about the problem, which doesn't imply that it is a &quot;better&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> approach.  I'd like to see a more dispassionate consideration of the 
</I>&gt;<i> pros and cons.  The &quot;mental model&quot; one needs for each strategy is 
</I>&gt;<i> obviously very important, but there are other considerations: 
</I>&gt;<i> efficiency, maintainability, etc. - the usual suspects.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And of course the overalln approach could be generalized, i.e. design an 
</I>&gt;<i> abstract uber-language (cf. IDL).  Then you can write one 
</I>&gt;<i> source-&gt;uberlang transformer per source lang, and one uberlang-&gt;target 
</I>&gt;<i> transformer per target language.  I suppose somebody already does this 
</I>&gt;<i> (or has decided it's impossible or impractical).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> gregg
</I>&gt;<i>

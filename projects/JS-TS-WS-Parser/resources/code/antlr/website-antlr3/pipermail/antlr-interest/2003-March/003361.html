<PRE>Yes, I fully agree.  Laziness was a poor choice of words.  Ter's much more
active now that he's teaching.  The future looks brighter than ever for
antlr.

&quot;Distraction&quot; may be a better description than &quot;laziness&quot;, as I'm 
sure Monty will agree:  ANTLR 2 was implemented hurriedly, and Ter was 
immediately thereafter very actively involved in getting first 
MageLang and then jGuru going. There are a few PCCTS features--like 
full LL(k) and semantic predicate hoisting--that didn't make it into 
ANTLR 2.  Ter has &quot;promised&quot; to make sure that they make it into ANTLR 
3.

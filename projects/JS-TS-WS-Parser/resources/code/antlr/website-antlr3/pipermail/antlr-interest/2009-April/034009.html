</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Ah yes, the island-grammar example doesn't show integration of the
ASTs. Options would be:
1) Use two lexers and a single parser. If you have your main lexer
import the tokenVocab of your sub-lexer and the parser import the
tokenVocab of the main lexer then you should be able to have a
combined token vocabulary. You could have the WITH_SYNTAX block emit
all the tokens of the sub-block using multiple emits, but it's
probably better to override next token and have it handle the
sub-lexer.
So you would have something like (untested):
@members {
  WithSyntaxLexer withSyntaxLexer = null;
  boolean inWithSyntaxBlock = false;
  void enterWithSyntaxBlock() {
      if ( withSyntaxLexer == null )
        withSyntaxLexer = new WithSyntaxLexer(input, state);
      inWithSyntaxBlock = true;
  }

  public Token nextToken() {
    while (true) {
      state.token = null;
      state.channel = Token.DEFAULT_CHANNEL;
      state.tokenStartCharIndex = input.index();
      state.tokenStartCharPositionInLine = input.getCharPositionInLine();
      state.tokenStartLine = input.getLine();
      state.text = null;
      if ( input.LA(1)==CharStream.EOF ) {
        return Token.EOF_TOKEN;
      }
      try {
        // CHANGES HERE
        if ( inWithSyntaxBlock ) {
          // Lex from withSyntaxLexer instead
          withSyntaxLexer.mTokens();
          if ( state.type == WITH_SYNTAX_END )
            inWithSyntaxBlock = false; // Switch back to main lexer
for next token
        } else
          mTokens();
        // END CHANGES
        if ( state.token==null ) {
          emit();
        }
        else if ( state.token==Token.SKIP_TOKEN ) {
          continue;
        }
        return state.token;
      }
      catch (NoViableAltException nva) {
        reportError(nva);
        recover(nva); // throw out current char and try again
      }
      catch (RecognitionException re) {
        reportError(re);
        // match() routine has already called recover()
      }
    }
  }
}
Where WITH_SYNTAX_END is the token for the final '}' in the with
syntax block. By sharing the input stream and state object the two
lexers should keep in step and it's just a matter of calling mTokens
from whichever lexer should be in control.

2) Have two lexers and two parsers. Here the main lexer would returns
a single token for the whole &quot;WITH SYNTAX { ... }&quot; block and then have
the parser invoke a new lexer\parser on the text of that token and
insert the resulting tree into the main tree. Assuming the end marker
of the block is easy enough to detect this shouldn't get too messy.
You will probably need to handle nested &quot;{...}&quot; blocks (if these are
allowed in the block) and the presence of '}' in strings and comments.
See the handling of action code blocks in the ANTLR grammar for an
example of this. The main rules are:
ACTION
	:	NESTED_ACTION ( '?' {$type = SEMPRED;} )?
	;

fragment
NESTED_ACTION :
	'{'
	(	options {greedy=false; k=3;}
	:	NESTED_ACTION
	|	SL_COMMENT
	|	ML_COMMENT
	|	ACTION_STRING_LITERAL
	|	ACTION_CHAR_LITERAL
	|	.
	)*
	'}'
   ;

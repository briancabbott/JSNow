<PRE>Remember, only tokens, not rules, can be made into a root.  So {#item =
#([groups, &quot;&quot;], #item);} makes no sense because &quot;groups&quot; is a rule.  ANTLR
isn't smart enough to know if the rule &quot;groups&quot; only returns a single token.
And I don't know because you didn't post the groups rule.  So more detail is
needed to help you.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Re: Putting this all into an AST

Both of those are working like a charm for me.  Now, i'm left with one
problem left, and then this is complete.

i have the following for an item:

item
:<i>
</I>   (name) =&gt;
      baseitem // baseitem starts with (name) always
   |
   groups DOT! baseitem
   ;

Is there a way to plug an empty group into the first alternative, and
use a [group, &quot;&quot;] as the root of a #(group baseitem) tree which will
be the form for both of these?  Or a #([ITEM, &quot;item&quot;] group baseitem)
tree, which might be the better way -- although i think that a group
will be a better, more logical root to the tree.

I tried doing this:

{#item = #([groups, &quot;&quot;], #item);}

but i got back &quot;groups cannot be resolved&quot; in a java.lang.Error

Basically, the groups should be the root, and everything else a node,
and an empty group should still have a group as the root, just with
the text &quot;&quot; instead of a group.

I'm sure i've read how to do this, and i'm looking over the antlr docs
on tree construction now, but i'm missing it, i'm sure.

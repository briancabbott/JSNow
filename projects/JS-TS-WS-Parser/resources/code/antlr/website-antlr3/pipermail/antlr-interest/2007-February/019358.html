Hi,
	Read the DeveloperWorks tutorial: Creating Commercial Quality
IDEs on top of Eclipse. This is a good article to develop your IDE
plugin on Eclipse framework using Antlr for language recognition,
development of Abstract Syntax Tree and Document Object Model. Also it
gives a good insight into design details with some code snippets. Follow
the link:

Subject: [antlr-interest] antlr as a model for a language editor

Hello,

I am writing an eclipse-based editor for a tiny domain language using
antlr. I do understand the basic editing eclipse technology. However, I
am
trying to learn how to use antlr facility as the model for syntax
highlighting, completion etc. I have seen only some anectodal evidence
of
the work done already in this field and would appreciate either the
pointers to the existing code or general design suggestions.

Thank you very much.

Vladimir

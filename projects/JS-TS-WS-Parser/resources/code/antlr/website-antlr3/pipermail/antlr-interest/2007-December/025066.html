<PRE>I've been working on an AST generating grammar for Java, which I  
intended to distribute when it was finished.  It's not yet finished,  
but I would certainly appreciate help and/or would be glad to help you.

What you point out is definitely an error in the grammar.

I'm attaching what I've got so far (which includes the error) so you  
can take a look at what I've done and criticize it (or trash it).

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been working on the new grammar but have run into a few things

</I>&gt;<i> example, it can currently match the annotation:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> @Broken(&quot;Default Parameter&quot;, &quot;Illegal Parameter&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The 2.7 grammar won't let this pass.  To add to my dilemma, it is  
</I>&gt;<i> obviously possible to make do with Antlr 2.7 as I've seen some  
</I>&gt;<i> syntax highlighting projects based on it.  What I am wondering  
</I>&gt;<i> boils down to three questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Is anyone else working on the Java grammar at the moment that  
</I>&gt;<i> would mind collaborating?
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  Are the reasons for using ANTLR 3 compelling enough for me in  
</I>&gt;<i> my case?
</I>&gt;<i> 3.  Are people using the new Java grammar for anything serious.

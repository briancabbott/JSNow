I don't see that you were answered so I will venture a superficial 
response. I think that ANTLR is as good or better of a tool for what you 
are doing as any other parser generator. It is definitely better than 
using perl regular expressions. You should know that you will run into 
problems when you start dealing with unreserved keywords. The lexer 
might also give you problems unless it is easy to recognize when you 
switch between SQL and PL.

 &gt;But I need a WS because I want to allow superfluous spaces

 &gt;without encumbering the array rule with ( *) and such.

If it's just superfluous spaces you want to keep, then you can 
simply remove the newline characters from the WS rule and 
everything will be fine.

If you want to permit superfluous newlines as well then really you 
shouldn't be trying to match them at the parser level.

Ok, yes, it's in that example you posted, but that seems a bit 
dodgy to me.  As I said before that will do the &quot;wrong thing&quot; when 
faced with multiple newlines or newlines followed by other 
whitespace.

 &gt;OK, maybe with experience one can decode it but do all runtime
 &gt;problems lead to blowups? Why doesn't it just say &quot;Invalid 
input:
 &gt;[] at line 3&quot; or some such?

Really that ought to produce a compiler warning (or error), since 
the ANTLR compiler ought to be able to figure out the cardinality 
in most cases (although as I said before there are some constructs 
that can be misleading).

At runtime though it's mostly too late.  You see, it's already 
successfully matched &quot;[]&quot; as valid input (which it is, according 
to your grammar), and now it's trying to put that into an 
AST.  The rewrite rule is telling it that there must always be an 
&quot;elements&quot; term, but as it happens it doesn't have one.  What else 
can it do but to blow up?

This is where having unit tests to exercise your lexer/parser is a 
good idea, since you'll catch this sort of thing at that point 
(assuming your test cases are comprehensive enough).

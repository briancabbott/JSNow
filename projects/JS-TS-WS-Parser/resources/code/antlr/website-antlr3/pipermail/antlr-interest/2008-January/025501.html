Well, there is extra setup for exception handling and so on - hence all 
the goings on with Embedded C++ specs. It never turns out as lean as C 
and most programmers screw it up royally ;-P

&gt;<i>

</I>
No, obviously not. In fact I am not sure that std:string is too terrible 
when you are not allocating millions of them that won't even be used, 
but it is probably high enough to look at alternatives.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;I think doing this in phases makes a lot of sense.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Definitely.  The obvious first phase would be to get the C runtime
</I>&gt;<i> C++-safe (which last time I checked it almost was, there was just
</I>&gt;<i> one function somewhere that used a C++ keyword as an identifier, I
</I>&gt;<i> think).  The second phase would be to make C++ wrappers for the
</I>&gt;<i> existing C runtime.
</I>
Yep - it is a few #ifdefs and a change in a couple of the sources.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The thing is, I'm not convinced that making C++ wrapper classes
</I>&gt;<i> would actually be faster or simpler than making full C++
</I>&gt;<i> classes.  Trying to take a C++ object (with polymorphic methods)
</I>&gt;<i> and pass it across to the C runtime could get a little
</I>&gt;<i> tricky.  Doable, of course; I'm just not sure it's worth the
</I>&gt;<i> effort.
</I>
Yep. Though in the first instance I am really only interested in neater 
syntax for action code. I bet that is all that virtually everyone needs 
to be honest.

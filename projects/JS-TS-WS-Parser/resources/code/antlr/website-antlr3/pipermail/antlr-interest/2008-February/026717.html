</I>&gt;<i>  from an IBM AS/400. They're entered by humans and are very messy, but
</I>&gt;<i>  the vast majority do have some structure that can be recognized and
</I>&gt;<i>  parsed, say, by regular expressions. I just need to decide which part
</I>&gt;<i>  of the line represents a name, which represents a date, etc. I could
</I>&gt;<i>  write maybe 100 regular expressions and apply them until I got a match
</I>&gt;<i>  to recognize most of them. But I think this does a lot of the same
</I>&gt;<i>  work over and over, making it slow. I might be able to write a truly
</I>&gt;<i>  horrendous regular expression that doesn't redo as much work, but it'd
</I>&gt;<i>  be hard to maintain. I think maybe ANTLR's memoize might help a lot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  But the only token I can think to make is CHARACTER. Sometimes a date
</I>&gt;<i>  looks like 2008-02-22, but something that looks that way isn't
</I>&gt;<i>  necessarily a date, so I don't want to make a token for it. Usually if
</I>&gt;<i>  you see 'int' or whatever, you can say without hesitation that means a
</I>&gt;<i>  certain thing and can generate an appropriate token, but I don't think
</I>&gt;<i>  I can here. There aren't any keywords. I basically want to use ANTLR
</I>&gt;<i>  as if it was a way of building a regex that would be way too difficult
</I>&gt;<i>  to make/maintain by hand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  So people with a lot of experience, please say whether using ANTLR is
</I>&gt;<i>  probably good or probably bad. If probably bad, are there more
</I>&gt;<i>  appropriate technologies? Thank you.

This sounds like a job for AWK.

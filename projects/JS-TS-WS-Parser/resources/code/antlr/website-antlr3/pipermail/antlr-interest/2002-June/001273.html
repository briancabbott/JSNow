Good point. Just let me climb off my hobby horse and get my feet back on the
ground.

11c)  The ability to name a version.  This is equivalent to tagging a point
in the undo history and giving it a name.
Could be convenient to collapse the undo list to display just the tagged
items and to be able to &quot;undo to tag&quot; or &quot;expand tag&quot; which would expand the
undo list between this tag and the next most recent tag.
Obviously &quot;File SaveAs&quot; would still be available to save a version as
something else, complete with its undo history would be nice.

P.S. I would be interested on working on this as it has applications
everywhere.  At the moment I have beta &quot;File SaveAs&quot; undoable object which
renames any existing file before saving the current one with that name.
Doesn't follow Java's undo interface though.  Need to fix that.

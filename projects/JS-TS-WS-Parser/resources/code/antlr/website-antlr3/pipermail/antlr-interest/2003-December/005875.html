<PRE>Yes, you do need to reset the lookahead buffer.  Doing your read from the
parser is a bad idea in general.  If you are strictly k=1 in your parser and
don't use any syntactic predicates then you may be able to do it reliably,
but I would strongly recommend doing it in the lexer.  ANTLR lexers are
powerful enough to actually be parsers in their own right.

Not being familiar with PostScript I'm not sure how practical that is.  For
this one rule you could use lexer states.  But wait, does the interpreter
use information on the stack for how many bytes to read?  

If so, you may be better off maintaining your stack in the lexer.  

The core of the problem is that the parser needs k tokens ahead of the
current match to be able to predict what to match next.  That &quot;k&quot; is at
least what you say k is, but with a syntactic predicate k is unbounded.  So
in the extreme case you may have already lexed the entire input stream
before you even start parsing.  The lookahead buffer is filled as needed, so
it doesn't always have k elements in it.

What is really happening below is that the lexer, which also has a lookahead
buffer, has already read the 'CR' and has it in its lookahead buffer.  It
has not lexed the whitespace yet.  The input stream has not read the LF yet.
Luckily for you, in this particular production the parser didn't need to
know LA(1) yet.  If it needed that then the whitespace would have been lexed
and skipped and then X would have been lexed, turned into a Token and put
into the parser's lookahead buffer.  The lexer would have read the following
LF to know to end lexing X and the input stream would be set at the
following CR.

Solution?  Do it in the lexer and switch lexer states when you know you're
going to read a fixed amount of data.  And before switching call the WS rule
to read all of the whitespace before the data.  I believe there is a note on
the antlr website or FAQ or manual about reading fixed length records for
more details.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Re: Positioning input stream (was EOL sequence)

Thanks for all the replies to date. Terence, I did look at your 
parser, which was a partial PostScript parser, but I am currently 
far past your example. I am using &quot;k=2&quot; for the lexer. I have 
cleaned up some of the ambiguity warnings - thanks to many people.

I have no problem consuming whitespace when I am *parsing* or 
*lexing*. The problem arises with PostScript's read operators, which 
permit interruption of the parsing process to read arbitrary data 
from the current input stream. 

PostScript has almost no productions. Once a token is recognized, it 
is immediately executed by the parser. The parser does not have to 
match against any sequence of tokens - all tokens are standalone. In 
this example, 

currentfile read&lt;LF&gt;X&lt;LF&gt;

&quot;currentfile&quot; is recognized as a name token, passed to the parser, 
and is immediately executed by the parser. Then &quot;read&quot; is recognized 
as a name token, passed to the parser and immediately executed. Now 
the read operator pulls one byte from the input stream, in this case 
the &quot;X&quot; byte from the input stream. For a EOL sequence of LF or CR, 
this sequence executes as expected - the next read from the input 
stream does indeed return the &quot;X&quot; byte. However, when I return from 
executing the read operator, two whitespace sequences are recognized 
by the lexer, a LF and another LF. I expected one since the input 
stream should now be positioned past the X - but why is there 
another? Do I need to clear out the lookahead buffer, and if so, how 
do I do this? 

For PostScript, standalone white space is tossed out, so this 
particular sequence is not a big problem unless I want an accurate 
line number. But the following sequence is a problem.

currentfile read&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;X&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;

Here the read operator picks up the &lt;LF&gt; instead of the X. When I 
return from executing the read operator, the lexer recognizes a CR 
and the &quot;X&quot; character. Since &quot;X&quot; is not a valid PostScript name 
operator (semantics not syntax), the interpretation fails. 
PostScript expects the read operator to obtain the &quot;X&quot; character and 
the next whitespace sequence to be the final CR-LF. 

It seems like I need advance warning that a CR-LF sequence is coming 
before a name operator like &quot;read&quot; is executed. But the next token 
has not yet been requested by the parser.

Any thoughts on how to get out of this?

   Regards,

      Steve

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have worked out enough details with the EOL sequences to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understand where my PostScript parser is failing. PostScript 
</I>parsers
&gt;<i> &gt; have to be able to handle the following four example sequences
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; identically:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; currentfile read 3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; currentfile read&lt;CR&gt;3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; currentfile read&lt;LF&gt;3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; currentfile read&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where the &quot;currentfile read&quot; operator sequence instructs the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PostScript interpreter to read one byte from the input stream.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is no issue with the first three examples. The input stream
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; point just past the EOL byte once the &quot;read&quot; operator has been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recognized. Then the read operator simply has to pull one byte 
</I>from
&gt;<i> &gt; the input stream (a FileInputStream in this case).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, in the fourth case, the input stream points to the &lt;LF&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; character when the &quot;read&quot; operator has been recognized. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PostScript spec states that &quot;Any of the three forms of EOL ... is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; treated as a single white-space character.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How do I handle this? What can or should I do in the lexer 
</I>versus in
&gt;<i> &gt; the parser?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

<PRE>Hello George,

&gt;<i> Just dipping my toes in the ANTLR waters do to speak..  In other words, I am
</I>&gt;<i> definitely new at this, so a couple quick questions.
</I>
my name is Udo, same situation.

&gt;<i> 1)       Is this list/email address the best way to ask questions?
</I>
Yep.

&gt;<i> 2)      Any idea when &quot;The Definitive ANTLR book&quot; will be updated?  It
</I>&gt;<i> appears to be based on 3.0, whereas the ANTLR product is 3.3. I still
</I>&gt;<i> purchased the book, and it is helping tremendously.
</I>
I bought both books from Terence and I hope that they will be updated, too.

&gt;<i> 3)       My language of choice is Delphi.  Does anyone have a sample grammar
</I>&gt;<i> and the Delphi equiv of Test.java that they could send me.?  (George at woh
</I>&gt;<i> dot rr dot com)
</I>
I'm a C++Builder user. Because I'm a hardware guy and due to some historical
reasons, Delphi (Pascal) isn't MY programming language at all. But of course
I'm interested to get ANTLR working with Delphi, too.

&gt;<i> 4)      How do I handle case insensitivity?  For example, assume in the
</I>&gt;<i> following grammar that the token 'CALL' can be all caps, all lower letters,
</I>&gt;<i> or a mix.  How do I recognize it?
</I>
At the moment, I'm still busy to get all my development tools working, so
I can't help you with that ANTLR problem. What I have done so far:
- Tried to get the C target language working with C++Builder
   - Problems with missing Object-files. That's an typical C++Builder-issue.
     I installed now Visual C++ 2010 Express, but no progress at the moment
     because my focus moved to Eclipse temporarily.
- Eclipse
   - installed
   - ANTLR-plug in installed
   - Python-plug in PyDev installed

When you look in the ANTLR interest archives (yep, I looked for an search
option, too) you will find some questions related to C++Builder and Delphi
from me. But until now no echo out of the universe.

Pls. send me a PM, so we can discuss our further cooperation.


Greetings
Udo

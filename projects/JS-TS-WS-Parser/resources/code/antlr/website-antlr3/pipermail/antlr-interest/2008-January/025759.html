<PRE>I am confused about what you mean by this: &quot;The first version of ANTLR,
i.e. version 3.0? &quot;.
I mean the runtime. My team signs all the assemblies that we emit. That
requires all the references to be signed as well. This is the only
reason (at least so far) for me to go with 3.1 even though it is still
not released.

Thank you for your time,
Alexei

The first version of ANTLR, i.e. version 3.0? Or do you mean 
specifically the runtime?

&gt;<i> Is there a regular schedule associated with
</I>&gt;<i> builds? Do you have any approximation for release date? 
</I>
The schedule in general is &quot;when I have time to check for new changes&quot;. 
But I plan to bring the target over the next two weeks on par again with

the Java target.

<PRE>Patrick:

have a look at TeXlipse (<A HREF="http://texlipse.sourceforge.net/">http://texlipse.sourceforge.net/</A>). This might give 
you many clues on how complicated it is to parse TeX/LaTeX sources.

So far I found it quite comfortable to have a &quot;makefile project&quot; for antlr 
related stuff and a separate Win32 project for the bulk of a project. Not 
really an integrated thing, but it works and I never had problems compiling 
the C++ support libs (refers to Vs 2003 and Antlr 2.5.[5|6]).

<PRE>In java, the same class (CharScanner), has a method setTabSize(). Lexer 
extends CharScanner so the method is available to the lexer. Sorry, I 
don't use the c++ target so I can't help you any further.

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I am disappointed in not receiving any response to my query (Vol.36, 
</I>&gt;<i> Issue 41, No. 9) about the use and control of tab settings in ANTLR 
</I>&gt;<i> (2.7) which I repeat below.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Is this because there is a perfectly good description somewhere? If 
</I>&gt;<i> so, I have not been able to find it by searching the ANTLR2 website 
</I>&gt;<i> and I would be grateful if someone could tell me where it is.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Question 1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I want to use a tabsize of 4 characters instead of 8 as assumed in the
</I>&gt;<i> constructors in CharScanner.cpp which I have changed to 4.  Is there
</I>&gt;<i> any other way of altering this value without altering a library
</I>&gt;<i> function?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Question 2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In order to adjust column numbers correctly I have inserted an action
</I>&gt;<i> after detecting a tab character in the lexer of &quot;tab()&quot; as required
</I>&gt;<i> which should adjust the column number appropriately.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When there is a tab at the beginning of a line, but not elsewhere, the
</I>&gt;<i> column number is incorrect (too many by the tabsize) and the reason
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be that when the tab is at the beginning of a line the tab
</I>&gt;<i> function is entered twice so that the column number is advanced to 9
</I>&gt;<i> instead of only 5 (in my case).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I cannot see any reason for this (there appears to be only one tab at
</I>&gt;<i> the beginning of the line) but I can cure the problem in tab() by first
</I>&gt;<i> checking if the column number is 1 then setting the new column to 2 so
</I>&gt;<i> that on the second entry of tab() the column number is only advanced
</I>&gt;<i> by tabsize once (to 5 in my case) .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is the function working correctly and, if so, what am I doing wrong?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> David.

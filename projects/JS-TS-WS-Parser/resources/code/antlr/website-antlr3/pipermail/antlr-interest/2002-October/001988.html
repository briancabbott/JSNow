<PRE>I think you're right, it sounds like a mistake.

Monty, 
I use the &quot;testLiterals&quot; option in my grammar's. However, I was referring to
the &quot;literals&quot; option as indicated in this sentence that is just before the
one that refers to the &quot;testLiterals&quot; option. 
&quot;Second, literals may be specified in the lexer grammar by means of the
literal option.&quot; 
The word literal is a link, and refers to &quot;options.html#literal&quot; which is
not on options page. I don't think it exists, and is a mistake in the
documentation.
I would be happy to give some opinionated feedback about how the web site
could be structured. I will put some thought into it.
Richard

It's at <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/doc/options.html#_bb8.">http://www.antlr.org/doc/options.html#_bb8.</A> 
By the way, Ter (and I'm gonna help) is about to embark upon a restructuring

of the docs and website.  It would help a lot if you could explain how the 
documentation should be, in your opinion.

Monty, 
Thanks for the link. When I read that chunk of documentation, I interpreted 
it to mean any double quoted string, including those specified in a tokens 
section. It turns out that I got lucky I guess, because double quoted 
strings in a tokens section are placed in the literals table. All that being

said, I'm not sure it matters whether double quoted string literals are 
specified in the tokens section, or inline. On examining the code, I've been

unable to find sigficant function differences. 
BTW, I was unable to find the literal option referred to in the 
documentation. Do anybody know what it is?

Monty, 
Where in the documentation does it talk about keywords being specified as 
literals? I want to check it out to make sure I didn't screw up my grammars,

and give bad advice.

Subject: Re: [antlr-interest] C++ TokenStreamSelector


&gt;<i> My parsing problem is that sometimes fields in my text file are 
</I>&gt;<i> delimited by '.', ':', ';', and various other tokens. My problem is
</I>that 
&gt;<i> in many cases these characters are part of the values of the fields
</I>and 
&gt;<i> in other cases they are delimiters. I can only know which is which at 
</I>&gt;<i> parse time. So I thought what I was doing was the natural solution. 
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously I just misinterpreted the documentation!
</I>
&gt;<i> Does anyone have any advice for how to approach this problem? None of 
</I>&gt;<i> the examples in the antlr documentation deal with this sort of
</I>grammar.

What is usually happening is that you are trying to do too much work in
the one place (the first parsing pass and the lexer). You could of
course write a hand crafted recognizer that could do this, but in
general communications between lexer and parser are difficult and of
course maintaining a hand crafted recognizer usually outweighs the
flexibility of parsing.

Try to construct lexer and parser rules that can construct a tree that
will be valid one way or another. Then, when the parse has consumed the
tokens, you can either pass the resulting AST to a further pass, that
will use semantic context to decide what it really means, or, if
possible at the end of the parse of a particular rule, rewrite the
tokens you have parsed as a tree with the correct semantics. As in you
are collecting the information required to make the judgment at the
first pass time and can guarantee to always have the information at the
point of disambiguation (at the end of some rule that allows its use.)

Maybe that isn't so easy to follow as text so here is an artificial
example that might help ;-). 

Let's invent a language that has identifiers with combinations of upper
case letters and a dot as valid names. But let's suppose that '.' is
also used as Object.something. When you are lexing this, you don't have
any context so you don't know whether to return say ID or OBJECT DOT
METHOD. This should tell you that you don't want to use tokens like
that, but make compound parsing rules that work on more primitive lexing
tokens. Then you can do this for your lexer:

fragment
LETTERS : 'A'..'Z';
ID: LETTERS+;
DOT: '.' ;

So whether the input is an ID or an object reference the parser will
get: ID DOT ID

In your parser you can now do:

thingy: ID (DOT ID)? ;

Now, if you know that the declaration of something being an object will
ALWAYS precede the use of it as the parser sees it (line 1 through line
nnn), then when you see a declaration (let's say it is: object ID; which
makes no sense really but you get the point, then you can do this:

OBJECT : 'object' ;
SEMI : ';';

objdecl : OBJECT o=ID SEMI
		{ Some code to add o.text into a symbol table }

Now your thingy rule is (just where you put the actions depends on how
you detect (DOT ID)? and so on, but again this is just a silly example:

thingy: object=ID (DOT method=ID)? 
	{
		Code that sees if object.text is declared as an object 
		If not assemble the bits of .text into a full id
	}
	-&gt;{thingy::isObject}? ^(OREF $object $method)
	-&gt;                    ^(ID[$thingy::idtext])
;

You need to add some local variables to check and so on.

Languages may be syntactically constructed such that you cannot
guarantee to see the OBJECT declaration before the use of it. In this
case you have to rewrite the tree as it, then use a tree parser/pass to
find all the declarations at the correct scope, then reparse the tree
with that information and rewrite it with the correct context. A
difficult to parse language like C++ comes to mind for instance. 

So:
 - Split your tokens into the largest character collections that don't
mean it is too 
   late by the time the parser gets it (I know that doesn't sound too
well defined, 
   if in doubt make new tokens);
 - Construct parser rules that will accept all the combinations of these
that COULD be semantically
   valid. Note that you might end up constructing parser rules that
accept token strings that are
   syntactically invalid and have to reject them once you know the
context;
 - Either in the first pass if you have all the info as you go, or in a
subsequent pass if not,
   rewrite a tree that is now both syntactically and semantically valid.
Use as many passes as you
   need to do different things but bear in mind performance when making
multiple passes.

Then you will have a tree that you can optimize, walk for code gen, and
so on.

Hope that helps,

Jim

<PRE>Hi Andy,

&gt;<i> Forgive me if this has been discussed before or if it's not 
</I>&gt;<i> even an issue with more recent versions of ANTLR. I'm using 
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR 2.7.2.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a couple of minor suggestions for ANTLR-generated lexers:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Rather than (or in addition to):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> lexer.setObjectClass(&quot;some.package.MyToken&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to be able to specify my own Token factory:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> lexer.setTokenFactory(TokenFactory myfactory);
</I>
This is already present for ANTLR C# targets. The TokenCreator (as the
factory is called) is not an interface but an abstract base class (it
could/should have been an interface). For C#, creating instances via
reflection is [very?] expensive.

&gt;<i> 2) It would also be nice to have Token be an interface, and 
</I>&gt;<i> maybe rename the current Token class to &quot;BaseToken&quot; or 
</I>&gt;<i> something. It's not very likely that anyone would really need 
</I>&gt;<i> their Token class to inherit from something else, but it's 
</I>&gt;<i> possible. It just seems ugly to have those few methods in the 
</I>&gt;<i> Token class that don't do anything. We have set/get methods 
</I>&gt;<i> for column, line, filename, and none of them do anything in 
</I>&gt;<i> the Token class.
</I>
Once again, C# has an IToken interface. The Token class still exists however
with all it's methods intact. Think of it as a badly named abstract base
that isn't...erm...abstract. I chose not to change it in the ANTLR 2.x line.
It would have been a gratuitious breaking change with not much benefit.

IToken allows you (in C#) to create an alternative Token class hierarchy if
you so please.

Cheers,

Micheal
ANTLR/C#

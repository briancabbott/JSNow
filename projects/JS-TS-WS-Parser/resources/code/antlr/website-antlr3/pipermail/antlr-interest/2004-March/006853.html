Here are some unrealistic and inexpert ideas for ANTLR 3.

Rewrite ANTRL in C or C++.

Output parsers written in C or Python.

Print trees in an easy to look at form.

Is is necessary for the user to see as much java as he now has to?

An approach to the man-machine interface issues: if you were designing
a Python (Perl, ...) module that wraps around ANTLR, what would be the
classes and functions in the module?

A grammar is a highly terse description of a highly recursive stucture
with little internal documentation and with bits of java in it like
prions in a brain. Are there better ways to write down a grammar?

Should there be a separate chapter on ANTLR parsers in the Reference
manual?

Non-interactive debugger. Ideally, there would be an interactive
debugger where you see the tokens as they are fed to the parser and
also see the changes that are made in tha AST.

<PRE>The default 16 bit UCS2 stream is encoding unaware, never mind agnostic
;-). It just picks up the next 16 bits from the stream when asked for
the next character, and rewinds using 16 bits rather than 8. It is
UTF-16 without surrogates, unless you code your lexer to look for the
surrogates as two character pairs.

The code generator for C realizes that it must generate ASCII, so it
does not try to place any literal strings you define in your lexer in to
&quot;abc&quot; type strings, but in arrays of UTF32 characters, which means it
works perfectly.

So, I is Java specifying the lexer, so you get UCS2 Unicode encoding,
and your input stream basically supplies this as a stream of 32 bit
integers which are compared against the Unicode code points and it is
very efficient.

If your input encoding is not just ASCII 8 bit or UCS2, then you may
need to insert a translating version of the _LA function defined for the
input stream. A quick debug session will show you exactly what to do
until I document that bit more fully. It is more likely that you would
need this for strange 8 bit encodings that n a 16 bit input which is
more often than not UCS2 anyway. In essence then, the default streams
will cover about 90% of all cases I think.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: UCS-2/UTF-16 clarification
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry to be bothering you with so many questions, Jim... I just
</I>&gt;<i> wanted to ask you for some quick clarification about the UCS-2/UTF-16
</I>&gt;<i> support in the C language target. I'm initializing my stream using
</I>&gt;<i> antlr3NewUCS2StringInPlaceStream (the string is already in memory,
</I>&gt;<i> not coming in from a file).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is it correct that the C target is effectively &quot;encoding agnostic&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> ie. it doesn't really care what your input coding is, it just
</I>&gt;<i> operates on 16 bit integers? In other words, if I ensure that I
</I>&gt;<i> really do hand it UCS-2-encoded input then it will just do the right
</I>&gt;<i> thing?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My actual grammars are going to be in ASCII, even though the input
</I>&gt;<i> text they are expected to process could conceivably be in another
</I>&gt;<i> encoding, and ANTLR will convert those grammars into C source files
</I>&gt;<i> which again are just ASCII.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I just wanted to clarify this because of the minor differences
</I>&gt;<i> between UCS-2 and UTF-16; they overlap for the most part but only
</I>&gt;<i> UTF-16 supports surrogates and some glyphs require two characters,
</I>&gt;<i> whereas UCS-2 only ever users single 16 bit characters and no
</I>&gt;<i> surrogates (simpler but can't encode as many code points). But as far
</I>&gt;<i> as the C target is concerned, it's just working with 16-bit integers,
</I>&gt;<i> right? So in reality, as long as I hand it properly encoded UCS-2 I
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't have any problems? (I seriously doubt I'll ever have to
</I>&gt;<i> handle input which can't be encoded in UCS-2.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Wincent

<PRE>Hi,

 

I am in the process of building an ms-build target for antlr. Ideally I need
antr in a library for this.

I am using antlr 2.7.6 as version 3.0 doesn't have a .net runtime yet.

 

I have used a tool to translate all the antlr (2.7.6) source into msil byte
code and built a .net dll containing antlr. Works well actually!

I now need to figure out how to find out what files have been generated by
antlr during the processing of a grammar file. I would like to obtain these
in order that they be passed on to the compiler for compiling once they are
generated.

 

I suspect that I might accomplish this by adding the files opened by
Tool.openOutputFile to some kind of list, and making that accessible after
the generation is complete. I would make my own little static method that
calls doEverything, waits for the list to be populated by openOutputFile
calls and then returns the list of generated files.

 

Could someone confirm that this is a good way to accomplish the task?

 

I don't see any static entry points into antlr.Tool that may assist me in
the task, well besides the ones I mentioned. 

I would obviously prefer not to modify the source, even just a little bit.

 

Regards

Craig

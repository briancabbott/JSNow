<PRE>To my understanding ant doesn't have any notion of dependencies, it relies
on the java compiler to handle them for .java files and doesn't otherwise
deal with them for other types of files.

Subject: [antlr-interest] ant &amp; antlr


This may properly be a question about ant.  I posted (not cross-posted)
a similar question to the ant mailing list, but I suppose I may be more
likely to get an answer here than there.

The question is, can anyone tell me how to get ant to recognize
dependencies on exported/imported token vocabularies?  The antlr task in
ant does not seem to know (and perhaps cannot know) that a parser or
lexer should be regenerated if its imported token vocabulary changes. Is
there a good way to set ant up to handle this?

I spent a frustrating hour last night looking for an error in my
grammars or input files which turned out to stem from the fact that my
lexer was using an outdated input vocabulary, i.e. my parser had changed
but ant did not run my lexer grammar through antlr again.

Terence, if you read this, I note your recent comment that you hate
ant.  I am pretty new to ant, but so far I sure as hell don't love it
either.  I'm stuck with it on my project for now, though.

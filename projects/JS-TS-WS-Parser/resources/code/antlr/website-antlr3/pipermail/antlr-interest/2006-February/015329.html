Well, you need a pure flat simple string for the overall token you  
are creating.  You need to copy from the buffer anyway into the new  
stirng, right?

&gt;<i> Just recording the indices and copy to buffer once I see a bang and

</I>&gt;<i> I could probably set some flag if I've seen a bang and only then

True, but messier I suppose.  Perhaps we should think about the  
common case like removing the quotes off of string and char  
literals...how complicated do you want the average case to be...

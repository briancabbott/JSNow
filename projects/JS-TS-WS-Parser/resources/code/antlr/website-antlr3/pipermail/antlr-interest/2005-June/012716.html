<PRE>Yes, I am not a Java basher, but surely you should not need to develop
such a thing. This is more a reflection of Swing and the way it does
things than Java itself of course.

Hi Jim, 

Java is not that slow, it only appears to be if the GUI trys to do all
the work on the main thread.

Liberal use of background threadsimproves the user's perception of
speed.

That's why I developed my Threadspackage

	My only fear (hoping not to start a religious war) is that
graphical tools built in Java always seem to crash, hang, have slow GUIs
and so on (at least on windows, and though it would be easy to blame
Windows, I don't think that is the issue). At the moment this tool
suffers form the same issues - though I am loathe to offer any judgment
at this stage in the game - I would prefer to contribute to its
betterment.

&gt;<i> But this is *CVS*. Do not know how to do it with perforce. Is it

</I>&gt;<i> Thought I heard it is free for open source development?  Are there
</I>&gt;<i> plugins available for the prominent IDEs?
</I>
Given that this is the Antlr forum, let me humbly suggest that you go check
out www.perforce.com for those answers (which are &quot;yes&quot;, BTW :-).

To be more clear, the Perforce client applications are free and available
for most platforms.

There are plug-ins for some IDEs but since I prefer the command-line
perforce client, I don't keep track of which IDEs are supported or not.

Perforce does license their server for open-source projects for no cost.
That's what Ter is running for Antlr.


&gt;<i> Although I know the advantages of perforce over CVS and you would not
</I>&gt;<i> want to switch back to CVS when you have seen perforce, would you
</I>&gt;<i> consider making ANTLR visible to the outside with CVS? The drawback would
</I>&gt;<i> be you would have to merge your changes in perforce with CVS and
</I>&gt;<i> vice-versa. The advantage is everybody knows CVS and has the tools for
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>
Bah!  What a complete waste of time that would be.

Take care,
	John

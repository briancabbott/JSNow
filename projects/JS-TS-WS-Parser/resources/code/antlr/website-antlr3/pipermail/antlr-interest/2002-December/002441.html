<PRE>Hi,

There's some rough-ish stuff to write out trees in XML in the classes.
Compile with ANTLR_SUPPORT_XML defined then in your derived classes
override the toStream methods to customize your output.

operator&lt;&lt; works by calling the derived classes toStream methods (pretty
common way to do these kindoff things).

operator&gt;&gt; is a bit of a different problem. Think it's not possible to
implement reading in the sense of a operator&gt;&gt; since things have to got
through the ASTFactory to work in the most general heterogenous AST case.
Look at ASTFactory::LoadAST and friends. In practice the XML stuff mostly
works but it still needs work/docu for the general case. 

Cheers,

Ric

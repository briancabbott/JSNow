</I>&gt;<i>hi.  My experience is that if you need to look back, it's just as  
</I>&gt;<i>easy to keep a ptr in each rule of interest you enter so you can  
</I>&gt;<i>simply ask for the tree location for the rule above you. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Doesn't that mean that in general, you have to keep a ptr for 
essentially all rules?
In other words, if I want to know if the current statement is somewhere 
within a
&quot;for&quot; block, I need to keep a ptr at each rule in which I might end up 
with an AST
that has a &quot;statement&quot; somewhere under a &quot;for&quot;.

That seems a lot more difficult than just overriding CommonAST to 
provide a parent and
being done with it.

&gt;<i> Remember  
</I>&gt;<i>that when you want to look up, you mean you want to know your  
</I>&gt;<i>context.  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Not always. I often had to look at other places in the AST, and a stack 
with the current
context wouldn't have done it. For example, when manipulating C code, I 
see a &quot;%d&quot;
somewhere, look up the tree for the &quot;printf&quot; node, and then look down 
for the appropriate
child to get the &quot;printf&quot; argument that matches my &quot;%d&quot;. Context is not 
enough.

  Agreed.  I'm trying to get everything out of actions.

&gt;<i> a!:
</I>&gt;<i> 	b:myB c:myC foo:myD { #a = #(#foo,#(#[FOO],#b,#c)); }
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> a:

</I>
It would become:

a : myB myC myD -&gt; ^(myD ^(FOO myB myC))
    ;

How does that look to you?  Looks good to me. :)  About as clean and 
straightforward as you can get.

Loring, what would your inline solution look like?  Should just need a 
^[FOO]^ or something, right?

&gt;<i> If you take node construction out of the {} actions it should be 
</I>&gt;<i> clearly
</I>&gt;<i> visible that it's an &quot;imaginary&quot; constructed node and not being 
</I>&gt;<i> matched.
</I>
Yes, there can be an ambiguity with respect to referencing elements.

&gt;<i> Maybe use [FOO(args)]?
</I>
Yes, i was thinking that FOO is actually shorthand for FOO[] with no 
arguments.  FOO[args] would call a different constructor the default 
constructor (factory method actually).  So if you have

a : FOO -&gt; ^(FOO[] FOO) ;

you get

FOO
  |
FOO

where the top FOO is an imaginary node.  Just my first thought.

&gt;<i> Anyway what I read seems like a good improvement from the current 
</I>&gt;<i> stuff,
</I>
Hooray!

&gt;<i> at least to me. I'm going to bed now as it's 1 AM in Good Ol' Europe,
</I>&gt;<i> have a good night and ship ANTLR 3 soon ;-)
</I>
Sleep well!

Don't worry.  I'm working my ass off on ANTLR 3. :)  Once I nail down 
what the tree stuff looks like, I can implement quickly and then start 
cleaning up the tool for release and efficiency.  The runtime for ANTLR 
parsers/lexers is currently 22k in a jar. :)  The tree stuff will add 
some, but not that much really.  Maybe 3000 lines total of Java code.

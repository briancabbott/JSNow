</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR's approach to the general problem is syntax tree 
</I>&gt;<i> transformation (possibly multiple passes) followed by an &quot;output&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> pass which might generate an internal form that might not be tree 
</I>&gt;<i> structured or might produce code.  Ter is working towards an &quot;output 
</I>&gt;<i> template&quot; approach for this final pass--details are still being 
</I>&gt;<i> worked out.  I think that their &quot;rule based semantic analysis&quot; could 
</I>&gt;<i> be effected through one or more transformation passes, one or more 
</I>&gt;<i> linking passes (tree walks which build links connecting AST nodes), 
</I>&gt;<i> and a resolution pass to &quot;decorate the tree&quot; (attribute grammar 
</I>&gt;<i> terminology).
</I>
Is there any built-in support for the &quot;linking&quot; and &quot;decorating&quot; you talk about.  Being relatively inexperienced in this aspect, I found this to be one of the more confusing parts.  It was easy for me to see how the lexer, the parser and even the tree walker worked (and why they existed).

ANTLR was great for getting to the point where all the information was nicely arranged in a tree.  What I struggle with is &quot;Now what?&quot;.  For example, one of the first passes I could imagine doing on my AST would be type/name lookup.  Once I've done that, I'd like to keep that information around.  I'm assuming that is what you mean by linking.

Let me give you a quick example.  A simple Modelica package might look like this:

package Ford
  package Types
    type Torque = Real(quantity=&quot;Torque&quot;, units=&quot;N.m&quot;);
    type Pressure = Real(quantity=&quot;Pressure&quot;, units=&quot;N/m^2&quot;);
  end Types;

  model Test1
    Ford.Types.Torque tau;
    Types.Pressure P;
  end Test1;
end Ford;


In order to elaborate the model Test1, I need to find the information associated with the variables &quot;tau&quot; and &quot;P&quot;.  Note that while the definition of &quot;Torque&quot; and &quot;Pressure&quot; are in the same place (Ford.Types.*), I can reference them in different ways (Ford.Types.Torque vs. Types.Torque) but the semantics are the same in either case.

So, I have an AST node for my declaration that probably looks something like this:

#(DECL #(TYPENAME &quot;Ford&quot; &quot;Types&quot; &quot;Torque&quot;) #(COMPONENT &quot;tau&quot;))

Somewhere else in my AST I have something like:

#(PACKAGE &quot;Ford&quot; ... #(PACKAGE &quot;Types&quot; #(TYPE &quot;Torque&quot; ...) #(TYPE &quot;Pressure&quot;)))

What I'd like to be able to do is walk the tree and find every TYPENAME and then somehow link, as you say, that #(TYPENAME ...) node back to the #(TYPE &quot;Torque&quot;) node.

BUT, what I don't want is this:

#(DECL #(TYPENAME &quot;Ford&quot; &quot;Types&quot; &quot;Torque&quot; #(TYPE &quot;Torque&quot; ...)) #(COMPONENT &quot;tau&quot;))

right?  This would change my tree grammar.  I want links, but I don't want ANTLR to pay attention to those links for the purposes of tree walking.

Does this sound right or is my mental model of all this wrong?

Assuming I am right (which is a big assumption), I didn't see anything in ANTLR that supports these kinds of associations.  Am I missing something?  I know I can define my own AST node types and I could add some data structures to support linking but there were two reasons I didn't do this:

1) I figured if this is what I'm supposed to do then everybody would have to do it and ANTLR would support it somehow.  The fact that I didn't see this functionality in ANTLR led me to think perhaps I wasn't going about this the correct way.

2) I was quite concerned about how all this linking and associating would impact the garbage collection system for AST nodes.  To be honest, I find the whole process of defining a new AST type pretty complicated.  There seem to be so many different AST types and I never know when to use one or the other (e.g when do I use my AST type and when do I use RefAST, etc).

Now I'm not really blaming ANTLR for either of these issues.  I'm just saying that for me this was somewhat intimidating and so I was hesitant to get all tangled up in implementing these details.

These are just some things to consider in the development of ANTLR 3 that might make the tool easier and more approachable to people like me.

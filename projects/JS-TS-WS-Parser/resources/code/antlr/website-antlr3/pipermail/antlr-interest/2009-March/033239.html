</I>&gt;<i> Andreas,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What language are you trying to parse? 
</I>
It is SAP ABAP.

&gt;<i> I think that you have taken the wrong approach perhaps but it is a 
</I>&gt;<i> little difficult to advise without knowing what you are trying to 
</I>&gt;<i> parse. Basically, what Loring is saying is that you need to step back 
</I>&gt;<i> a bit. Unfortunately, when there are this many keywords and they can 
</I>&gt;<i> all be identifiers too, there will have to be some classification, 
</I>&gt;<i> just as in English there are verbs, nouns, and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps what you need is something like a set of explicit tokens for 
</I>&gt;<i> hard and fast keywords, then check ID at various other points. A 
</I>&gt;<i> hybrid approach in other words. Is the current grammar something you 
</I>&gt;<i> can email off-line rather than to the whole group? 
</I>
This is a bit tricky, the problem occurs only after adding up at lot of 
rules and the smallest error-inducing grammar (derived from the initial 
grammar by leaving out rules here and there) is 5000 lines long. I 
cannot expect anybody to look at this in detail :-)


&gt;<i> I suspect that the original parser for this language probably used a 
</I>&gt;<i> scannerless parser, or rather, a hand crafted program that was neither 
</I>&gt;<i> scanner nor parser in a 'real' sense.
</I>
It used (and uses) a chain of token sources, starting with an ANTLR 
generated lexer for most of the lexing work and some handwritten lexer 
adapters that manipulate the stream of tokens.

&gt;&gt;<i> On some power-point presentation from Terence Parr, I have seen a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> slide mentioning huge generated DFAs. Is there some additional 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> material available that documents some of the possible situations 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that make the DFAs explode?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> NFA and DFA are wider concepts than ANTLR of course - you will find 
</I>&gt;<i> plenty of literature on this. As to ANTLR itself, then Ter is always 
</I>&gt;<i> willing to look at fixes/optimizations/etc but we need to provide some 
</I>&gt;<i> sort of concrete example. In many cases it is a matter of design and 
</I>&gt;<i> not bugs. When the DFA explodes because of dangling optional clauses 
</I>&gt;<i> in say a statement, it is often because there is no definitive end to 
</I>&gt;<i> a statement, such as Newline or ';' and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With a look at your grammar, I can probably help you.
</I>
I will try to come up with a minimal example that reproduces the behaviour.

Thanks a lot for your patience!

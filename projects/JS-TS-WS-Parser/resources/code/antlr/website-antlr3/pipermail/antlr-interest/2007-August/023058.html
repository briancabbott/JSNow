IIRC, it we couldn't agree. Some people wanted this, others wanted that.

&gt;&gt;<i> In some cases the names actually propagate further than that, but  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> target

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But I agree that &quot;getting it right&quot; should have priority.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wouldn't a regeneration propagate the right names? Or does client code
</I>&gt;<i> access those internals?
</I>
E.g. the class names of rule return structures have a prefix of the  
parser class
name to prevent name clashes, since ObjC doesn't have namespaces.  
Likewise with
the defines for token types.
There's not really a way around that, but it might not be a hard  
thing to fix either.
It just crossed my mind.

&gt;&gt;<i> So my suggestion still stands:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grammar Name; generates NameLexer, NameParser
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lexer grammar Name; generates Name
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parser grammar Name; generates Name
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> treeparser grammar Name; generates Name
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So far it is like mine.
</I>
Yes, but by making this the default we should, IMHO, give the user  
the option to
change the name of the generated classes (or at least the file names  
for languages that
aren't so anal about what code a file contains...)

cheers,

</I>&gt;<i> As far as I recall, Prashant never said it would be free. The &quot;video-only&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> previews were just to demonstrate what he was doing and gauge interest.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> RE &quot;testing a commercial product&quot;, have you never heard of public betas?
</I>&gt;<i> Many many many commercial products have public betas, and some even ask
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> you pay to participate (the M$ office betas, for example).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Absolutely nothing wrong with this, so please chill...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Prashant has chatted with me about price possibilities, and he's looking
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> keep it inexpensive. I told him it's a very niche market and that he may
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> sell many unless the price is very low, and even then he probably wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> sell many.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you should view it more as a &quot;payware&quot; tool than a commercial
</I>&gt;<i> product (as he's not doing this as a business).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do recommend that if you think ANTLRStudio may be potentially useful
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> you send a note to Prashant stating what you would be willing to pay for a
</I>&gt;<i> tool like that, as it may help him set a price.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Later,

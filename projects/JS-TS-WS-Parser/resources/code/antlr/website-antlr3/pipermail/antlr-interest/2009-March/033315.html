<PRE>I have to correct myself: I previously said that the generated DFAs were 
too big. Some were indeed exceeding the 64k limit, but I could fix that 
by splitting up some rules (as suggested). The class-size problem (there 
were 5000 lookahead DFAs with long initialization strings) I could also 
fix by just splitting up the grammar and importing the parts.

But, the actual surprising thing: the rule where I expected the 
biggest/showstopper DFA (the rule that includes all the 800 keywords) 
does not use anything complicated, just a handful of if-then-else. 
Without setting the -Xconversiontimeout to high values (20 seconds) 
ANTLR would timeout in exactly this rule, letting me think that indeed a 
huge prediction DFA is produced there. It seems that the DFA computation 
algorithm tries to determine if it needs a DFA in the first place, and 
it just takes a lot of time until it knows. Having ANTLR compute a 
result faster would be a nice-to-have, but at least it works now, 
despite the 800 keywords :-)

Anyway, I hope others can now avoid this pitfall.

Thank you for your patience and your suggestions!
Andreas

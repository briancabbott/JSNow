For example, there is jastadd (jastadd.org), which is a generator for 
attribute grammars. I have not used it (yet!), but it seems useful 
enough to build a Java 1.5 compiler with it. Still, there is a slight 
gap between the ANTLR grammar and the jastadd tree grammar, which uses 
its own notation. So, you would need to explicitly build an AST, 
suitable for jastadd: you cannot reuse ANTLRs tree building facility. 
Maybe bridging that gap could be an interesting topic? FYI : currently 
I'm writing a tree parser generator that operates on an already built 
ANTLR tree, which could be useful to bridge this gap (in constrast to 
the ANTLR tree parser, which works on a stream of tokens for the full 
tree, actually). Let me know if you are interested.

Cheers,
Andreas Meyer

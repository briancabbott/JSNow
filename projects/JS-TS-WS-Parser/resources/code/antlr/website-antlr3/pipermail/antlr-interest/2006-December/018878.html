<PRE>Howdy,

While writing the chapter on AST construction in the book, I realize  
I have made a mistake. I have created both ^^ and ^ operators where  
^^ is the new version of v2's ^ operator.  I created two different  
versions so that you could set the root of the entire tree and the  
root of the enclosing subtree using different operators.  This would  
have been very useful in v2, but I realize now that the rewrite rules  
are a much better way to specify trees that would require subrule  
tree roots. I am going to remove ^^ and make the semantics of ^ the  
same as they were in v2: set the root of the current rule's tree.

This has the added benefit of significantly reducing the complexity  
of the code generation for the automatic tree construction and AST  
operators. It will also make it faster and use less memory. good  
benefits all around.

Target developers: sorry for the change near the end, but I want to  
create what is correct and the book is helping me do a lot of  
thinking about the semantics of the ANTLR metalanguage. Fortunately,  
the change will be to simply remove some templates and/or slightly  
alter some existing templates... so the change should be minimal.  I  
will make sure that ANTLR itself tweaks the operator etc. I hope to  
have these changes done in the next couple of days as I finish up the  
tree chapter.

Ter
</PRE>

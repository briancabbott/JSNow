<PRE>Hi Terrence,
Hi Jim,

Our status is:
*  we have used ANTLR 2.7 C++ in our Valentina DB engine near to 10 years.
* we have start smooth steps to ANTLR3 switch more of year ago ...
    always something have interrupt us.

Now we have working grammar, and tree parser grammar,
and all this is integrated by #define into db engine, so far all good.

Now task is provide error reporting.
    How EASY this was in ANTLR v2 for us - C++ developers..
    And I already have spent two days reading reading reading
        site, docs, google, mail list, book, ...

Terrence, I do not complain, but IMO, at least for C target it is very hard
find on SITE, docs that answer major questions.

I believe, it is not correct way, push developers to search google, and prev
letters for last 3 years. Right?

While I have read letters, I have note, for example, one at 2009 year, where
is said
    @after is not supported in C target

So I ask self.  
* Hmm, I have NOT see this info in docs, which I have to read already. And
* Hmm, interesting if this feature still not implemented for C?

And may be I am blind, but I do not see such page on SITE/WIKI,
As

=========================================
            List of Features of Runtime Targets  v3.4
                               (and another pages for v 3.3  3.2  3.1  3.0 )

                Java        C           C#
    
@after      yes           no         ?
=========================================


You see my point?

I should say that ANTLR3 somehow is harder to use from box ...
May be at least for C target ...
May be at least comparing to what we are used in v2.7


Couple days ago you have asked about features for 4.x  :-)
I would like to ask add such major and important info into SITE.

</I>I was wrong. Sorry. I've just written a small program to test the
problem I thought took place and what I've found is that addChild() is
absolutely clean in conjuction with current implementation of smart
pointers in the sense I erroneously blamed it.

</I>It seems to be clean and therefore should not prevent you from sleeping.
;) There was no bug in the ANTLR code, just a small bug in my head :)
probably because of lack of sleep and most certainly because of
a strange tendency to find errors in others' code rather than in my own
;)

&gt;<i> Shouldn't there be a '!' on this rule to turn of automatic

</I>&gt;<i> This might create a loop in the tree which might hang up

</I>You are a clairvoyant! Exactly! This is what actually happened. Thanks
a lot for helping me out.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Arrays are either part of AST memory, in which case they are of fixed

</I>&gt;<i> a size field, and the array at a minimum.
</I>
Fixed length array would typically waste space (or raise errors if
they are too small). Agreed.

ArrayLists-type objects on the other hand don't have to waste space.
They become one pointer to the ArrayList which holds a size field and
an array with [approx] one pointer per child. The vtable is per class
not per instance.

For leaf nodes (where right == down == null) - one pointer is saved
since only one is needed for the ArrayList pointer (which would be
null too).

For internal non-leaf nodes - if the ArrayList is of the exact size
needed, only the ArrayList's size field is extra.

Aren't there always more leaf nodes?

&gt;<i>  This is offset by a savings
</I>&gt;<i>  for terminal (right == down == null) nodes, but that does not help
</I>&gt;<i> much with memory usage.  Arrays are memory hogs.
</I>
Fixed-length ones would usually be. Not convinced this holds for
ArrayLists.

&gt;<i> Locality is not a good argument.  The arrays would not be arrays of
</I>&gt;<i> ASTs, but of references to ASTs.
</I>
Good point. I did qualify my locality statement.

&gt;<i> The ASTs themselves would be
</I>&gt;<i> scattered to much the same extent in the two cases, and the variable
</I>&gt;<i> length arrays would contribute to memory fragmentation.
</I>
The variable length array *might* contribute to memory fragmentation
if there were frequent re-allocations due to arrays outgrowing their
current size. It would be quite easy to ensure this wasn't this case
during tree construction though.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Both ASTs and Tokens are then replaced by Carriers (probably with a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; better name).  This would have a performance advantage for tree
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; construction in the Parser since the token Carriers can be linked to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; form a syntax tree in the parser.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hmm, I am more inclined to eliminate [the cost of] Token objects
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [almost] entirely. I say almost because a mechanism is still needed to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transfer attributes like lexeme/line/col info to AST node objects.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not that easy.  You could have a fixed lookahead array, although that
</I>&gt;<i> would not work if syn preds are present, containing token data that
</I>&gt;<i> was then copied into ASTs as needed.  That leads to a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> copying--not very helpful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The TokenStream interface in it's current form might not be the [best]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way to go. Unless Token objects can be recycled efficiently.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Carriers can be very efficiently recycled--you can recycle carrier
</I>&gt;<i> nodes from a syntax tree to a Factory, which keeps them in a linked
</I>&gt;<i> list and then feeds them back on allocation requests.
</I>
OK, following on from this:

I can grok Token objects with Carrier objects as payload. Carrier is
passed unchanged to AST objects.

But Token objects and AST objects replaced by Carrier objects?. There
isn't a one-to-one match between Token objects and AST objects in many
 cases. How does the unified Carrier concept deal with this?

&gt;<i> &gt; So how can lexical tokens be modelled as an integer value (or enum
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; value) usually and yet parsers are able to extract additional info
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; such as lexeme/line/col on-demand and, inexpensively?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Token management in lexers is an art.  You have to avoid copying data
</I>&gt;<i> as much as possible for performance reasons and minimize memory
</I>&gt;<i> allocation.  llk does a reasonably good job; I think that Chris Leung
</I>&gt;<i> took advantage of lessons learned from flex and other lexer
</I>&gt;<i> generators.  Performance paranoia helps.  Payload objects could help
</I>&gt;<i> here, too--you can keep text start and end pointers into a
</I>&gt;<i> memory-mapped text file instead of allocating and copying strings.
</I>
Yep, right you are. Performance tuning is hard. You would typically
need to copy selected substrings from the input buffer to another
buffer where the start/end indices refer. Else, you might end up
keeping a 100kB memory-mapped file hanging around just for the sake of
a few substrings.

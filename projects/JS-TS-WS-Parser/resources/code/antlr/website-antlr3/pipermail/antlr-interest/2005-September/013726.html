<PRE>&gt;<i> I have no problem with commercial software. The problems, as 
</I>&gt;<i> far as I'm concerned, are:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) the beta expires after 7 days. This is hardly long enough 
</I>&gt;<i> to install it, let alone find out if it does anything useful.
</I>
I'll agree with that. Should be a bit longer...


&gt;<i> 2) No-one's going to evaluate a beta of commercial software 
</I>&gt;<i> without some idea of what it'll cost if it works.
</I>
I don't agree with that; I've seen plenty of people jump into public betas
of games and other commercial software without knowing the price.

You can make some assumptions about the price range, though.

Think about comparative products -- most of the M$ developer &quot;standard&quot;
products are around $100, but have more function than ANTLRStudio. (I bought
C# standard for around that I think). Most shareware asks $20-40, some a wee
bit more. I'd think he'll probably land around there, but I don't know for
sure. If he goes higher I don't think people will bite, but that's my
opinion.

I've sent in $20-$40 on several shareware in the past...

<PRE>Hi,

I am writing a parser for mel (a language based on tcl) and am having a lot
of problems getting the intricacies of the language to parse.

One of the main problems I am having is through using the semantic
predicates, both to make the grammar easier to read and to make a few of the
statements conditional on variables.

Firstly, if someone could explain the difference between semantic predicates
and gated semantic predicates that would be useful?

One of the errors I have come across is when passing variables around as
arguments, antlr does not pass the variables into the syntactic predicates
it generates for some reason (the synpred1() type functions). However, I
have found that I can edit this file by hand and add in the variables to the
arguments manually, but clearly this is laborious and time-consuming.

Here is a simple example of some mel code which I have had to resort to
semantic predicates in order to try and get round:


(1)  function;
(2)  function -flag;
(3)  function(&quot;arg&quot;);
(4)  function(3+4);
(5)  function (3+4) -flag;
(6)  $a = `function`;
(7)  $a = `function(function2)`;
(8)  $a = `function -flag`;
(9)  function(`function2 -flag`);


All of the above commands are completed valid, which demonstrates the
variety in the language in function calls alone.

This is the solution I have come up with in antlr grammar:

method[ticks]:
        { ticks == &quot;ticksallowed&quot; }? =&gt; '`' methodcall[&quot;ticksnotallowed&quot;]
'`' |
        methodcall[ticks]
    ;

methodcall[ticks]:
        methodname '(' expression[ticks] ')' (methodargs[ticks])* |
        methodname '(' expression[ticks] (',' expression[ticks])+ ')' |
        methodname methodargs[ticks] (methodargs[ticks])* |
        methodname ('('')')?
    ;

methodargs[ticks]: expression[ticks];

expression[ticks]: flag | number | STRING | method[ticks];

I have tried to simplify this to demonstrate the problem. In (6) for
example, in order to match the second backtick to an ending tick (rather
than the start of a new backticked method call which is clearly not
allowed), I pass around a variable to halt the parser from trying to execute
the backtick strand if it is already inside a backtick.

I have had many problems trying to get this to work though. Am I going about
this in the correct manor, or can someone suggest a better approach to this?

Thanks,
Dan

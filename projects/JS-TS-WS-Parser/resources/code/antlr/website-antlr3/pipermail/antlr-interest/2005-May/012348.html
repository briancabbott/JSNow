<PRE>I use the same technique; you can also compare the generated *.txt
files to make sure that a typo didn't introduce another token (been
there, done that).

So long as all *.txt files have the same content, any of them should work.

There is a disabled (commented out, I think) option to make ANTLR
generate a warning if new tokens are defined by the grammar, rather
than just using the imported set of tokens.  You should be able to
find it - I don't have the sources handy...

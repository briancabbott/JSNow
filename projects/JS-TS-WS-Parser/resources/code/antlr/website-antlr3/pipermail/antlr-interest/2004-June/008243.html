<PRE>Okay. First things first - you NEED to look up that ESC example in the
manual I gave you. But now let's try to rewrite your rule.
 
STRING_LITERAL
// string literals - the only token that can be split with an '&amp;'.
options {paraphrase = &quot;a string&quot;;}
 : '&quot;'! (AMP{token.setlen(token.getlen()-3);}|{greedy=false;}.)* '&quot;'!
 ;
 
What this is doing is first it finds your &quot; to start the string. Then it
looks for either an AMP, or anything that doesn't match your final &quot;
(that's the point of the &quot;greedy = false&quot; - the . won't eat any token
that matches the following token-match). And when it finds an AMP, the
setlen/getlen deletes it from the STRING_LITERAL that it's building.
 
This probably won't compile straight off - I've almost certainly got my
cases wrong, and there's probably other minor faults. But I hope I've
explained clearly what it's doing, and you should be able easily to
clean it up.
 
Cheers,
Wol

Hi Anthony,
 
Thanks for your input to this, it's been doing my head in!
 
Indeed, I've got the following worked out so far:

options {
 exportVocab=PVocab;
 k=3;
filter=AMP;
}
 
protected
AMP
//an &amp; and line break.
 :  '&amp;' '\r' '\n' {System.out.println(&quot;&amp; HIT!&quot;);newline();}
 ; 
 
STRING_LITERAL
// string literals - the only token that can be split with an '&amp;'.
options {paraphrase = &quot;a string&quot;;}
 : '&quot;'! (~('&quot;'))* '&quot;'!
 ;
 
This solves the first problem very well but the second point is that I
still want the STRING_LITERAL token to be passed as one token, even when
it's been split over 2 or more lines.
 
ie:
 
getrec(tag,&quot;select * from acct,x__ir &amp;
where acct001 = x__ir001 and &amp;
x__ir006 = 'V'&quot;)
 
Effectively I need the 3 lines of strings to be treated as 1 single
STRING_LITERAL token, eg:
 
getrec(tag,&quot;select * from acct,x__ir where acct001 = x__ir001 and
x_ir006 = 'V'&quot;)
 
and unfortuately shaving the last 3 characters wouldn't always work.
 
Again many thanks for your help,
 
Cheers
 
Craig

</I>&gt;<i> I think this is the same topic; sorry if I misunderstood...
</I>
No, you're right on target.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some of us do software for a living, and we have signed something with
</I>&gt;<i> our employer saying &quot;all my software belong to you&quot; (more or less).
</I>
Usually it's not quite that bad; it's &quot;all my software developed on company
time&quot;.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That means, using me as an example, that I cannot simply send a patch
</I>&gt;<i> to ANTLR; I have to get my employer to say it is &quot;a good thing&quot; to
</I>&gt;<i> contribute to ANTLR.
</I>
And if your employer is like mine, that contribution cannot be just &quot;given
away&quot;, it must be licensed intellectual property.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By saying Terence can blame me if my employer comes hunting for blood,
</I>&gt;<i> it gets him out of the middle.  He has a paper trail saying I told him
</I>&gt;<i> it was okay, so they can come hunting my head instead of Terence's.
</I>
Or someone else can go after your company, as with SCO and IBM.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, there is F/OSS.  No, I can't blithely contribute to it - my
</I>&gt;<i> employer is paying for exclusive use.
</I>
Yes, and Open Source contributions are usually acceptable where &quot;public
domain&quot; is not--intellectual property has become a sensitive issue.  I think
that Gerald's comments have been good advice, and I'm sure that the IP legal
business is booming.

If ANTLR 2 had been released under a formal Open Source license, I could
have released 2.8 under that.  Without one, and with current copyright law,
I could not.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Now to your point.  What I suggest is not hypocritical, but you are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; correct that the protections are asymmetric.  The free software market
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; place is not zero sum gain, but zero sum.  Wish the economic model was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; different, but without monetization, there is no rational way to
</I>&gt;<i> transfer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; risk in any direction.  In such situations, the only way to remain
</I>&gt;<i> viable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; is to minimize as much as possible risk from the outset.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's both asymmetric and hypocritical.  One of the big points about the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; intent of the F/OSS world is the removal of hypocrisy.  I.e. the point
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all of this is *more* than just the legal minimums.
</I>
[And up one level in the discussion:]  I am uncertain as to whether there is
real asymmetry or not and certainly have no clue as to what the &quot;legal
minimums&quot; are--they have yet to be determined through court cases.  &quot;Thou
shalt not sue for software failures&quot; seems to me to be a pretty stringent
restriction on the user (but &quot;don't leave home without it&quot;).  &quot;Thou shalt
not wittingly enable a lawsuit&quot; seems a fair restriction on contributors.

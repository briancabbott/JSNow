<PRE>I have been unable to find anything about the control and use of tab
characters in updating column numbers in the ANTLR2 documentation for
ANTLR 2.7. 
 
Question 1.
 
I want to use a tabsize of 4 characters instead of 8 as assumed in the
constructors in CharScanner.cpp which I have changed to 4.  Is there
any other way of altering this value without altering a library
function?
 
Question 2.
 
In order to adjust column numbers correctly I have inserted an action
after detecting a tab character in the lexer of &quot;tab()&quot; as required
which should adjust the column number appropriately.
 
When there is a tab at the beginning of a line, but not elsewhere, the
column number is incorrect (too many by the tabsize) and the reason
seems to be that when the tab is at the beginning of a line the tab
function is entered twice so that the column number is advanced to 9
instead of only 5.
 
I cannot see any reason for this (there appears to be only one tab at
the beginning of the line) but I can cure the problem by first
checking if the column number is 1 then setting the new column to 2 so
that on the second entry of tab() the column number is only advanced
by tabsize once (to 5).
 
Is the function working correctly and, if so, what am I doing wrong?
 
Thanks,
 
David.

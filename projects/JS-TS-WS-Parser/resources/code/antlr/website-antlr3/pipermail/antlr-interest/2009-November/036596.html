I have had to do this many times when I have something in my action
code that causes a compilation failure, but otherwise haven't had any
problems.  Do you get the timeout the very first time that you attempt
to run the debugger after a fresh application restart?

&gt;<i> 3. Port forwarded 49100 on my router. (I think this was unnecessary though, doesn't the localhosts
</I>&gt;<i> mean it's trying to connect to the remote parser on my own computer?)
</I>
So you went into preferences and set the port to 49100?

Yes, localhost implies the local computer, which doesn't usually have
ports blocked.

I'm not sure what OS you're on, but what port(s) does netstat show
ANTLRWorks is using?

&gt;<i> 4. Tried running it with my computer's local static IP address in instead of localhost.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> None of the above had any effect on the problem. I'm not really sure why it's occurring! Any help
</I>&gt;<i> would be nice, thanks.

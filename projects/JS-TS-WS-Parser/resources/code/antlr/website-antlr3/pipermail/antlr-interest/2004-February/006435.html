I still not agree.

In the modern C++ exists 2 major conception:

    interfaces
    templates.    

Developer of good LIBRARY and FRAMEWORK must choose between them,
Or even mix them.

std::Streams are childs of STL and therefore are TEMPLATES.
std::stream IS NOT interface by its mean.

We in our project totally avoid using of STL classes.
Few reasons

1) we use many platforms and many compilers.
   Each compiler vendor provide own implementation of STL standard.
   You have NO guarantee that on some compiler some class do not have bug.
   Just look into release info of each C++ compiler!
   How many bugs are fixed in each new release.


2) second reason -- even modern C++ compilers still are not perfect on
TEMPLATES compilation. If you make
    #include &lt;stream&gt;

into almost empty .cpp file, the code size of this .obj file grow in about
100 KB in the LIBRARY.

If you have in project 1000 files then you get size blowing for NOTHING!
100MB thanks to STD classes. This is not acceptable for us.

On start we have wrap STD::stream by own own IStream interfaces,
As result only ONE .cpp file have grow to 100KB.   You see point?
And Now we ABSOLUTLY have THROW OUT usage of STL classes.


NOT STD::stream must be wrapper!!!
It self must be wrapped.


------
Back to ANTLR.

I am sure that ANTLR use just 2-4 simple calls to stream,
Read char, write char.

So it will be VERY EASY add SMAL interface,
And ONE SMALL implementation of this interface around std::stream.


Most probably nobody is going do this.
And today STL idea eat a lots of brains. Just look on BOOST.
Also great of course.

But NOT EVERYTHING must be made on TEMPLATES.
Interfaces are FAR FAR more powerful technique,
Especially for such projects as ANTLR.

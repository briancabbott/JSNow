Do you mean specifically ! or the ability to set/build-up the text?

&gt;<i> And there are cases where it's not that easy to figure out the text  
</I>&gt;<i> - the user would have to re-parse the text in $getText() to get to  
</I>&gt;<i> his result. That's almost certainly more expensive. Is there  
</I>&gt;<i> absolutely no way of supporting this in a &quot;if you use it you pay&quot; way?
</I>
Yeah, I tried...there is too much work to do that must be there if  
any ! is used in the grammar.

&gt;<i> Did you try StringBuilder instead? If you call .setLength(0) once  
</I>&gt;<i> per token it really shouldn't matter that much except for the  
</I>&gt;<i> synchronization on StringBuffer.
</I>
I have to be at least 1.4 compatible...is that 1.4?  That cost me  
200ms out of 2000 or so, which is a lot.

&gt;<i> What about the optimization of truncating start and end characters  
</I>&gt;<i> simply by using different offsets? I think this is the most common  
</I>&gt;<i> use case, e.g.:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> STRING: '\&quot;'! CHARS '\&quot;'!;
</I>
Yep, and a simple action with a substring will work; like 1 or 2  
places in the grammar you want; should be ok to do manually.

setText(getText().substring(0, getText().length()))

or whatever.  Or, just buffer up manually in CHARS.

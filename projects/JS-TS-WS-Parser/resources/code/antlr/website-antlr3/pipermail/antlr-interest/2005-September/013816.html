<PRE>Now then now then now then! I had the pre-cursor to the Sinclair Cambridge that had a BASIC interpreter. You are thinking of much more luxurious state-of-the-art than the original, probably one of them new fangled rich man's ZX80s or ZX81s. 
 
No, no, no, no. no! No BASIC interpreter there mate... not unless you count the one I wrote in 240 bytes of pure Z80 (not A) by using all the hidden instructions for IH that they forgot to delete. No... wait I am pretty sure it was 110 bytes, AND I didn't use t'top bit. I also gave it away in hand written hex on the back of beer mats, so long as you were willing to buy me enough beers to get t'beer mats because we couldn't afford beer mats in Yorkshire... in fact we couldn't afford the beer either. Nor the shoe leather to walk tut pub. Not that you'd get there anyway mind, because there were no street lights because we couldn't afford t'electric. In fact I had to power t'machine by dangling a some copper pipe (stolen of course) out o t'window when it rained, which it always did, and anyway we didn't have any glass in, in fact we didn't have any windows... &lt;fades into oblivion&gt;
 
And they PAY Eric for this sort of stuff!
 
Jim

	&gt; &gt; God I'm young... my first was a 640k, 16 something MHz
	&gt; &gt; on which I learnt BASIC and MSDOS 3.3 &amp; 5.0 more than
	&gt; &gt; a decade back :)
	&gt; 
	&gt; That's pretty good.  Some folks &quot;became conscious&quot; on 128M machines.
	;)
	&gt; 
	&gt; BTW, the 1.077mhz machine was the 6502 in the apple II. :)
	&gt; 
	
	Bloody luxury! I had t'Sinclair Cambridge wi' t'Hex Pad and an 8 digit
	LED display, to type in t'Z80 machine code directly mate. That's what I
	had to start with! And I had to build me own power supply and lick
	t'gravel on Clive Sinclair's driveway to get ROM updates. Bloody Apple
	II's - bloody luxury. And you try telling that t'ut kids o' today! 


Bull.  Yours was the luxury!  I wire-wrapped my first 8080 system with just 4Kbytes of 750ns memory.  The 8224 crystal was not stable above 700KHz.  I had to build an 8207 UVEProm programmer (and power supplies) and write my own boot monitor just to get the thing to run!

The Cambridge was a Z80A-based system that came with a Basic interpreter.  Anyone who worked with the real (original) Z80 knows that it came with an errata sheet that was as thick as the programmer's manual.  I think I still have it.  Now that was a programming challenge.

Try and top that you old softy!!

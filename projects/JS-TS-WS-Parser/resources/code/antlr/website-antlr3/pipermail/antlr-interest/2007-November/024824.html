</I>No it didn't. The text of outer token &quot;Tok&quot; is being constructed 
properly but the intermediate token &quot;f&quot; is created in the outer token 
using the boundaries of the text stream. It is not using the token 
created by the inner rule. I think that you have found a bug, or at 
least a design issue.

In the meantime, you have to get around the problem by using some global 
variables. The outer rule can set its own text.

But worse, this won't work either.

grammar x;
@header
{
    package generated;
}
@lexer::header
{
    package generated;
}
@lexer::members
{
    String fooString;
    String booString;
}

boo    :t=Tok{System.out.println($t.getText());};   
Tok: FOO BAR {setText(fooString+booString);};
fragment FOO: 'foo' {fooString=getText()+&quot;123&quot;;};
fragment BAR: 'bar' {booString=getText()+&quot;345&quot;;};
 
booString will get the value &quot;foobar345&quot; because the system still thinks 
that it is in the Tok rule which begins with &quot;foo&quot;.

This looks like something that one of the developers need to look at.

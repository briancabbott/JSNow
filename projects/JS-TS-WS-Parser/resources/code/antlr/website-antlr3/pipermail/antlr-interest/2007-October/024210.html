<PRE>Michelangelo was almost done with the Sistine chapel, and allowed Leonardo
to come in and have a look. After looking around a bit, Leonardo said:
&quot;You've missed a bit!&quot;.

Basically, You should use the methods given to get the text of tokens, but
in general I don&#8217;t intend that you should need to know what the changelists
are to use it of course. For various reasons that I did not agree with, the
original source used 8 space tabs and now I want this to be 4 space tabs -
in general I commit these and spelling errors in comments as separate
checkins, but not always as I correct some of this as I go along.
Ironically, both the change to use absolute pointers (though it does sound
like that isn't quite right for UCS2) and the correction to spelling errors
in comments, were done for you!

I will take your suggestions under advisement, but let's not lose track of
the fact that it is free and unencumbered and a little more complicated than
Git ;-)

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">bounces at antlr.org</A>] On Behalf Of Wincent Colaiuta
</I>&gt;<i> Sent: Tuesday, October 16, 2007 2:56 AM
</I>&gt;<i> To: Antlr Interest
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [antlr-interest] 3.0.1 C target woes
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Had some problems trying to get my lexer that worked under the 3.0 C
</I>&gt;<i> target runtime to work under the 3.0.1 runtime.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is solved now, so I'm posting this here for others in
</I>&gt;<i> case they run into similar issues.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, the lexer was crashing after lines like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    start = (const char *)(stream-&gt;data + (token-&gt;start * 2));
</I>&gt;<i>    len   = (token-&gt;stop - token-&gt;start + 1) * 2;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here I'm just trying to get a pointer to the start of the token text,
</I>&gt;<i> and its length in bytes. (Note that this is with a UCS-2 stream; the
</I>&gt;<i> multiply-by-two operations are because each UCS-2 character occupies
</I>&gt;<i> 2 bytes.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Inspecting the values of the variables revealed that while under 3.0,
</I>&gt;<i> token-&gt;start was a character index (the number of characters, not
</I>&gt;<i> bytes, relative to the start of the stream), in 3.0.1 it is an
</I>&gt;<i> absolute pointer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Similarly, where token-&gt;stop was a character index in 3.0 (the number
</I>&gt;<i> of characters, not bytes, relative to the start of the stream), in
</I>&gt;<i> 3.0.1 it is an absolute pointer as well. Strangely, it is not a
</I>&gt;<i> pointer to the end of the token text, but to the byte immediately
</I>&gt;<i> preceding it. In the case of UCS-2 that means that it's a pointer to
</I>&gt;<i> the second half of a character and isn't valid. Although this is
</I>&gt;<i> correct for ASCII streams, it seems like a bug for UCS-2 streams.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is, whereas in 3.0 given a character &quot;a&quot; at address 0x0f00:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - let's say stream-&gt;data is 0x0f00
</I>&gt;<i> - token-&gt;start is 0
</I>&gt;<i> - token-&gt;stop is 1
</I>&gt;<i> - the token's address is 0x0f00 + 0
</I>&gt;<i> - and its length is 1 * 2 (2 bytes)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But in 3.0.1:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - let stream-&gt;data be 0x0f00
</I>&gt;<i> - token-&gt;start is now 0x0f00
</I>&gt;<i> - token-&gt;stop is 0x0f01
</I>&gt;<i> - the token's address is 0x0f00
</I>&gt;<i> - and its length is (stop + 1) - start
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I was able to get my recognizer running by changing:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    start = (const char *)(stream-&gt;data + (token-&gt;start * 2));
</I>&gt;<i>    len   = (token-&gt;stop - token-&gt;start + 1) * 2;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    start = (const char *)token-&gt;start;
</I>&gt;<i>    len = (token-&gt;stop + 1 - token-&gt;start);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jim, is there anywhere where this kind of API-level change is
</I>&gt;<i> documented in the release notes? It would be nice if this kind of
</I>&gt;<i> information were included with future releases (or if it is already
</I>&gt;<i> included, it would be nice if the info were made more prominent).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another thing is that although the behaviour of the API changed, the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation in the header files did not. The start field in
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;antlr3commontoken.h&quot; is still documented as being &quot;The character
</I>&gt;<i> offset in the input stream where the text for this token starts.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I spent several hours last night trying to find the changeset which
</I>&gt;<i> introduced these changes and I had little success. In the spirit of
</I>&gt;<i> constructive criticism, there are a couple of things you could do to
</I>&gt;<i> make the development history easier to search:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - in many changesets the commit message describes what sounds like a
</I>&gt;<i> limited fix but the actual diff includes very extensive whitespace
</I>&gt;<i> fixes; this makes it much harder to see the actual substantive change
</I>&gt;<i> underneath all the cosmetic changes. Keeping your whitespace changes
</I>&gt;<i> in separate commits would be a huge help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - the same goes for spelling errors in comments; sometimes the number
</I>&gt;<i> of corrections drowns out the changes to the non-comment lines in the
</I>&gt;<i> source files. It would be great if you could keep such corrections in
</I>&gt;<i> separate changesets.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - often it seems that unrelated topics are bundled together in single
</I>&gt;<i> changesets, making it harder to understand the nature of the changes
</I>&gt;<i> because they're all mixed in together.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - the commit messages tend to be fairly brief and it can be quite
</I>&gt;<i> hard to figure out the purpose of a given changeset.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hope I haven't caused any offense with this feedback; I think I've
</I>&gt;<i> been spoilt lately by observing the Git development history. Check
</I>&gt;<i> out their changelog for a shining example of ultra-clean development
</I>&gt;<i> history:

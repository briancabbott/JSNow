Mwoch LL(2) isn't bad.. predicates are bad every ( ) =&gt; ( ) introduces
backtracking. And that is really expensive. With k=2 you can catch a lot.
If you do the factoring of your grammar religiously then you can circumvent
also a lot of backtracking at the expense of readability of your grammar
(in general).

Guess so.

I don't have any hard figures but I suspect it is better. I even recall
some posts in the past that said that flex was faster.

</I>&gt;<i> So having this we still can not get good scanner ?
</I>
We can have better codegen, but probably at the expense of some flexibility.
Also the codegenerator becomes more and more draconian to look at. I'd
prefer some rewriting...

 Why don't we just invite them to dinner and massacre them all when they're
  drunk? You heard the man. There's seven hundred thousand of them. Ah? ..
           So it'd have to be something simple with pasta, then.

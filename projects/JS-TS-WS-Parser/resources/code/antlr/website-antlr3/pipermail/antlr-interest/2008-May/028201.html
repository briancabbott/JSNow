<PRE>Thanks for the information, guys.

Johannes: I agree with you (in fact, as I said, I already am using
symbol tables, and already can successfully detect collisions). The
actual problem I'm facing (sorry if it wasn't clear) is that I don't
know the best way to report the error.

Pete: Good to see I'm not the only one to run into this! You are
right, it's a bit smelly, and it's also pretty similar to what I was
doing (minus the exit() call). I think the best bet at this point,
unless someone has a better suggestion, will be to throw a special
SemanticAnalysisException that stores a message about the type of
error. I will try that next. It still seems a bit smelly, since one of
the goals of the built-in RecognitionException &amp; friends is that they
don't store English strings, isn't it?

I would think that this kind of basic analysis &amp; error reporting is
pretty common in compilers, so I find it a bit surprising there's so
little information about the best technique!

Thanks again for the help,
Robin

&gt;<i> I agree - we need better documentation about how to report semantic errors

</I>&gt;<i> semantic errors like the one you describe.  Such errors should follow the
</I>&gt;<i> standard style, with a file name, line number and character number, so I use
</I>&gt;<i> these methods to report them:
</I>&gt;<i> public void errorMessage (TokenStream inp, String msg) {
</I>&gt;<i> String introString = &quot;&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i> if (!currentInputFileName.equals(&quot;&quot;)) {
</I>&gt;<i> int lineNbr = inp.LT(1).getLine();

</I>&gt;<i> introString = currentInputFileName + &quot;(&quot; + lineNbr + &quot;:&quot; + charPosition +
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;): &quot;;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> System.err.println(introString + msg);
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> public void dieWithMessage (TokenStream inp, String msg) {
</I>&gt;<i> errorMessage(inp, msg);
</I>&gt;<i>        System.exit(1);
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> which I call with, like,
</I>&gt;<i> dieWithMessage(input, &quot;class &quot; + classNam + &quot; undefined&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> This &quot;works&quot; but smells bad:
</I>&gt;<i>     1. It needs a global &quot;currentFileName&quot;, which changes when there are
</I>&gt;<i> includstream.
</I>&gt;<i>     2. The methods take a TokenStream to get the line number and character
</I>&gt;<i> position.  From reading ANTLR-generated code, I figured out that &quot;input&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> the token stream.  Perhaps I should pass in the token itself (input.LT(1))
</I>&gt;<i> instead of the whole stream.
</I>&gt;<i>     3. It doesn't use exceptions, which seems wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>     4. Related to #3, it calls System.exit(), which makes unit testing
</I>&gt;<i> difficult.
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully, this code will provoke enough disgust in better minds that
</I>&gt;<i> they'll post superior approaches :-)

</I>&gt;<i> Howdy all,

</I>&gt;<i> I've been using ANTLR for a little while now and it has been mostly

</I>&gt;<i> parser which generates ASTs, and tree grammar to pretty-print the
</I>&gt;<i> ASTs. So, my app works great as nothing more than a pretty printer at
</I>&gt;<i> this point, but it's a step, at least.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I started implementing code to perform some basic static type

</I>&gt;<i> I am able to access the type information. This I got working as
</I>&gt;<i> expected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I ran into a snag when attempting to do some error reporting. For the
</I>&gt;<i> purposes of this question, I'll show you a snippet of target code
</I>&gt;<i> (it's in a C-like syntax):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> int foo;
</I>&gt;<i> int bar;
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>    int foo; // This is valid, as it's in a different scope than the foo

</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> int foo; // This is illegal, as the variable &quot;foo&quot; in the same scope
</I>&gt;<i> is being redeclared.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a method, boolean isDefined(String identifier), which works as
</I>&gt;<i> expected to catch this error (for example, if I embed a
</I>&gt;<i> System.err.println() action). However, I cannot figure out the best
</I>&gt;<i> approach to report the error!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've perused the book and website to find a solution, and searched the
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list briefly, to no avail. I can use semantic predicates, but
</I>&gt;<i> the resulting error messages are next-to-useless. Has anyone tackled
</I>&gt;<i> this problem before, and if so, what's the recommended path for
</I>&gt;<i> reporting semantic errors (without sem preds, if possible)? I really
</I>&gt;<i> appreciate any help that can be provided.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!

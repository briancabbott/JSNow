Howdy,
I have finally figured out the grammar for a simple language I was given to
translate into java.
I have the lexer and parser, I am setting the function calls and operators
to be roots in the AST,
but I have not created a treewalker, and I have a few questions:
1) (It would be best to use a description to understand the question) let's
say I had a
expression of the form 1 + f(2,3,4). Given that the + and the f would be
ASTnode roots -i.e., in the parser grammar - and I wish to execute the
actions related
to the root nodes.
 I specified them as caret(^) tokens - If I apply an action to the 'f' node
that executed the function f(2,3,4), would the next step be to replace the
'f' node with the return value of the function so that the equation could
continue to be executed? If so, then how (code would be appreciated)
 - I am assuming a tree of the form
                    --+--
                    |    |
                    1    f
                         |
                         2-3-4
I will be parsing expressions of the form f(p) where p could be a simple
expression or complex expression containing nested functions
2) each ASTNode has a value, a type, and a list. My question is about the
type (ttype); Does it represent standard java StreamTokenizer types,
standard atomic types,  or does it represent the types you specify in your
lexer or parser??

3) Are there any good treewalker tutorials out there?

Yes, thats true.

But that's the reality. As Antlr licence is compatible with GPL, there is no 
conflict -- the stronger one (i.e. GPL) applies.

&gt;<i> Okay, so Antlr's licence is GPL-compatible so in practice there is no

I can ignore Antlr's licence since it has none (it's in PD). But if Antlr 
had some (stupid) licence disallowing GPLin the resulting

It depends on your licence. If it disallows GPL redistribution then 
hypothetical Antlr with your addon is unuseable for GPL code.

&gt;<i> Are you saying that your GPL licence trumps my licence?
</I>
The effect is then unlicenceable at all until some party loosens the constrains.

But it's academic discussion. Even closed source commercial tools usually 
have apropriate non-constrainig licences for the pieces of code getting into 
the generated results of their tools (with exceptions of some restricted 
editions, like educational, evaluation or similar)

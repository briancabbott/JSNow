<PRE>The following is extracted from Andrew W Appel's book Modern Compiler 
Implementation in Java, Second Edition, section 15.3 page 304. I do not 
understand the built-in type &quot;answer&quot;. Besides the following 
paragraphs, no other explanation was given in this book. It seems that 
continuation i/o and the type answer is supposed known to his readers 
as backgroud knowledge; but I have no ideas about it. 

Could anyone tell me relevant links or tutorials, course notes, etc 
talking about the type. I want to know what it is and how it is 
implemented. 


Thanks in advance.

CONTINUATION-BASED I/O 
Producing new data structures instead of updating old ones makes it 
possible to obey the &quot;no assignments&quot; rules, but how is the program to 
do input/output? The technique of continuation-based I/O expresses 
input/output in a functional framework. As shown in Program 15.4, the 
predefined types and functions in PureFunJava rely on the notion of an 
answer: This is the &quot;result&quot; returned by the entire program. 


PROGRAM 15.4: Built-in types and functions for PureFunJava. 


type answer // a special, built-in type 
type intConsumer = int -&gt; answer 
type cont = () -&gt; answer 

class ContIO 
{ 
    public answer readByte (intConsumer c); 
    public answer putByte (int i, cont c); 
    public answer exit(); 
} 


MiniJava doesn't have an input function, but if it did, the type would 
be straightforward: something like int readByte(). To express this 
without side effects, PureFunJava's readByte takes an argument that is 
a int-Consumer and passes the newly read integer to that consumer. 
Whatever answer the consumer produces will also be the answer of the 
readByte. 

Similarly, putByte takes a character to print as well as a continuation 
(cont); putByte outputs a character and then calls the cont to produce 
an answer. 


The point of these arrangements is to allow input/output while 
preserving equational reasoning. Interestingly, input/output is now 
&quot;visible&quot; to the typechecker: Any function which does I/O will have 
answer in its result type.

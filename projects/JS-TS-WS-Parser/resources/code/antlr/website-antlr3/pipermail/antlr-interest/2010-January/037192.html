<PRE>Thanks, folks.

David-Sarah makes a good point, which I would make perhaps just a bit
differently, and this is I see the interpreter as a kind of learning
tool, a crutch if you will.  If it goes wonky in a way that makes it
obvious to a knave that it's at fault, fine.  But if it goes wonky in
a way which causes the student to wonder, &quot;Is this me, or is this the
tool?&quot; then learning is impeded at a critical juncture, even if the
ultimate resolution (assuming a persistent student) does produce
deeper insight.

Note: I manage a commercial software development group serving highly
specialized engineering customers.  More than one customer has told me
that he or she would rather have &quot;a tool that fails in an obvious way&quot;
more often than &quot;a tool which fails in an ambiguous way less often.&quot;
{Quotes added to assist parsing.  :) }  It's not about being right or
wrong.  It's about knowing when you can trust your tools, and when you
shouldn't.

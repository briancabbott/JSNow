<PRE>I'd like to build a preprocessor to create a much cleaner, less  
verbose version of Java. I'm not sure if ANTLR can do this for me ..  
sorta a preprocessor from a &quot;java--&quot; to java. If it can, PLEASE send  
along a few pointers to me, a newbie!

Here's the story:

I've been following the JVM &quot;agile&quot; languages: Groovy, JRuby, Jython.  
Although I've very much enjoyed using them, I've also been impressed  
with the improvements in Java itself, especially with Java 1.5.

Although I like the agile languages, it's my impression that just  
simplifying Java itself would be good enough for me. These three  
sites capture the sort of thing I'd like to achieve:

They all address verbosity and warts in Java fairly nicely.

I'm convinced that a preprocessor could handle these, translating  
simplifications of Java into standard Java. I mean, how hard could it  
be to introduce raw strings and multi-line strings, right? Maybe  
something like python/groovy strings would do the trick. So:
   r&quot;\n\r&quot; -&gt; &quot;\\n\\r&quot; in Java and
&quot;&quot;&quot;
This is a multi line string
with newlines.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
   -&gt;
&quot;This is a multi line string\n&quot;+&quot;with newlines.\n&quot;

Reducing the verbosity of declarations should fairly reasonable:
Java:
   Foo&lt;T&gt; foo = new Foo&lt;T&gt;(a,b,c);
Simplified to:
   Foo&lt;T&gt; foo = new(a,b,c);
or
   foo := Foo&lt;T&gt;(a,b,c);

The biggest simplification I'm thinking about would be for one-method  
interfaces generally used an anonymous inner classes. [Google for  
Functor to see great examples. Closures also capture the idea.]
So in Java, you define a method in a class:
   ApplyExec(List&lt;T&gt;, Exec&lt;T&gt;);
.. that uses a simple interface:
   interface Exec&lt;T&gt; {
     void exec(T t);
   }
It would be called like this in Java:
   ApplyExec(myTList, new Exec&lt;T&gt;(){
       void exec(T t) {
         t.foo = t.bar + 7;
       }
   })
I'd prefer a very simple:
   ApplyExec(myTList,{t|t.foo = t.bar + 7})
Note that this captures the feel of a dynamic call, but it really is  
not, its a simple anonymous inner class shorthand. This would need  
either a name convention or a bit more information or both to work  
without building a fairly sophisticated parser. But still, you get  
the idea.

So is this something we could do easily in ANTLR??  If so, how!?

Thanks

<PRE>Hey Sam, thanks! I'm using it now and it's faster. Love the VS tool-chain!
I'd be dead in the water without it. And haven't bumped into any bugs with
the new version. So cool!

I've bummed into a slightly different problem and no matter how I arrange my
grammar (included) I can't seem to work around it. I think it might be a bug
in the SpecialStateTransition logic...

Below is what I'm trying to parse along with the trace using your enter-exit
partial methods (wonderful addition BTW) for my C# preprocessor interleaved
with when the tokens get pulled from the stream. Also interleaved are my
calls to toggle SkipSection which is trying to keep track of when code is
#ifdefed out. So what we see is that [#if] is pulled and then [false] and
[\r\n]. At that point in the parse I'm at the end of the pre-processor line
and so I look up the pp_conditional stack to see if I'm in a #ifdefed out
section of code. In this case I am so I set SkipSection to True. That
enables (via semantic predicate) my lexer rule
PP_SKIPPED_CHARACTERS=45 which should suck up any code that is not a pragma
statement (doesn't start with #). That's all well and good and so the next
thing that get tokenized is [#pragma warning disable] which is good.

Now at this point I expect that no tokens should get pulled until I reach
the pp_pragma production. I expect this because I figure ANLTER should be
able to predict where it needs to go without pulling any more tokens --
after all the only thing that can follow a [#pragma warning disable] token
is a list of integers. The actual behavior is that in my
pp_condition_section production ANTLR pulls [10] as a
PP_SKIPPED_CHARACTERS instead of an INTEGER because SkipSection is set to
True. If things had gone as expected and [10] had been pulled in the
pp_pragma production. If that had happened then SkipSection would have been
set to False and [10] would be pulled as an INTEGER.

The code that's actually pulling the [10] is DFA.Predict in the
SpecialStateTransition loop when trying to predict where to go for the
pp_conditional_section production:

pp_conditional_section
:<i> { !SkipSection }? =&gt; input_section
</I>|<i> { SkipSection }? =&gt; pp_skipped_section
</I>;

I'm guessing that this production is &quot;special&quot; because it's got those gated
semantic predicates and that's why DFA.Predict enters into the
SpecialStateTransition logic. What I don't understand is why it would need
to pull any more tokens to know where to go next. Do you think that's a bug
that it's pulling tokens in this case?

After writing this e-mail it occurred to me that I might manually try to do
the prediction. I did this by putting a break point in the
pp_conditional_section rule at the dfa.Predict line. But instead of asking
the DFA to do the prediction I just set-ip to the case I wanted (e.g. {...}?
=&gt; pp_skipped_section). Then hit F5. And it works! I included the trace of
that run below. Given that I really do think that the SpecialStateTransition
logic (or there abouts) is being to aggressive about pulling tokens... what
do you think?

Thanks,
Chris

<PRE>I think that there is one place where the generated code is not quite
correct &#8211; something to do with tree parser output. Can you post the error
you are getting or send me the grammar files?

we are using antlr 3.1.1 - and yes we did compile the runtime libs with the
enable 64 bit.

The libs compile fine and link with our application code fine; When did not
have the enable 64 bit the link against our application code would fail
because the libs were built in 32 bit.



May be I should try with 3.3 (the latest version of antlr).

thank you

Did you set the enable-64bit flag when you built the runtime? Did you use
the latest release? It is 64 bit compatible and ANTLR_MARKER is 64 bits when
you build the runtime for 64 bits. Sounds like you built it with the default
32 bits.

Well the generated code is using ANTLR_UINT32 variable and is assigning
ANTLR_MARKER type value to it; this doesn't work on 64 bit. So I was
wondering if the generated C code is dependent on 32 vs 64 bit.



Is there a way to make it use UINT64 instead of UINT32?



thanks

1) What file is this and from where?
2) These days you can just rename it to a .g file, the extension names
were because older versions of Visual Studio needed it to see what the
output files were but that isn't relevant any more.
3) The generated C is the same on all platforms and there is nothing
special to do to generate 64 but, 32 bit, Linux, Win32, Solaris etc. In
fact it is designed so that you can generate the C on one platform and
compile it on any. I had to do that because HPUX Java (and HPUX in
general) sucks and could not even run the ANTLR tool jar without patching
the kernel.

So, just like any other file you run the ANTLR tool on it and it will give
you a .c and .h file. The generated files are both 32 and 64 bit
compatible but if you read the docs for the C runtime it will point you at
./configure --help where you will see a flag that you supply to build the
libraries in 64 bit mode.

As to searching all over the interweb, look at the API documentation link
on the ANTLR home page and remember antlr.markmail.org as per the link on
the support page.

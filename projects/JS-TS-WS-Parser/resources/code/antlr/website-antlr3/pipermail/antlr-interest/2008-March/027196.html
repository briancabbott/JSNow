I had the same experience. However, the architectual impliciations
behind action code creeped me out even more, so I kept looking :P

</I>
Could this be a tool-level solution? Parse the grammar
file, and automatically insert basic AST-rewrite rules to achieve the
same effect? The benefit of this is that it involves no additional
magic on ANTLR's part, and would be easier to customize if it turns
out that the grammar rules are best arranged in one way but the AST is best
arranged in another.

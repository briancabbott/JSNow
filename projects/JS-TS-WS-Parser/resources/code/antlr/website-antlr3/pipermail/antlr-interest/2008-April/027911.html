The synpreds themselves are only being generated because you have 
backtrack=true, so it's trying to hoist the predicate far enough 
to figure out whether it should be going down that path before it 
bothers trying (and possibly throwing an exception, which is bad 
for performance).

&gt;<i>By the way, why do you refer the flag in the predicate with

</I>
That's because you're supposed to refer to parameters (and return 
values, and labels, etc) that way, because the code generator is 
free to rename it if it wants to.

This error is actually telling you that the predicate is being 
hoisted somewhere where it won't work -- if you turn off 
backtracking (so that it doesn't create a synpred to hoist your 
sempred into), then this error goes away as well.

Anyway, going back to your original grammar, there's another 
problem with it (which is presumably why you added backtracking in 
the first place).  In rule &quot;r&quot;, you have a common left prefix, 
which hurts performance and sometimes causes incorrect behaviour 
(when ANTLR can't look ahead far enough to resolve the 
ambiguity).  Removing this (and disabling backtracking) yields a 
working grammar:

grammar test;

options {
   output=AST;
   ASTLabelType=CommonTree;
   //backtrack=true;
   //memoize=true;
}

tokens {
   NODE;
}

r : Token1^
     ( Token2! r2[true]
     | r2[false]
     )
   ;

r2[boolean flag]
   : Token1
     ( {$flag}? -&gt; ^(NODE Token1)
     | -&gt; Token1
     )
   ;

Token1 : 'TOKEN1';
Token2 : 'TOKEN2';


However even with this version, if backtracking is turned on then 
the parameter will get hoisted inappropriately again.  It looks 
like using scopes is the only answer after all, if you want to 
keep the backtracking and this particular rule structure.

I'm not really sure why it still wants to hoist it in this case, 
since it has no bearing on the actual decision tree.

Of course, another option is to remove the parameter altogether:

r : Token1^
     ( Token2! r2
     | Token1
     )
   ;

r2 : Token1 -&gt; ^(NODE Token1) ;

<PRE>Dear ANTLR users! (developers?)

I have a very basic problem: supposed I have two rules, one which 
basically includes any token, and another one that contains only a 
subset of them, say:

any : A | B | C | D ;
some
    : A B
    | B
    ;

Now, I want to combine those two rules:

rule     : ( options{ greedy=false;} : any )+ some      ;

.. such that the inner loop should consume any's, as long as LA(1)!=B &amp;&amp; 
(LA(1)!=A||LA(2)!=B). This should be easily recognizable by the parser 
(in my opinion). However, ANTLR 3 (3.1.2) says:

warning: Decision can match input such as &quot;A B&quot; using multiple 
alternatives: 1, 2

Note that when I change the rule &quot;some&quot; to:

some : A | B;

such that only a lookahead of one character is enough, everything works 
as expected: &quot;any&quot; is consumed until a character is found from the 
difference &quot;any-some&quot;.

Now, I thought &quot;ok, use backtracking&quot;. Enabling it globally seems to 
work. But, if I try to enable it only locally, it does not seem to have 
any effect. Actually, I tried to enable it for any rule in my grammar - 
without any effect! (I include the grammar in question as attachement)

What can I do? Thanks for any hints!

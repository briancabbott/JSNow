</I>Hmm. I guess I just don't see it.
A List of Person objects doesn't get much harder when the Person class
has a &quot;Person mom&quot; field. Sure, you can accidentally create a cycle, but
you can also accidentally make the same mistake with a List (e.g.
having a &quot;next&quot; pointer in a linked list point somewhere invalid, like
to itself).
  


&gt;<i> For lang X to X, morphing trees 
</I>&gt;<i> is ok but altering language makes each new pass have to match a new kind 
</I>&gt;<i> of tree. 
</I>
No, it doesn't. There is no &quot;new kind of tree&quot; - it stays a tree data structure
always. It's the ANTLR treewalker implementation that makes it seem like there's
&quot;something new&quot; going on. The &quot;shape&quot; of the tree is changing, just as any
other data structure's &quot;shape&quot; changes over time. It's the ANTLR treewalker
forcing you to provide a &quot;snapshot&quot; of that evolving shape that's making
it seem like the tree is somehow now of &quot;a new kind of tree&quot;.

&gt;<i> lang X to Y is not so good as a result.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now imagine the same program working on a tree rather than a list.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Same situation: the program changes the shape of the tree lots of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> times in lots of ways, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> having to specify the &quot;shape&quot; of it after every change would be silly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's the situation when trying to use treewalkers in a translator.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's just that the silliness isn't apparent until you get beyond
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just a couple of valid tree &quot;shapes&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's why I said I am liking the text rewrite approach; the approach 
</I>&gt;<i> you are using, no?
</I>
Yes.

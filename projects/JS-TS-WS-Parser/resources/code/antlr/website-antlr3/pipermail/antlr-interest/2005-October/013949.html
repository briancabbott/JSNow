<PRE>&gt;<i> My first problem (which I have resolved) was that the parser 
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't handle macro code at all. so something like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> class MY_API FooBar {
</I>&gt;<i> //code here
</I>&gt;<i> };
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> would cause exceptions to be thrown. I found a preprocessor 
</I>&gt;<i> library which seems to work quite well, that can replace 
</I>&gt;<i> these macros with their real values.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can create my custom code graph from this modified text. 
</I>&gt;<i> Each node in this graph contains the line it's on, and it's 
</I>&gt;<i> column, or start position.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So now I have another problem, which I am hoping folks here 
</I>&gt;<i> may have some ideas about how best to tackle:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All the line/col positions are based on the *modified*, 
</I>&gt;<i> pre-processed code. Ideally I want this information so that I 
</I>&gt;<i> can use it, say, to position the cursor at a given position 
</I>&gt;<i> in the editor, or to replace/modify a chunk of text that 
</I>&gt;<i> corresponds to that node. But the &quot;real&quot; positions need to be 
</I>&gt;<i> based on the original code, so I need some sort of 
</I>&gt;<i> translation back from one (parsed code) to the other (original code).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Has anyone done anything like this? Is there a better way to 
</I>&gt;<i> tackle this?
</I>
Depends on whether you need to tackle arbitary codebases or just code that
you have some control over. For sane code without extreme macro-isms (e.g.
Akilesh's CONCAT sample), you can parse the unpreprocessed code into a graph
that maintains both the macro definitions and their uses (with links between
them). Thus for any given set of compile-time symbols, you can generate the
preprocessed text. This implies that your graph must be able to support
multiple definitions for any given symbol.

I define sane code as code that would parse correctly if the preprocessor
#xxx lines were deleted. For some classes of insane code, it may be possible
to write a filter that converts the insane code to sane code by sanitizing
the use of macros.

&gt;<i> Is there a way to modify the orignal C++ grammar 
</I>&gt;<i> to just skip over the macros entirely (this would be great, 
</I>&gt;<i> as it would get around the whole issue).
</I>
Perhaps but (as per my response above), the source code that remains after
excising/ignoring macros may not be legal C++.

Cheers,

Micheal

<PRE>Thanks for your help.

I had hoped that the &quot;bad&quot; token could be handled by a catch block 
somewhere.  The &quot;somewhere&quot; part may be the catch.  It appears to me 
that the normal behavior of an antlr parser is to report an 
unexpected token, and then to forge ahead.  That's the behavior I 
observe if I place a token (or rather a string that will match a 
known lexer rule) in the wrong spot in my input.  The parser reports 
it as an unexpected token, but continues to parse.  That is the 
behavior that I want to use by returning a &quot;special&quot; token unknown to 
any parser rule. I do not (yet) understand just where and how the 
normal processing happens in the parser code - I'm busy looking 
through it to find out, especially as regards exception handling.  
Any hints on this would help, although I am also re-reading the docs 
on exceptions.

The main thing that would make life easier for me is if I can 
identify a single spot to handle the information about source of 
tokens.  That is, it would be a pain in the neck if such processing 
had to be associated with each parser rule separately.  I'm not sure 
if I am being clear about that.

The other two strategies that you suggest (hidden token stream; 
embedding file information in the token) may also be fruitful for me, 
so I'll look into both. Thanks for the excellent insights.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [antlr-interest] catching an exception in the parser and
</I>&gt;<i> continuing - will this work?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am handling &quot;include files&quot; in my lexer, as in the java example 
</I>&gt;<i> provided with antlr.  This means that fact the lexer is in an 
</I>&gt;<i> included file is transparent to the parser.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, it turns out that I want the parser to be made aware of 
</I>the 
&gt;<i> fact that the lexer is in an included file. (Kindly assume that I 
</I>&gt;<i> have a sound design reason for this ;-) Given the amount of 
</I>lookahead 
&gt;<i> that may occur, I am sure that the only safe way to do this is by 
</I>&gt;<i> putting the correct &quot;notification&quot; on the stream of tokens passed 
</I>to 
&gt;<i> the parser.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is it possible to have the lexer pass a back a &quot;bad&quot; token (i.e. 
</I>one 
&gt;<i> that the parser can never recognize), catch a resultant exception, 
</I>&gt;<i> and then (here's the important part) force the parser to take up 
</I>&gt;<i> right where is was when it got the &quot;bad&quot; token?  It would amount to 
</I>&gt;<i> skipping over the &quot;bad&quot; token, except that the exception handling 
</I>&gt;<i> code would set a flag or two that would be available later to 
</I>parser 
&gt;<i> semantic actions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have looked at the exception handling documentation, and sifted 
</I>&gt;<i> through my generated parser.  It is not clear to me if my strategy 
</I>&gt;<i> will work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, I am still using antlr 2.7.1 - I want to try to finish what I 
</I>am 
&gt;<i> doing before trying the switch to 2.7.2.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks.

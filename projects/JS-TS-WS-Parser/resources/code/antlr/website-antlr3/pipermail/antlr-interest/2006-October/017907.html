</I>&gt;<i> Ok, so a sort of semantic predicates in grammars, only that it is not  
</I>&gt;<i> in a grammar, but in hand-written code. Of course, it is using some  
</I>&gt;<i> sort of grammar anyway, because your rule engine still uses a kind of  
</I>&gt;<i> language.
</I>

Yes, but a simple one: the &quot;v&quot; and &quot;x&quot; placeholders are all there is to 
it. Everything else
is matched literally. So far simpler (and more limited) than ANTLR or 
even regular expressions.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I totally agree with you on that point. Having a tool available is so  
</I>&gt;<i> much better in any craft. It's hard to understand why some people  
</I>&gt;<i> cannot see the value of that. I mean having a compiler still doesn't  
</I>&gt;<i> write programs for you, but it saves you from all the nitty gritty  
</I>&gt;<i> details you don't want to bother with. Funnily enough, in other areas  
</I>&gt;<i> they do accept that: see garbage collection for one thing. Nowadays  
</I>&gt;<i> everyone jumps onto that train. It ain't perfect in many cases, but  
</I>&gt;<i> it will help you to get your work done sooner. Same applies to your  
</I>&gt;<i> project. And incidentally the same applies to IDE's, too. At least  
</I>&gt;<i> that's slowly changing. I don't want to go back to vi to edit my  
</I>&gt;<i> projects. Too. Much. Hassle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kudos for trying to change that!
</I>
The problem is that people value program correctness over readability. 
Crazy as it sounds, I prefer this program:
System.out.println(&quot;hello, world&quot;)
...over this one...
System.out.print(&quot;he&quot; + 'l' + &quot;l&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;o&quot;);

The first one is clean but incorrect, the second one is correct but not 
clean.
The first one will be much easier to maintain over time. Same for 
million-line programs...I think it's better
to have something that's well written than something that's completely 
bug-free!

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not an expert in linguistics, far from it, so I can't really  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> say  anything for NLP.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yea, me neither. I was pretty shocked at how different the NLP  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> approaches are from &quot;compiler&quot; approaches.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Seemed like zero overlap. I'm still pretty shocked at how bad NLP  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seems to be, but I guess I have just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one data point: babelfish.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the real problem with NLP vs. most artificial languages is:  
</I>&gt;<i> You do not need to declare objects before usage in natural languages.  
</I>&gt;<i> We don't go around pre-declaring everything we want to talk or write  
</I>&gt;<i> about. Also, natural languages are much more ambiguous and highly  
</I>&gt;<i> context sensitive. Furthermore, the semantics of a word or phrase can  
</I>&gt;<i> depend highly of intonation if you are dealing with speech. And last  
</I>&gt;<i> but not least, natural language can grossly violate grammatical rules  
</I>&gt;<i> and still be understood. 
</I>
It's even worse than that. There may not exist a &quot;correct&quot; solution 
(&quot;who does the 'he' refer to in some sentence...no
way to know for sure&quot;). And there can be exceptions that no one would 
ever think of until they hit them
(&quot;the White House&quot; is still &quot;the White House&quot; in Spanish, not &quot;Casa 
Blanca&quot;, and to know that you need to now political-type things!).
Not to mention wackyness like &quot;Go&quot; is a valid sentence, with an implied 
&quot;You&quot; as the verb.
Or &quot;this is a sentence, but the period goes OUTSIDE the quotes&quot;.

&gt;<i> This is not generally the case with  artificial languages.
</I>
Generally, but then again, it's 10pm, and my officemate is looking at a 
line of code like this:
typedef char MYCHAR[25];
...which of course tells us replace any occurances of &quot;MYCHAR&quot; with 
&quot;char[25]&quot;.
The good news is that it turns out we already saw that once, and handle 
it :)

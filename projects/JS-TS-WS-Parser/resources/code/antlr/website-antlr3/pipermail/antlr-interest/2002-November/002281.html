Ric--

My tree rewrite support does use the dup methods, and that will get 
folded in at some point.  They are needed--in some tree grammars, it 
is desirable to recognize anything (&quot;.&quot;) and then do a dupTree for the 
output copy--and they would otherwise need to be AST methods.

Micheal--

Backward links in a tree (or cross-links, for that matter) are 
incompatible with tree-rewriting and would be bad news for any 
tree-transformaing tree grammar.  Setting them would have to be 
deferred until the final syntax tree is constructed or the developer 
would have to add some significant machinery to deal with them, so 
this is probably a non-issue.

In a implicitly garbage-collected language, the &quot;dup&quot; methods only 
need to support deep cloning of the AST structure (right and down 
fields), I believe.  Any other pointers can probably be 
inherited--they are not part of the tree structure and would be passed 
unchanged through syntax tree transformation unless explicitly 
modified in actions.

I suspect that Ric's reason for cloning other fields in ASTs is 
because of the explicit garbage collection problem--adding smart 
pointers for strings takes up just as much space as does a copy of the 
string object and costs in terms of maintainability.

ANTLR always copies during tree transformation--the memory cost is 
there already.

&gt;<i>

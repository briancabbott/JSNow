I'm secretly planning to allow all sorts of cool stuff like parsers 
that can handle single char tokens w/o going to the lexer and so on.  
Having the parser at runtime be able to distinguish char from token 
type just by looking at the value was going to be mighty handy.

In the previous version, I made a number of decisions based upon the 
current state of the art in CPU speed / architecture, which of course 
changes pretty damn fast.  I wonder if we shouldn't just go 64 bit for 
the token types leaving a full 32-bits for characters and for token 
types all within the same value.  Who knows, this may also make some 
other things convenient.  What if we could encode the TokenStream 
channel in the token type so we can &quot;tune&quot; to only certain channels?  
What if we had special tokens other than EOF?  Perhaps there will be a 
need.

Hmm...I wonder how fast 64-bit processors will become the norm (G5s are 
there and AMD is too, right?)?  How horrible does Java do 64-bit ints 
now for comparison and other rot?  ANTLR 3.0 won't be available for a 
while...perhaps 64 bits ain't that bad an idea.  BTW, passing around 
another variable is unwieldly coding wise and will just be two 32-bit 
ints anyway, right?

Too bad I don't have #define or a typename I could use so the actual 
type could be changed later.  Would be nice to see LabelType instead of 
int.

Thanks for the ideas...

Ter

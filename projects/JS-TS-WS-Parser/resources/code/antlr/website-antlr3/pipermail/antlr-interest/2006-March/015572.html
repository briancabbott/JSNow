Prashant  and I are going to be  publishing a paper on this soon so I  
would work on something else. ;)

Perhaps evaluating rewrite systems for v3 like

&quot;int &lt;ID&gt; = &lt;expr&gt;;&quot; -&gt; &quot;int &lt;ID&gt;;\n&lt;ID&gt; = &lt;expr&gt;;&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> Keep at it

</I>
  thanks for the encouragement.  I memorized the keyboard and one  
point five hours but am having difficulty getting my efficiency up.  
Are you able to use emacs with the new keyboard too?

Ter

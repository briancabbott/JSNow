&quot;Public domain&quot; became a very grey area when the current copyright laws 
went into effect.  Now stuff is implicitly copyrighted.  From what I have 
read (I am not a lawyer), authors are protected against being able to put 
their work in the public domain.  You can transfer copyrights by notifying 
the copyright office in writing, but it is not clear that that applies to 
transferring copyrighted works into the public domain.  Right now, we can 
be sure that ANTLR will be public domain 70 years after the death of all 
contributors; whether it is or is not right now is another question.  Only 
the courts can say for sure.

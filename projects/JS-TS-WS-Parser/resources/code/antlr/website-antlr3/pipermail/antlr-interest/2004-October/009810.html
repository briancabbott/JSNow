Some nmake makefiles would be duly appreciated (since I can use those
myself with the commandline only free version) If you get me up to date
versions for the project for the current snapshot than I can include them
in the distro) (I removed all old files since they were way out of date)
And making a static lib from antlr is a nobrainer anyway with a recent
MSVC. Only DLL's cause trouble.

They suck ;) could be a magnitude faster with some serious hacking on them.
The new antlr3 code will be way *way* better.

Ter has this delusion about java ;) So it's java. (for he rest this
discussion is pointless) For the generator it's not that bad. As long as
the generated code is ok. MINGW fixes the java runtime dependency and the
configure build builds a mingw executable nearly out of the box, now only a
installer....

AFAIK we'll have C and C++ targets next to java for the codegenerators and
with the new string template stuff it's easy (or easier) to add new ones. I
was able to make a prototype C codegenerator in 2 days, without actually
knowing how stringtemplate works.

Cheers,

Ric

  &quot;I think we better split up.&quot;
  &quot;Good idea. We can do more damage that way.&quot;

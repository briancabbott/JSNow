<PRE>Hiya,

I've  then speaking with the awesome people at stack exchange and they were okay with me pointing the support list at

<A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/antlr">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/antlr</A> 

rather than using the mailing list. Well, we would have to phase it out or something and keep the archives available. Part of the issue is that people use both at the moment. there is no single place to go for questions.

Basically, I'm trying to reduce my system administration load. I've turned off p4 in favor of github and have turned off jira in favor of github's bug tracker.  I tried to move the confluence wiki to the on demand service, but I'm not sure it's ready for prime time yet so I backed off.

Moving to that website has a lot of advantages over an old-school mailing list, if you've ever used it. You can also treat it like a mailing list by asking for events when someone posts an antlr-tagged posting. It's set up very nicely for question-and-answer. It's also easier for people to post a question because they don't have to sign up for our mailing list. there is a good chance that they will have an account already at stackoverflow.com

Does anybody see any bears in the woods that I'm not? issues? those in favor?

Ter
</PRE>

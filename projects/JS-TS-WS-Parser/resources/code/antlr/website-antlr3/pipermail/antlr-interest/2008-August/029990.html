<PRE>Unfortunately, the official SQL language is a monster, right
up there with C++ in complexity (IMO). I have a translator that
converts embedded SQL into equivalent Java JDBC calls, but it 
only works for simple SQL statements.

You're right to be afraid that your PL/SQL may have stuff that's not
handled by the example parsers. Again, same problems as C++ - the
standard is way too complex, each vendor (Oracle in this case)
implements their own non-standard features, and developers use those features.

Seems like writing a general PL/SQL - to - Java translator would take a
lifetime, but a translator that works only with your existing PL/SQL code might
be doable.

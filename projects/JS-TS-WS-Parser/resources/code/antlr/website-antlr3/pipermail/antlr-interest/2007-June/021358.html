<PRE>Hi.  Please be aware that the venue has changed: the new venue is in

Same time as already advertised: 6:00pm for beer and pizza, 6:30 start

---------------
Our speaker is Terence Parr, a professor of computer science and  
graduate program director at the University of San Francisco where he  
builds programming language tools such as ANTLR and StringTemplate.  
Terence has consulted for and held various technical positions at  
companies such as IBM, Lockheed Missiles and Space, NeXT, and Renault  
Automation.  Terence holds a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from  
Purdue University and was a postdoctoral fellow at the Army High- 
Performance Computing Research Center at the University of Minnesota  
where he built parallelizing FORTRAN source-to-source translators.

ANTLR is a popular public domain parser generator built in Java.  
ANTLR is used internally by many open source projects including  
Hibernate, JBoss, Checkstyle and many more. It is also used in many  
commercial tools such as IntelliJ IDEA, Clover, FishEye, BEA/ 
Weblogic, Apples iWeb, Tivoli and others.

Terence will give a brief introduction to ANTLR and the new features  
in the recently released v3. He'll then demonstrate ANTLR's ease of  
use in solving common parsing problems, including processing config  
file formats, designing and parsing DSLs, and processing/translating  
programming language source files. He'll also demonstrate ANTLRWorks,  
a sophisticated GUI development environment for writing and debugging  
ANTLR grammars.

<PRE>It appears now that it was not a compiler bug (aside from reporting the
error twice) but what appears to be an error in the construction of the *
Parser.cs file which uses a technique that not allowable in C# (but
allowable in Java, hence my confusion).  I am unable to put ANTLERWorks back
in the state where the generated parser inherits from DebugParser instead of
Parser, (and accidentally blew away that version of the file) so I will have
to relate from memory what the issue was with the generated code.

DebugParser has a field in it named dbg which is protected internal.
Somewhere in the generated *Parser.cs, when inheriting from DebugParser, a
field is defined that passes that inherited dbg to a constructor during
field initialization.  It looked something like this:

// inside generated parser class which inherits from DebugParser:

SomeType someField = new SomethingFromLib(dbg, someotherParam);

As I have just discovered, this type of field initialization that references
another field in the class (i.e. dbg) is not allowed in C# (though allowable
in Java, which I bet is the source of the confusion).  This initialization
must happen in the constructor (and when I moved it to the constructor the
file then compiled fine).  So the important thing to note is that, for
example:

class Foo
{
      Object dog = new Object();
      Object cat = dog; // this line will not compile with cryptic error
message, nor will any line that references dog e.g. &quot;new X(dog);&quot;

}

Is not an allowable C# program while:

class Foo
{
      Object dog = new Object();
      Object cat;

      public Foo()
      {
          cat = dog;
      }

}

is.

I think a good way to think about this is &quot;In C#, implicit (or explicit)
references to this or base (i.e. &quot;super&quot;) are not allowable in field
initializers.&quot;  Not sure why C# does this, but evidently it is the case.

Hope this helps.

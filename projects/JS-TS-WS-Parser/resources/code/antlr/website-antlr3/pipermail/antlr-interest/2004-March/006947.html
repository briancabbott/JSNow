<PRE>Don't worry :-)

I was responding to the previous poster to say that I was confused.

Now you're responding to me saying you're confused.

I think your sig about chaos winning (because it's better organised)
discusses this bit of the thead to a T :-)

Cheers,

Hi,

Interpreted!?!? Whoever said that ? I've always been under the
impression
that this would be a language-to-language translation. If performance is
an
aim for ANTLR 3 then interpreted is definitely not the way to go.

For C++ support in ANTLR 3 calling/interfacing java from C++ looks to me
personally a total non option. A tool requiring java for a generated
parser
targetted for C++, sounds like a tool I personally would give a very
wide
berth. Requiring java for development I can tolerate ;)

<PRE>Short version:

Please replace <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">ANTLR-INTEREST at yahagroups.com</A> with a _single mailing list_. Keep
things simple so that you (and we) can focus on improving ANTLR.

Long version:

Forums:  I hate web-based forums (the way Jive is normally used) so I hope that
you will replace yahoogroups with a mailing list. At the very least, allow us to
recieve messages in my email, allow us to post messages via email, and allow us
to reply to messages with our email programs' &quot;reply&quot; command.

Usually when people implement Jive they end up with a bunch of forums. I don't
see the value in that for ANTLR-INTEREST; I am not interested in every single
message that comes through currently, but I doubt you can divide up the messages
into forums that will allow me to say &quot;I am interested in forums A, B, and D but
I'll never care about anything in forums C and E.&quot; So, please make it convenient
to receive _all_ the ANTLR messages by email.

IMO, the worst thing about Yahoo Groups is the search feature; it is frustrating
to use (especially, its paging is completely useless and its threading is bad).
If the search interface didn't suck too badly I wouldn't care about the ads. But
is Jive's search better than Yahoo Groups'?

Blogs: Usually, there is a one-to-one relationship between a blog and a person.
I doubt many people (even you, Terence) are going to have a blog that is
completely about ANTLR. Why would you want antlr.org to host blogs that aren't
ANTLR-specific? There are so many blogging hosts out there right now, what is
the advantage to our &quot;ANTLR community&quot; to adding another one at antlr.org?
Personally, I'd rather see a read-only ANTLR 3 source code repository (perforce,
subversion, or cvs).

- Brian

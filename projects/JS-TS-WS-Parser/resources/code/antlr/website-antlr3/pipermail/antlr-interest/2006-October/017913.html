It's missing the semicolon :)

</I>
This is the mindset I'm trying to change...it's at the heart of what I'm
doing.
Every translator that I know of other than Jazillian goes for
correctness, and every one (that I've seen)
produces something like 50 lines of code from the one-line &quot;hello,
world&quot; program.
I could talk all day about why it's perfectly reasonable to allow bugs
to be introduced (as is done
every time a human writes or rewrites anything), but I'll spare you :)

&gt;<i> I think there's a tradeoff between  readability and correctness. 
</I>&gt;<i> Granted, I can live with border cases,  where the vendor says &quot;Listen, 
</I>&gt;<i> for constructs like malloc you have  triple-check the translation,

</I>&gt;<i> but these cases should be well defined  and clearly stated. OTOH I 
</I>&gt;<i> assume you do that sort of thing with your  customers.
</I>&gt;<i> That said, I value code cleanliness a lot, having worked on quite  
</I>&gt;<i> large projects, cleaned them up and seen them deteriorate again in  
</I>&gt;<i> the span of a couple of months. So I think I know what you mean.
</I>
In our case, we'll see if, say, a memset() call matches any patterns of
usage that we've seen before and have some
Java equivalent. If not, we'll leave it in the code, give a warning, and
you'll have a memset() call in the middle of your Java code.
So, obviously, our translator works much better on &quot;vanilla business
logic&quot; code than it does on low-level library code.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This is not generally the case with  artificial languages.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Generally, but then again, it's 10pm, and my officemate is looking  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at a line of code like this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> typedef char MYCHAR[25];
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...which of course tells us replace any occurances of &quot;MYCHAR&quot; with  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;char[25]&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes? That's the way typedefs work. Am I missing anything? How's that  
</I>&gt;<i> violating the grammar?
</I>
typedefs are usually of the form:
typedef THIS IS THE REPLACEMENT    THING_TO_BE_REPLACED;
this one is of the form:
typedef PART_OF_REPLACEMENT THING_TO_BE_REPLACED REST_OF_REPLACEMENT.

This illustrates the AST vs. token stream mentality really well. The &quot;oh
no!&quot; moment that I get when
I see this out-of-wack-token-sequence-meaning is a bad one. But  this
&quot;I'm going to
now have to think a bit to make sure I understand this&quot; thinking that
I'm experiencing here is very similar
to the &quot;I'm going to have to think now about what the AST looks like&quot;
feeling that I'd have to do ALL THE TIME
with ASTs.

Andy.

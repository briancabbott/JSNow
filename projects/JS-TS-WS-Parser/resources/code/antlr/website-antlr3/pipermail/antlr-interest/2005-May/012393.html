<PRE>I think this is the same topic; sorry if I misunderstood...

Some of us do software for a living, and we have signed something with
our employer saying &quot;all my software belong to you&quot; (more or less).

That means, using me as an example, that I cannot simply send a patch
to ANTLR; I have to get my employer to say it is &quot;a good thing&quot; to
contribute to ANTLR.

By saying Terence can blame me if my employer comes hunting for blood,
it gets him out of the middle.  He has a paper trail saying I told him
it was okay, so they can come hunting my head instead of Terence's.

Yes, there is F/OSS.  No, I can't blithely contribute to it - my
employer is paying for exclusive use.

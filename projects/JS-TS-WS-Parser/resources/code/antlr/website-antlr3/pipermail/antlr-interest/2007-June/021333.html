<PRE>Thanks, Michael for taking the time to respond to my problem.
 
However, I cannot find the lexer you are referring to on the antlr2
website. There are five C# references, four of them are described as
html files and it turns out they are ordinary text files (not your
fault, but seems pretty silly) some don't even have a lexer and I
can't find a  CSharpLexer.g anywhere.
 
I'm wondering whether you discounted your first suggestions in your
previous message because you thought they might not work or whether
you thought the example in the CSharpLexer.g would be clearer. Can I
take it that the suggestions you made first are still worth pursuing?
 
What was wrong with either of these two attempts of mine to stop the
nondetermism warning with ID?
 
AsmStatements
 :
 (options{generateAmbigWarnings = false;}:
 (&quot;__asm&quot;|&quot;_asm&quot;|&quot;asm&quot;) // etc.
 )
 ;

AsmStatements
 options{generateAmbigWarnings = false;}
 :
 (&quot;__asm&quot;|&quot;_asm&quot;|&quot;asm&quot;) // etc.
 ;
 
Thanks,
 
David Wigg

Ooops!. Scratch my comments about the 2.x examples using that idiom.
I'm
apprently remembering something else. The csharp_v1 example (only
available
for C# in v2.x) has a CSharpLexer.g file that you could look at
instead.

David,

Have you tried declaring your literals (i.e. &quot;__asm&quot;, &quot;_asm&quot;...etc)
using
the tokens {...} construct in ANTLR 2.x. You would then need to set
the
testLiterals option to 'true' for your ID rule. This ensures that all
match
ID strings are checked against your literals.

Many of the 2.x examples (e.g. the Java parser which is also available
in
C++) can serve as an example of this idiom. They declare keywords in
the
tokens {..} section and set the testLiterals option for their
ID/IDENT/IDENTIFIER rule.

Micheal

PS    Any plans to port your C++ grammar to v3?. The C target is
maturing
and is seems very performant.

Subject: [antlr-interest] ANTLR 2.7 Lexer problem


Thanks to those who replied to my lexer problem about coping with
whitespace
in the lexer described in Digest vol 31 issue 22 of 6 June. As
suggested
parsing specifically for white space solved this problem.

However, I am still getting an ambiguity warning between ( __asm |
_asm |
asm ) and ID. I don't want to accept this because it looks as though
something could be wrong (although it does in fact work).

I have tried the following options but they don't work (Cut down to
minimum
for demonstration).

AsmStatements
 :
 (options{generateAmbigWarnings = false;}:
  (&quot;__asm&quot;|&quot;_asm&quot;|&quot;asm&quot;) //etc.
 )
 ;

AsmStatements
 options{generateAmbigWarnings = false;}
 :
  (&quot;__asm&quot;|&quot;_asm&quot;|&quot;asm&quot;) // etc.
 ;

Antlr accepts these statements but I still get lexical nondeterminsim
between rules AsmStatements and ID.

I can't find any similar example in the ANTLR2 documentation and I
would be
grateful if someone could let me know what I doing wrong.

Thanks.

David Wigg

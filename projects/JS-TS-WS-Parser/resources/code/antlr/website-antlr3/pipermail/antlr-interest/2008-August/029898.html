You have to add this information for each token, so you are increasing
the memory usage for everyone in the vague hope that the information,
which can be calculated anyway, is useful in certain situations. If
there are things that cannot be easily calculated, I would be all for
adding them.

Because there is no way to know what the tabs mean. We went through all
of this in v2 - sometimes the user has to do it themselves to get it
accurate.

It's not a difficult piece of code to write, but any generic
implementation just won't be useful enough I think. I might put
something in the C runtime, but if one cannot code this in a few
minutes, then it is unlikely one would have got that far ;-)

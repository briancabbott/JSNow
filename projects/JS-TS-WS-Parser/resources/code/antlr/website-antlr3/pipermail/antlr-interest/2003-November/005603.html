ANTLRException.cpp does not exist. (it may have existed once though) are
you by any chance using an old workspace ?

The other errors (presuming you have the same as Richard) basically look like
MS weirdness. Try changing linkage/constness of these variables at their
definitions. I'm no VC7 user and don't have access to it so I have no clue.
It is kindoff strange since I had reports that it worked with VC7.1 :(

One note about the symbols those are all objects of which there should be
only *one* for every lexer/parser/treeparser combination (that works on the
same ast) 

Cheers,

Ric

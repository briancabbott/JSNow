<PRE>Yes, we are trying to migrate our ANTLR2 grammar to ANTLR2, we are also facing this problem. If the static initialize code will be separated from parser_class, That's will be great for us.

Back in the days when we tried to migrate our ANTLR2 grammar to ANTLR3,
we also experienced this problem, due to lots of static initializer code
in the _parser_ class. Our solution was to apply some perl-skript magic,
but if Alex Marin now proposes a built-in solution, that is only good
for ANTLR.

You should not need to worry about having lots of keywords, so one of the other rules must be causing the huge expansion. For instance I have problems with the complete lexer for TSQL, which has more keywords than you can shake a stick at.

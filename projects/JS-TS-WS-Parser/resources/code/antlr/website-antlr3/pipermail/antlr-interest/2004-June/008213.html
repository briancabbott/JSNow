<PRE>Hi Priyank,

&gt;&gt;<i>Here are my problems...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>1) PLAIN_TEXT consumes everything
</I>
In the ANTLR documentation (you can find it on www.antlr.org), there is a
section titled &quot;ANTLR masquerading as SED&quot;. You will read about the &quot;greedy&quot;
option and that will help you solve problem #1.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2) since this is unstructures text, how do I know where to stop (EOF)
</I>
You had mentioned that PLAIN_TEXT will consume whatever, until it finds a
&quot;&lt;&quot; (start tag). So, if your text didn't end with a tag, your INPUT_TEXT
should be able to eat your input. If your text ends with a &quot;&lt;/mytag&gt;&quot;, your
ENDTAG will successfully parse it and stop. Look at this page to understand
how EOF works, in ANTLR: <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/doc/metalang.html">http://www.antlr.org/doc/metalang.html</A> (Third
paragraph in the first page talks about EOF).

&gt;&gt;<i>3) I also need to support HTML tags in the PLAIN_TEXT (I have to consume
</I>them in PLAIN_TEXT)

Basically, this is a subset of your original problem. If PLAIN_TEXT is of
the form:

This is &lt;b&gt;plain&lt;/b&gt; text.

It is similar to your original template, except that it has HTML tags
embedded in it, instead of XML tags.

__________

I'm a newbie too, to ANTLR. I had similar problems and reading these
sections helped me solve them and understand how EOF worked. I hope my
pointers help you find your answers.

Hi,

Sorry if this is very trivial but I could not find a solution in any 
of the examples.

I am writing a parser for a template that contains unstructured text 
with embedded XML-type tags. So one example of such a template is

This is a test template created by &lt;mytag&gt;some text here&lt;/mytag&gt;. 
Thanks for your time.

In the lexer, I have defined rules like 
PLAIN_TEXT: consume whatever you see till &lt; tag
STARTTAG: copied from xml parser in examples
ENDTAG: copied from xml parser in examples

So the stream of tokes i am expecting is
PLAIN_TEXT STARTTAG PLAIN_TEXT ENDTAG

Here are my problems...
1) PLAIN_TEXT consumes everything
2) since this is unstructures text, how do I know where to stop (EOF)
3) I also need to support HTML tags in the PLAIN_TEXT (I have to 
consume them in PLAIN_TEXT)

I am stuck how to go about it.

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks
Priyank

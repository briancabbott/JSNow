You mean antlr itself gives a stack overflow or your generated parser does?
(think the latter, but just want to be sure)

Is it a genuine stack overflow or a stack corruption?

&gt;<i> The other odd thing about this is that the large procedures

</I>&gt;<i> No big expressions. The overflow is related strictly to the 
</I>&gt;<i> number of lines in a procedure, not the complexity of the 
</I>&gt;<i> expressions or anything else. The stack, as it is related to the

</I>&gt;<i> I know the grammar rules are closing properly because I have run

</I>
Where does the stack overflow happen? During the running of the parser?
During tree construction? Or ? During deletion of the parser object ? (if
that's something that happens in C# not very familiar with it) ? Try to
track down the thing triggering the overflow.

&gt;<i> Can anyone out there who is using antlr java or C++ comment on
</I>&gt;<i> stack overflow problems for large source.  Is there one
</I>&gt;<i> implementation platform that is better, do they all have this
</I>&gt;<i> problem? Is this a .Net memory management problem? Comments
</I>
Very hard to tell what is happening with the amount of information you
give.

Cheers,

Ric

  &quot;I think we better split up.&quot;
  &quot;Good idea. We can do more damage that way.&quot;

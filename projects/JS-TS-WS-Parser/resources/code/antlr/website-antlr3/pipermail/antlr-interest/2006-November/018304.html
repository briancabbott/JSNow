I have it installed and am using it to explore and validate my grammars 
(as well as using CLI to compile them), but I'm reluctant to do major 
editing in something other than my favorite editor.

I use jEdit for all my major editing (and Vim for some things for which 
its global editing suits me better). In contrast, I use Eclipse for 
quickly fixing Java coding errors and &lt;oXygen&gt; for editing XML schemas 
and, I expect, ANTLRworks for ANTLR-specific activities.

The thing is, purpose-built editors such as ANTLRworks and &lt;oXygen&gt; 
emphasize their domain and not general-purpose editing. As such, they 
usually disappoint me (in the editing department) while proving very 
productivity-enhancing w.r.t. to their domain. That's why I split my 
activities between editing in jEdit and various domain-specific 
activities in the special-purpose tools.

So I'd still like to have a syntax mode for ANTLR (v3--there is a v2.x 
one already), and if nothing turns up, I may try creating one myself, 
though it's rather arcane and I have little experience with it and am a 
total newbie to ANTLR...

I've got it set to check daily.

<PRE>Hi all,
I am back with the same question. 3 months ago I rolled back to
javacc, which I know marginally better, but now I really want to move
to antlr. Unfortunately, I can't figure out how to delay the
processing of a node... (if this is the correct solution)

If you don't want to read all this old thread, the question is:

- How to translate this antlr v2 in antlr v3?

^(IF condition x:.)        // x is NOT evaluated, merely captured
   { if ($condition.value) { stat(x); }

tia,
uL

Hi all,

for antlr3 the stat(x) will not work, because you can not pass the
sub-tree to a rule any more (which the rule then processes).
In antlr3 the current tree parsing position is stored in the
TreeNodeStream class instance, which is an instance variable of your
TreeParser class. So you can not easily tell a sub-rule what part of
the tree to process. You need instead to forward/rewind the
TreeNodeStream to the correct position, before calling the rule of
interest.

For writing interpreters with antlr3 I see only two solutions:
-Create a new instance of the TreeParser to handle the sub-tree
(incurs a lot of overhead)
-Sub-class (Common)TreeNodeStream to easily jump to certain positions
in the TreeNodeStream (similar to the mark() and rewind() methods in
CommonTreeNodeStream, but these are stack based and will thus not work
in your case).

Or does one of the other experts knows a better solution to this problem?

Regards,

J&#246;rg

I don't know antlr3 syntax, but the general idea is to process only
the elements you want, and skip ths others.  In other words, delay
processing the &quot;assign&quot; until you know that the condition is true.

^(IF condition x:.)        // x is NOT evaluated, merely captured
   { if ($condition.value) { stat(x); }

Hope this helps!

&gt;<i> I want to add to the expression evaluation a conditional expression:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I have correctly built the lexer and parser stuff, but I can't
</I>&gt;<i> figure out how to check the condition and then act. My tree stuff
</I>&gt;<i> parse the condition, no matter if the condition is true or false. I am
</I>&gt;<i> probably missing something here.

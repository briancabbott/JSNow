 &gt;I totally see your point. However, what would you intend to
 &gt;report as a column number in that case? Assume 8 char wide
 &gt;tabs? (I'm asking this out of interest, not spite.)

Yes, since that's the standard tab width (and the 
one expected by gcc).  But probably also have a 
command-line parameter in the generated tool to 
override this if needed.  (If a plugin is used to 
manage the build instead of just a build rule, 
then it could pass in the editor's current tab 
setting, if that works better.  Of course, a 
plugin would probably implement the parser inline 
rather than calling a helper tool, so that point might be moot.)

 &gt;Ok, I can't give you assurance of course, but I'd like to
 &gt;improve at least ANTLR's Tool messages (probably not
 &gt;changing the charPositionLine to mean column, but presenting
 &gt;it a bit differently so it's clear). The main goal would be
 &gt;to print the offending place with a bit of context in a nice
 &gt;manner.

Definitely, charPositionInLine should stay as is, 
yes :)  And some additional context would be 
wonderful -- for humans, anyway.  But the 
line/column printout is also useful for automated tools.

 &gt;Again, my vote is strongly for keeping charPositionInLine
 &gt;as _the_ definitive source of horizontal locations, because
 &gt;that's the most useful thing for anything else than printing
 &gt;(esp when communicating with other tools, since it's really
 &gt;the logical character offset not meddled with in any way).

Agreed.

 &gt;I'm strongly against adding any memory 
footprint to CommonToken,
 &gt;as that's the one most people use. It might 
sound silly to argue
 &gt;about adding a couple of bytes, but it really does make a
 &gt;difference for large input text. This is a 
question of trading a
 &gt;little time for potentially large amounts of memory and I think
 &gt;it's worth the effort.

I'm not sure I agree there.  I think it keeps 
things simpler if you work it out at lexing time 
-- simply watch for '\t's in the incoming char 
stream in a similar manner to how ANTLR 
automatically recognises '\r's and '\n's now.

But then again, I usually tend to work with small 
input sets (although I do have a couple of 
grammars that operate on input files of 20-30MB 
or so), so it doesn't seem like a big deal to me 
to add 2-4 bytes extra per token.

Getting the column number is fairly 
straightforward -- set it to 1 at the start of 
the line, then for each non-tab character simply 
increment it by 1.  If you hit a tab, then 
increment it by (tabSize - ((column-1) % 
tabSize)) instead; alternatively set it to 
((trunc((column-1) / tabSize) * tabSize) + 1), 
whichever's easiest/fastest.

If this is done during the initial lexing pass, 
it might reduce speed infinitestimally, but the 
column numbers can then be saved to each token 
for whatever purpose desired -- most probably for 
error messages, but it could be useful for 
diagnostics or logging or something as well.

If it's deferred until later, then you have to be 
able to locate the character position of the 
start of the line containing a token, given only 
whatever data is in the token itself, then scan 
forward and make the calculations as above -- 
which might mean you're going over the same 
ground multiple times, if you're doing this for 
multiple tokens on the same line.

So... well, I don't know.  If the start of line 
positions are available in the runtime, and if 
this sort of thing is only likely to ever be used 
for error reporting, then I guess calculating it 
after the fact makes a certain amount of 
sense.  But I just really want to have it handy anyway ;)

Trying to work it out after the fact gets 
complicated though when there are modified tokens 
(eg. imaginary tokens or tokens that have been 
'setText'ed)...  mind you, I guess the same issue 
exists with the line and charPositionInLine members now.

 &gt;The reason I wouldn't like it to be the default 
in BaseRecognizer
 &gt;(or whatever overrides displayError) is that we don't know the
 &gt;token type to look for. This is another thing that needs to be
 &gt;configured by the developer.

I'm not sure I follow that argument.  You have to 
deal with things at the character level, not the 
token level.  In fact you have to go all the way 
back to the original character stream, since 
there's no guarantee that tokens have been 
generated that contain all the characters, nor 
what order they're in.  (And of course the lexer 
has to be able to obtain column numbers for its 
current position in order to report errors, 
without even having a token.)

 &gt;OTOH I suppose we could be mean and expand \t in _every_ token
 &gt;we encounter, by getting its text.

No, that wouldn't work, since its text may have 
been modified.  The only way to get the real 
column number is to look at the original input directly.

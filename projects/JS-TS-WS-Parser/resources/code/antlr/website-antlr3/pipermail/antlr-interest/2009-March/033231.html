<PRE>I've retired from maintaining this C/C++ parser but I've been following
recent discussions with some puzzlement as at the moment I can't see what
the aim is. I regret I have lost track of who raised this question, perhaps
he/she could let us know what text is to be parsed, the aim and the reason
for it

Before replying I draw your attention to the information below about the
language definition which is in my download. You will see that it makes it
clear that the grammar alone is not sufficient. The words in para 1 under
the two lines are from Bjarne's book.

Thanks,

David.

 C++ Language Definition

Notes:
DW 23/04/03
This data was originally obtained from,
<A HREF="http://www.csci.csusb.edu/dick/C++std/cd2/gram.html">http://www.csci.csusb.edu/dick/C++std/cd2/gram.html</A>
I have converted the original hyphens separating words in names to
underscores and the opt(ional) indicator at the end of names to -opt to aid
searching.
As this file is stored in text mode the textual distinction between reserved
keywords
and other words has been lost. The keywords should be listed in any book
about C++.
DW 27/09/04
This data has been modified to match the grammar listed in Appendix A of
&quot;The C++ Programming Language&quot; Third Edition by Bjarne Stroustrup
ISBN 0201889544
Deleted or amended lines of the original (old) text are shown within []
brackets. Lines copied from the book are shown as &quot;Book line&quot;.
One line was added from &quot;C++ In a Nutshell&quot; First edition, ISBN 059600298X
I would be grateful if anyone could let me know if it needs updating

  Grammar summary                                                 [gram]
  ______________________________________________________________________
1 This summary of C++ syntax is intended to be an aid to  comprehension.
  It  is  not  an  exact  statement of the language.  In particular, the
  grammar described here accepts a superset  of  valid  C++  constructs.
  Disambiguation rules (_stmt.ambig_, _dcl.spec_, _class.member.lookup_)
  must be applied to distinguish expressions  from  declarations.   Fur-
  ther,  access  control, ambiguity, and type rules must be used to weed
  out syntactically valid but meaningless constructs.
  1.1  Keywords                                               [gram.key]
1 New context_dependent keywords are introduced into a program by  type_
  def  (_dcl.typedef_),  namespace  (_namespace.def_),  class (_class_),
  enumeration (_dcl.enum_), and template (_temp_) declarations.
          typedef_name:
                  identifier
          namespace_name:
                  original_namespace_name
                  namespace_alias
          original_namespace_name:
                  identifier
          namespace_alias:
                  identifier
          class_name:
                  identifier
                  template_id
          enum_name:
                  identifier
          template_name:
                  identifier
  Note that a typedef_name naming a class is also a class_name
  (_class.name_).

parsable...&quot;.

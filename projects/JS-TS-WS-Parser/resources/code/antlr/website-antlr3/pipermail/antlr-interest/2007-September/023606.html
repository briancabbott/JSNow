<PRE>Hello,
   
  I have a problem which I have not been able to solve yet. Could you please have a look at it and give me your suggestions if any. Thank you very much in advance.
   
  I have built a parser grammar, AST and tree walker which work fine. The parser parses a language called SDL-CIF which basically contains a series of symbols and their coordinates in SDL diagrams. For example:
   
  /* CIF NextState (300,400) */
  nextstate Generate ;
   
  The above says: draw the symbol nextstate and label it &#147;Generate&#148; with the coordinates of 300 and 400.
  Now I have embedded the codes to draw the symbols within tree walker as following:
   
  {System.out.println(&#147;some codes&#148;);}
   
  The output of the test rig when run will be some codes which will be executed and draw the graph. I have written the drawing codes as templates like the following:
  (the language in blue is written in a drawing software environment)
   
  nextstate:^(SLIST nextstatebody)
  {System.out.println(&quot;nod4[shape=X, label='Y', pos='Z!', width=V, height=W, peripheries=0];&quot;);}
              ;
   
  The X, Y, Z, V, W in the above need to get the information from AST to look something like the following:
   
  nod4[shape=sdl_state,label='Generate',pos='2.5,5!',width=0.8,height=0.6,peripheries=0];
  How can I tell the tree walker to do that? (I need to produce this kind of codes for many different shapes and their connections which are straight lines)
   
  
  An exmple: I know I can use something like &#147;pos=&#146;&#148;$i &#147;,&#148;$j  to get the position for &quot;pos&quot; considering the rule  b26a in my grammar:
  b26      :b26a    ;
  b26a    :i=INT ',' j=INT;
              
  But is it correct? The INTs in b26a contain different integers at different times as the input contains different integer values. How can $i get the right information for a shape considering that many rules use the rule 26a and the INTs in b26a match different integers including page numbers, different shapes positions other than nextstate?
   
  Best regards,
   
  Al

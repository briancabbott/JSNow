Lex backtracks just like that.  Can you people not see that as  
backtracking?  I'm dumbfounded at this point.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This is because the clause ('.' DIGIT+)? must either match a dot  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> followed by at least one digit (minimum two characters) or match  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> nothing at all.  Seeing the dot and then assuming the following  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> character is a DIGIT without actually checking it first just  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> isn't right.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Isn't right in that it won't do what is natural.  I couldnt' make  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> antlr do the right thing easily in this case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Freudian slip? ;)
</I>
No, i meant every word.

&gt;<i> The original question was regarding Number = DIGIT+ ('.' DIGIT+)?  
</I>&gt;<i> and how LL(*) was deciding that '.' implied the entire chain, when  
</I>&gt;<i> it didn't. Perhaps another year would help, but I don't see how  
</I>&gt;<i> this counts as working.
</I>
It works per my algorithm.  Don't like it? Use another tool.  I know  
i'm a prof, but i'm getting tired of schooling you boys.  ANY char  
can follow.  No analysis possible.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Besides, isn't that what backtrack=... is for? :-) Maybe there's a  
</I>&gt;<i> lexer::backtrack switch needed? Or maybe k needs to be * instead of 1.
</I>
See my prev email. mimicking lex is easy.  Or, i can finally add my  
option to emit lexer errors i normally hush.

&gt;&gt;<i> Have you built a lex like creature before?  I have back in 1988.   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I believe I'm remembering how it operates correctly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think it matters, does it? You're in the recursive-descent  
</I>&gt;<i> business, not the state-machine business. You sell chicken, they  
</I>&gt;<i> sell hamburgers.
</I>
Yes, everyone i ssaying lex does it right though. sure. backtracking.  
so backtrack with antlr to do what you want.

Ok, i'm done now.

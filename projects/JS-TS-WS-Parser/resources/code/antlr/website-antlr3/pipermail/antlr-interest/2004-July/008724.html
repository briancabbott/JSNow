<PRE>Hi Eric, 

&gt;<i> I'm parsing a language that has something similar to the C 
</I>&gt;<i> preprocessor constructs.  Is there something in antlr already 
</I>&gt;<i> out there for this that somebody can point me to?
</I>
I'm currently exactly at that point: building a full preprocessor in Java. Actually, the preprocessor is ready, but I'm
testing it up and down with all files I can get. Today I changed the #if/#ifdef#/#elif handling from simple recursive
execution to a state machine. It should be ready for general use within the next two days.

&gt;<i> - the substitution can occur within two different lexer 
</I>&gt;<i> states where the tokens are different, so I think I need to 
</I>&gt;<i> store the substitutition text as a string as opposed to a 
</I>&gt;<i> list of tokens
</I>
What I do is to handle preprocessor directives before the text even reaches the lexer. For this I created a new input
state class, which is abled to track include files and a preprocessor class, which knows about this special input state
class. The input state class uses the preprocessor class as input reader, which in turn uses an input converter class
that does line splicing and trigraph sequence handling.

&gt;<i> - during the macro substitution, handling parameter 
</I>&gt;<i> substituion.  One of my lexer states that doesn't even have 
</I>&gt;<i> an identifier defined could make this problematic.
</I>
I also created a MacroTable class that does handle all the macro stuff. It is able to handle everything that can occur
in this regard (macro functions, symbolic constants, aware of recursive macro definitions etc.). The whole thing was
created according to MSDN:  Visual Studio -&gt; Visual C++ -&gt; Visual C++ Reference -&gt; C/C++ Languages -&gt;  C/C++
Preprocessor Reference -&gt; The Preprocessor -&gt; Macros. Since macro expansion is done before any text reaches the lexer
there is no problem with any combination of macro definitions and substitutions. See attachment (the class works fine
standalone, you have to change the package name, though).

&gt;<i> - expressions as arguments to the macro call.  The expression 
</I>&gt;<i> is defined in the parser and not the lexer, so its definition 
</I>&gt;<i> is not there.  Right now, I'm just matching up grouping 
</I>&gt;<i> symbols that can contain the &quot;,&quot; which is also the separator 
</I>&gt;<i> between the expressions.
</I>
I'd recommend not to let the normal parser/lexer combination handle the preprocessing stuff. Place an additional stage
before the real parser.
 
&gt;<i> Secondarily, an example for handling #if/#else would be nice. 
</I>&gt;<i>  I assume this would just gobble up tokens when it would find 
</I>&gt;<i> the condition to be false (nextToken).
</I>
Here is a part of my preprocessor that handles directives:

  /**
   * Checks for any known preprocessor directive and triggers individual processing.
   * 
   * @param input The directive with the number sign.
   * @return &lt;b&gt;true&lt;/b&gt; if the calling method should stop its reader loop.
   */
  private boolean processDirective(int directive, String input) throws FileNotFoundException, 
    IOException
  {
    boolean result = false;
    // Remove the leading number sign and split the rest into two parts of which the first
    // one is the directive and the second one the expression to parse.
    String[] parts = splitDirective(input);
    String directiveText = parts[1].trim();
    switch (directive)
    {
      case INCLUDE:
      {
        if (!skip)
          result = processInclude(macroTable.expandMacros(directiveText));
        break;
      }
      case DEFINE:
        if (!skip)
          processDefine(parts[1]);
        break;
      case UNDEF:
        if (!skip)
          processUndef(parts[1]);
        break;
      case IFDEF:
      {
        pendingStates.push(IF_DIRECTIVE);
        skipFlags.push(new Boolean(skip));
        if (!skip)
        {
          boolean condition = macroTable.isDefined(directiveText);
          if (!condition)
            skip = true;
        }
        break;
      }
      case IFNDEF:
      {

        }
        break;
      }
      case IF:
      {
        pendingStates.push(IF_DIRECTIVE);
        skipFlags.push(new Boolean(skip));
        if (!skip)

          if (!condition)
            skip = true;
        }
        break;
      }

        // See what the state was, which opened this conditional branch.

          {
            pendingStates.push(ELSE_DIRECTIVE);
            // If the superordinated conditional branch was already skipping then continue that,
            // otherwise reveverse the skip mode for this branch.
            Boolean lastSkipMode = (Boolean) skipFlags.peek();
            if (!lastSkipMode.booleanValue())
              skip = !skip;
            break;
          }
          default:
          {
            reportError(&quot;Unexpected #else preprocessor directive found.&quot;);
          }
        }
        break;
      }
      case ELIF:
      {
        Integer pendingState = (Integer) pendingStates.pop();
        // See what the state was, which opened this conditional branch.
        switch (pendingState.intValue())
        {
          case IFDEF:
          case IFNDEF:
          case IF:
          case ELIF:
          {
            pendingStates.push(IF_DIRECTIVE);
            // If the superordinated conditional branch was already skipping then continue that,
            // otherwise reveverse the skip mode for this branch.
            Boolean lastSkipMode = (Boolean) skipFlags.peek();
            if (!lastSkipMode.booleanValue())
            {
              // If currently lines are skipped then the previous conditional branch failed the
              // condition. So check again if there is this time a hit.
              if (skip)
              {
                boolean condition = evaluateBooleanExpression(macroTable.expandMacros(parts[1]));
                if (condition)
                  skip = false;
              }
            }
            break;
          }
          default:
          {
            reportError(&quot;Unexpected #elif preprocessor directive found.&quot;);
          }
        }
        break;
      }
      case ENDIF:
      {
        Integer pendingState = (Integer) pendingStates.pop();
        Boolean lastSkipMode = (Boolean) skipFlags.pop();
        skip = lastSkipMode.booleanValue();
        // See what the state was, which opened this conditional branch.
        switch (pendingState.intValue())
        {
          case IF:
          case IFDEF:
          case IFNDEF:
          case ELIF:
          case ELSE:
          {
            // Return to parent mode.
            break;
          }
          default:
          {
            reportError(&quot;Unexpected #endif preprocessor directive found.&quot;);
          }
        }
        break;
      }
    }
    
    return result;
  }

This code is currently under heavy testing and could change if an error is found.

&gt;<i> Or, should the preprocessor be a separate filter instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> included with the lexer - token stream filter?
</I>
Yes, definitely. I tried several times but could not get ANTRL to generate a preprocessor for me so I wrote one by hand.
After many changes I ended up with a relatively simple preprocessor class, which is accompanied by the macro table, an
expression parser (generated with ANTLR) and an evaluator class.

&gt;<i> Again a preprocessor example with text subtitution (including
</I>&gt;<i> parameters) and conditional constructs would help out a lot.  
</I>&gt;<i> There's got to one out there.  I did some googling without success.
</I>
No, there is none (at least no free one). That's the reason why I started mine. But hold, soon there is a free one: I
plan to publish mine as open source :-)

<PRE>Hi,

 

I have a small project and I was wondering if ANTLR would be good to do it.
Here it goes.

 

I have a bunch of DTDs and I have to constantly write XSLs to convert XML
based on one DTD to another. Thease DTDs keep getting updated in very short
intervals, so I always have to update my XSL maps accordingly, now I want to
automate this. So the problem in simple words would be to create an XSL map
file based on the two DTDs. Now I know I can do this using XSL itself but
the job would be pretty much complicated owing to the fact that I have to do
&quot;many to many&quot; mapping here. Also the design has to be generic so that any
set of DTD could be used. Many good compilers and transformers have been
written in ANTLR but would it be good for this, if not is there any other
approach I could employ. Please enlighten me on this..

 

Thanks

Raj Singh Sisodia

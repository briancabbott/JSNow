I think that what is needed is a &quot;rule import&quot; mechanism, instead of 
subclassing. If you did this, then I could import rules from more than 
one grammar and do so selectively. Also, my parser could import all the 
rules from my lexer, and then when I run my parser grammer through ANTLR 
it can actually tell me which lexer rules I forgot at code-generation 
time, instead of me having to figure it out at runtime.

</I>
But, how do you specify the joinpoints? Wouldn't you use the grammar 
rules as the join-points? If so, then you really haven't gained anything.

Have you looked at SableCC? They don't allow you to put any rules into 
your grammar. Instead, they automatically generate a bunch of classes 
that represent a heterogeneous AST. Then you subclass these generated 
classes to include your code.

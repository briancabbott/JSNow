We had a C runtime working thanks to Ric months ago, but he can't  
keep up with my constant changes to the templates as I race to the  
finish line.  Poor guy has to work for a living! ;)  I hope that he  
will catch up when I finish the tree stuff :)

The C.stg file provided doesn't actually work anymore, but it does  
give you the idea.  The various targets will literally be a simple  
change of template file...no code!  The dream was verified by Ric  
back at the ANTLR2004 workshop when he cranked out C.stg :)   
CSharp.stg should be pretty easy.

The only target code needed is of course the support library, which  
this time is clearly identified. ;)

Honey badger will take whatever you give it, as long as it is not indirectly left recursive. It doesn't give a shit. :)

The R grammar requires the special TestR.java test rig because I put a filter between the lexer in the parser so that it handles the context-sensitive newlines properly. In other words, it ignores newlines within an expression but still uses \n to terminate expressions. took me quite a long time to figure out the optimal solution.

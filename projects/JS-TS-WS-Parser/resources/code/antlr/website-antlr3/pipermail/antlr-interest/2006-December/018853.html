<PRE>Hi Bill!

You can go either way, but unless you have really specific  
requirements, a homogeneous tree (all nodes are of the same class)  
should do it.
You'd differentiate the subtrees by their root node (most of them  
will be imaginary tokens).

See question 3 ;)

</I>
A treewalker approach is the easiest to modify, IMHO, and can save  
you a lot of custom code. Furthermore you have the additional benefit  
of having a LL-parser for trees, too.
The semantic checks would be done in actions in that (or those) tree  
parsers.

&gt;<i> I'm new to ANTLR, have just read (most of) the spec, and I could

Have a look at the Mantra language Terence is working on &lt;http:// 
linguamantra.org&gt;. It is using ANTLR v3, although the principle is  
applicable
to v2, also. Not sure which version you will be using.

HTH,

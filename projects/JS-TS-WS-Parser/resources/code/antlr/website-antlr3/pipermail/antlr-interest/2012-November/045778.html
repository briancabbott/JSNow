I think it's very sensitive to how you write the grammar. I was very happy with the fuzzy Java parser as it wasn't loose at all. this is with v4
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) ANTLRWorks debugger took significant time to parse the real data.

ah. you must be using v3. All bets are off.  v3 option fuzzy is very slow O(n^2)

</I>Word processors have dealt with this problem for years. They &quot;must&quot; 
layout the visible page at typing speed. The general way to do this is 
to break up the document into smaller objects; determine the first 
object that could have changed; do a foreground layout for anything that 
can change on the screen and a background layout for the rest. As an 
optimization, the layout can terminate anytime an object that is still 
valid has not been affected by the current change (for instance if a 
modified paragraph doesn't change its number of lines, further layout is 
unnecessary).
Parsing code is very similar. It can't do the foreground/background 
split but the other optimizations are very appropriate.

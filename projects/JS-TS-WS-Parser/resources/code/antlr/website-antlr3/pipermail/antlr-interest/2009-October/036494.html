<PRE>Hi everyone,

 

I finally implemented true MSBuild integration for ANTLR grammars in C#
projects. In addition to the tool (AntlrTool.exe), you'll need the
targets file (Antlr3.targets) and build task library
(AntlrBuildTask.dll). The latest builds can be found in the
bin\Bootstrap directory with the C# port of the tool. The integration
should work with any of the C# targets as long as the project is being
built in Visual Studio 2008 or later. Here is a list of basic features:

 

*         Proper handling of inter-grammar dependencies.

*         Uses timestamps for incremental builds. When regenerating code
from the grammars is required, it uses the fast C# port. 19 grammars are
generated for the C# port of the ANTLR tool itself, and a full rebuild
including the grammars takes 8 seconds.

*         Generated outputs strictly constrained to the intermediate
build path (normally obj\Debug and obj\Release).

*         Build, Clean, Rebuild all work as expected.

*         Much easier to add new grammars to a project. For an immediate
example, open Antlr3.csproj (the C# port) as an XML file. Later I'll be
writing up a new set of directions for including grammars in your
projects.

 

I'll be re-packaging everything as a regular download in the near
future.

 

Thank you,

Sam Harwell

<PRE>I am sure that the error message will improve but at the moment that comes straight from stringtemplate and isn&#8217;t caught I think.

The ;-) was intended to imply that my comment was a joke though - there should be no problem using global scopes. I should point out that in fact the global refers to the grammar, the global scopes (before whatever change broke them) are not global in the C sense as I wanted the generated C to be completely free-threading.

I might get some time this weekend to clean that one up. :-)

 &gt;Are you sure you need a global scope? ;-)

No, I don't *need* one -- I've already rewritten the grammar to 
use dynamic scopes instead, since they seemed to work fine (and my 
grammar does now work fine).  I just thought it'd be a good idea 
to mention to someone. :)

Especially since an exception dump doesn't seem like a good 
response.  Couldn't it recognise that it's an issue with the 
codegen template and simply report that rather than spewing a full 
exception?  Just a thought.

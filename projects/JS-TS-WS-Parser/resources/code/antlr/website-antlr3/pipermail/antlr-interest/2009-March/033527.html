Well, if you were in the parser you could access 
previously-consumed tokens with LA(-1), LA(-2), etc.  You can do 
the same thing in the lexer but it'll give you the characters 
instead of the tokens.

It'd be hard to write that sort of code anyway -- you can't just 
look at &quot;the single previously generated token&quot; because there's a 
very high chance that it's a comment or whitespace or something, 
meaning you'd have to look further back, and it just quickly gets 
unwieldy.

Probably a better idea is to follow the example in the wiki about 
generating multiple tokens from a single lexer rule.  That way you 
can keep everything under your own control and only emit the set 
once you're sure that's what you really want :)

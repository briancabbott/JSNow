Yep, coming to the conclusion that it's only symbol table stuff that  
needs to go in and that naturally unrolls itself...IF actions are  
executed.  Currently there is no way to specify that an action must  
execute even when backtracking.  That we still need a suggestion  
for.  I almost wonder if it's a global flag like &quot;always exec  
actions&quot; and then if you need a few not-executed, you can manually  
gate with &quot;if ( !guessing )&quot;.

Hmm....

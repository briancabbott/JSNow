</I>The hard part is associating each comment with a particular node in the 
AST. Peter Van Der Ahe at Sun wrote a
good paper about how hard that is, and even that paper only scratched 
the surface.

Consider this code:
----------------------------------------
// here is a comment that appears to be at the top of the file, but only 
because there are a few blank lines after it.

// a comment that seems to &quot;go with&quot; the following line, and not the 
previous comment, but again, only because of blank lines
int i;

for (int i=0; i&lt;10 /* what does any inline comment go with? */; i++)
   // a comment that &quot;goes with&quot; the block inside the for loop
  {
      // another comment that &quot;goes with&quot; the block inside the for loop
  }  // does this comment &quot;go with&quot; the for loop, or the following code?
----------------------------------------

If you have control of the language (sounds like you do), I'd seriously 
consider making comments a real part of the grammar,
perhaps having a &quot;comment statement&quot;, as opposed to the C, C++, Java, 
and many other languages approach of
allowing statements anywhere and having a preprocessor throw them out.

<PRE>Sorry that I ask - but I did not find it on the Wiki and not in the ANTLR
book: What do . and Tokens mean in tree grammars?

AFAIK, . means &quot;any complete subtree.&quot; - although this seems not to work in
some current builds, if I understood some email of yesterday correctly?

Question number two:
Does a single Token also match a complete tree with this token at the root,
or only a &quot;childless tree&quot; (i.e. the token as a tree node alone)?

Question number three:
What sort of lookahead is used over . ? For example, would the following
work - assume here that the subtrees can be arbitrarily large subconditions
(as is usual in expression trees):

condition : ^(AND . ^(NOT .))	-&gt; ...rewrite1...
	| ^(AND . .)		-&gt; ...rewrite2...
	;

The intention of this is to rewrite an AND tree which has as second child a
tree with a NOT root to rewrite1; whereas all other trees are supposed to be
rewritten as rewrite2.
If ANTLR tree parsing works the way I assume it - namely the whole tree is
flattened to a node sequence, on which &quot;one-dimensional&quot; parsing techniques
(even LL(*)) are applied, then the NOT will be &quot;too far&quot; away even for an
LL(*) analysis, because there will be recursively nested expressions on the
way between the AND and the NOT. However, if ANTLR goes for real
&quot;two-dimensional&quot; parsing, or does some lookahead over arbitrarily large
subtrees (to the readily available &quot;later&quot; children!) - which I would call
&quot;1.5-dimensional lookahead computation/parsing&quot;, then the above two patterns
could be disambiguated.

Thanks
Harald

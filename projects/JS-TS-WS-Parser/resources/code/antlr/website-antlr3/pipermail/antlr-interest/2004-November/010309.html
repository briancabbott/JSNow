John,
Interesting read.
I don't know if my reply has anything to do with what you said,
but here goes anyway :)

When deciding on an approach (meaning a programming language,
tools, etc) to a programming problem, I first try to describe some
examples in normal english. So, with a C-to-Java translator,
I start saying &quot;I'm going to have lots of specifications like the
following&quot;:

&quot;Replace any C main() functions with equivalent Java main() functions&quot;.

I then try to describe an algorithm, also in English:

&quot;Find any main() function that return 'int' (or no return type
is specified) and take two arguments - an 'int' and an
array of char pointers. Replace it with this signature:
'public static void main(String[] args)', and replace all references
to 'argc' with args.length and arg[] with args[]. Also,
deal with the off-by-one problem with args[].&quot;

Then I look for the language or tool that lets me specify
my algorithm in a way that most closely matches my English
description.

For lexers and parsers, a BNF-like spec best matches
the English description of the problem (lexer: &quot;A Token
is one of the following sequences of characters&quot;, for a parser,
&quot;A package definition is the token 'package' followed by
an ID token, followed by zero or more &quot;.&quot;-and-ID-token, followed
by a ';'&quot;).

Now sometimes a whole different way of approaching the problem
can work out in the end. For example, you might end up replacing
a lot of C++/Java code with a
a state machine or a set of &quot;business rules&quot; or whatever.
But requiring the application developer to change his mindset
in such a major way is a major burden. It must be extremely
clear at the end that there's a large benefit, as the
developer will constantly be struggling to re-phrase the
'natural' algorithm that first pops into his head, into the
new mechanism.

With lexers and parsers, the natural way to think about the
problem is clearly specified with a BNF-like grammar. But
with a complex AST-to-AST transformation, the natural thought
process is to have a sequence of 'rules' like:
&quot;here are the steps to change the main() function&quot;.
This is much more intuitive then a set of actions embedded
in the BNF-like grammar, as the thought process there is
&quot;Here are the things that I should do to translate 
a C FUNCTION_DEF to a Java one.&quot;

I have a rule to change a main() function, another to change
a printf() function, and dozens (or hundreds) of others.
These rules don't have a lot in common with each other, and 
I'd hate to have an action for each one at the FUNCTION_DEF
node in a grammar. I'd also hate to have a single
handleAllFunctionDefinitions() method that's called at each
function declaration. That's just not a natural way to think
about the problem.

As an aside, I guess I'm just a non-conformist.
I know full well that the &quot;right&quot; way to do a translator
is to parse into an AST and then do AST-to-AST conversion.
And I tried that for a few months and then abandoned it.
I'm just not smart enough to take a snippet of code,
parse it into an AST in my head, figure out what the &quot;output&quot;
AST should look like in my head, and write the code to
change it. Instead, I just want to write:
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { --&gt; public static void main(String
args) {

And so that's what I did. I started over, removed all the AST stuff,
and spent the next two years working
with token streams directly, building rules like that one.
It's horribly inefficient and error prone, but I do spend
95% of my time thinking about what the rules should be.
With the AST stuff, I spent probably 80% of my time figuring out
how to implement the rules and only 20% on what the rules should
be.

And please don't dismiss me as &quot;some lunatic that doesn't
even believe in symbol tables&quot;, I'm just not believing in them
for certain applications. And the performance requirements for
a one-time source-to-source translator are completely different
from those for a compiler or interpreter.

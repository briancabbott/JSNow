<PRE>If the exit trigger in your nested language is not something that can be
picked up lexically, then I don&#8217;t see how you can use the nested grammar
in quite the same way. Though it seems a little strange that there is no
lexical context for the end of the embedded language, I have in fact had
to deal with something similar to this myself.

 

However, I assume that your parser knows when to stop parsing, so:

 

1)      There will be a finite set of terminals that end the parse;

2)      Have the second lexer just lex from the trigger point to the end
of the input stream (it should not throw out any errors, use ANY : . ;
to consume anything it can&#8217;t really handle.

a.       If there is a way to safely determine a point where it
definitely ends, then limit the input length to that;

3)      Parse the second token stream but don&#8217;t use EOF on your start
rule.

4)      Record the input position in the input stream for any terminal
that might end the parse;

5)      When the parse ends, reset the input stream to the offset
directly following the end of the terminating terminal;

 

But, that seems like you will end up lexing a lot of things you should
not need to this way, especially if you have a lot of embedded elements.
Perhaps if you mention what you are trying to parse, then better
solutions can be thought of.  

 

One other thought is whether the first lexer can determine where the
embedded language starts and stops in which case you can tokenize the
whole text into one token and invoke the embedded language parser from
your parser.

Now I could try this. The problem is that I would have to emit the
EOF_TOKEN from the parser, because the lexer has no idea whether the
nested language input has come to its end or not. But the token buffer
surely contains tokens that are not in the nested language, so I have to
get out from the nested lexer and roll back the consumed tokens somehow.

Do you have an idea for the solution?

Thank you,

Bert

Thomas Brandon &#237;rta: 

Check out the island-grammar example. It shows lexer based nesting. The
pertinent code in the main lexer is:
JAVADOC : '/**'
          {
            // create a new javadoc lexer/parser duo that feeds
            // off the current input stream 
            System.out.println(&quot;enter javadoc&quot;);
            JavadocLexer j = new JavadocLexer(input);
            CommonTokenStream tokens = new CommonTokenStream(j);
            tokens.discardTokenType (JavadocLexer.WS);
            JavadocParser p = new JavadocParser(tokens);
            p.comment();
            // returns a JAVADOC token to the java parser but on a
            // different channel than the normal token stream so it 
            // doesn't get in the way.
            $channel = JAVADOC_CHANNEL;
          }
        ;
And in the nested lexer:
/** When the javadoc parser sees end-of-comment it just says 'I'm done',
which 
 *  consumes the tokens and forces this javadoc parser (feeding
 *  off the input stream currently) to exit.  It returns from
 *  method comment(), which was called from JAVADOC action in the
 *  Simple parser's lexer. 
 */
END     : '*/' {token = Token.EOF_TOKEN;}
          {System.out.println(&quot;exit javadoc&quot;);}
        ;

Your code in the outer lexer looks OK, just passing the same input
stream should keep it synched. Check your code for exiting the inner
lexer. 

Tom.

Thank you for your answer.
If I understand your suggestion correctly, the problem with it is that I
can't lex the symbol: actually it is an embedded language, so only the
nested lexer and parser can find the end of the embedded part. So
actually I would need the following: feed the nested lexer/parser with
all the input beginning from the '/**' symbol and let it parse it. Then
when the parsing is over, I'd like to set the non-nested lexer/parser to
the end position of the nested parsing. So the problem is how to set the
input stream position to the end of the embedded part, either rewinding
or forward winding. Maybe I can use the return value of the nested
rootRule() to find the position. However I could not find a way yet how
to do this all.

Anyway, if you have some example of some nested parsing, that could
probably effectively help me.

Thanks,

Bert

I wouldn't do it like this.
If you want to really do this in the (non-nested) lexer: &quot;Lex&quot; the
symbol;
and then start a NEW StringReader on the symbols's getText(), from which
you
feed your (nested) lexer and parser.
Maybe you want to do this in the (non-nested) parser ... easy if the
symbol
turns up there; a little work if you pushed the symbol into the HIDDEN
channel (or some other channel) in the (non-nested) lexer, so that you
have
to &quot;undig&quot; it somehow in the (non-nested) parser
Hope this very short explanation helps.

   Subject: [antlr-interest] ANTLR3 Nested parser
    
   Hi,
    
   I'm creating a parser with nested parser. To make it simple I 
   tell you my problem as if I was doing Javadoc parsing inside 
   a Java parser.
   So I have this in my lexer:
   JAVADOC: '/**' { JavadocParser javadocParser = new 
   JavadocParser(new CommonTokenStream(new 
   JavadocLexer(this.input))); javadocParser.rootRule(); }
    
   The problem is that while this code correctly switches to the 
   Javadoc lexer, and parses the Javadoc parts correctly, upon 
   returning from the Javadoc parsing, the character stream is 
   not correctly positioned.
    
   Can you help me how to achieve the nested parsing in antlr 3?
    
   Thank you very much,
    
   Bertalan Fodor
    
   ps I've already asked this on this list, but got no answer, 
   so I tried to make my question more simple.

Parsers are mostly worthless by themselves in my experience.  When was 
the last time anybody needed a C compiler that said &quot;yes, it's valid C 
code&quot; instead of &quot;here's your machine code&quot;? &lt;wink&gt;.  So, you must have 
actions within the grammar even to build (nontrivial) trees.  Actions 
imply a language and hence the grammar should be the one not the 
command-line to specify the language.  If you only wanted a parser and 
you could build trees automatically in a language independent way (see 
Loring's new stuff) *then* a command line option is useful :)

Good question!  A feature for a future ANTLR.

Again another poke for this issue which is still a bug in the C target.

kierans/antlr3 on Github has an attempt of the port of the Java fix 
which Jim did say he'd have a look at.

Any word on this?

Cheers,

Subject: [antlr-interest] Handling Antlr Syntax Errors or how to give a
 better message on unexpected token
Message-ID: <D2A5C7470D67A54FACE86B838946D49D14E466F386@NJ4MSGSCR02.markit.partners>

Hello,

We have the following sub-part of an Antlr grammar:

    signed_int
            : SIGN? INT
                    ;

    INT : '0'..'9'+
            ;

When someone enters a numeric value everything is fine, but if they
mistakenly type something like 1O (one and capital o) we get a cryptic
error message like:

    error 1 : Missing token              at offset 14
    near [Index: 0 (Start: 0-Stop: 0) ='<missing COLON>'    type<24> Line: 26 LinePos:14]
     : syntax error...

Obviously our grammar is more complex than the one given above, but this type of
error happens when the user mistypes an integer as above.

What is a good way to handle this type of error?  I thought of
defining a catch-all SYMBOL token type but this lead to too many parser
building errors.  I will continue looking into Antlr error handling but I
thought I would post this here to look for some insights.

Hi David, thanks very much for your response! I believe it's still okay to drop gUnit for v4?

one of your biggest tests is the AST construction, which of course is no longer necessary since ANTLR generates parse trees and automatically.

Your point about worrying about upgrades to the tool causing regressions is well taken, though, the parse tree is a well-defined structure derived from the grammar rules. I suppose in the future the types of the nodes could change, but the "toString" of the payloads would not, unless of course you yourself changed what the payload was. We should be okay here too.

Your grammar uses embedded actions, which we are also strongly discouraging in v4. That means it's also discouraged to return values from rules. So, there's no return values to test from a gUnit tool.

Going through your improvements with respect to v4:

> Expectations have:
> 
> OK/FAIL, same as before

I think this is easy enough to simulate where the sequence of method calls:

String[] inputs = { "input1", "input2", "input3", ? };
checkNoErrors(inputs); // checks number of syntax errors from parser

I do this a lot myself in v4. It's very useful when checking that *my* understanding of the grammar and how it assigns precedence to my input streams, but again I don't really need gunit:

		String[] tests = {
			"a",			"(s (e a) <EOF>)",
			"a+b",			"(s (e (e a) + (e b)) <EOF>)",
			"a*b",			"(s (e (e a) * (e b)) <EOF>)",
			"a?b:c",		"(s (e (e a) ? (e b) : (e c)) <EOF>)",
			"a=b=c",		"(s (e (e a) = (e (e b) = (e c))) <EOF>)",
			"a?b+c:d",		"(s (e (e a) ? (e (e b) + (e c)) : (e d)) <EOF>)",
			"a?b=c:d",		"(s (e (e a) ? (e (e b) = (e c)) : (e d)) <EOF>)",
			"a? b?c:d : e",	"(s (e (e a) ? (e (e b) ? (e c) : (e d)) : (e e)) <EOF>)",
			"a?b: c?d:e",	"(s (e (e a) ? (e b) : (e (e c) ? (e d) : (e e))) <EOF>)",
		};
		runTests(grammar, tests, "s");

It's not is pretty, but we get to avoid creating and maintaining a tool. 

> RETURN[<name>] allows you to test a rule return by name

As we are discouraging return values, this has less utility. Of course, if you do in fact have returned items, this would be useful. Whether the return on the investment of creating and maintaining a separate tools worth it, I'm not sure.

> OUTPUT (or ->) allows you to test the parse tree created with no parse
> errors expected

ANTLR should be generating the correct parse tree should be invariant for the same grammar, regardless of upgrades to the tool.

> ERROR allows you to test the parse tree with error nodes expected

I think raw code would also work here. I do something that looks almost like gUnit:

	String[] bad_inlineChecks = {
		"$lab",			"error(67): A.g4:7:4: missing attribute access on rule reference lab in $lab\n",
		"$q",           "error(63): A.g4:7:4: unknown attribute reference q in $q\n",
		"$q.y",         "error(63): A.g4:7:4: unknown attribute reference q in $q.y\n",
		"$q = 3",       "error(63): A.g4:7:4: unknown attribute reference q in $q\n",
		"$q = 3;",      "error(63): A.g4:7:4: unknown attribute reference q in $q = 3;\n",
		"$q.y = 3;",    "error(63): A.g4:7:4: unknown attribute reference q in $q.y = 3;\n",
		"$q = $blort;", "error(63): A.g4:7:4: unknown attribute reference q in $q = $blort;\n" +
						"error(63): A.g4:7:9: unknown attribute reference blort in $blort\n",
		"$a.ick",       "error(65): A.g4:7:6: unknown attribute ick for rule a in $a.ick\n",
		"$a.ick = 3;",  "error(65): A.g4:7:6: unknown attribute ick for rule a in $a.ick = 3;\n",
		"$b.d",         "error(64): A.g4:7:6: cannot access rule d's parameter: $b.d\n",  // can't see rule ref's arg
		"$d.text",      "error(63): A.g4:7:4: unknown attribute reference d in $d.text\n", // valid rule, but no ref
		"$lab.d",		"error(64): A.g4:7:8: cannot access rule d's parameter: $lab.d\n",
	};

Yep, makes sense. I think we can still go with methods for now. In the end, we might find some good uses for a simple gUnit translator to jUnit cases. But, we can add that later. I'm just trying to figure out what I get into the 1st release.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Failing parser rule test in GUnit
Message-ID: <4FA1455F.2050705@gmail.com>

Hi there

I'am using GUnit together with maven to test my grammar. The setup was 
pretty easy due to good information from: 
http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/gUnit+-+Maven+Integration

But I am sticking now with the test on parser rules. I have the 
following grammar.

---- grammar.g------------
grammar TParser;

options {
   language = Java;
   output   = AST;
}

@header {
package antlr.test;
}

@lexer::header {
package antlr.test;
}

builtInType
   :
   LITERAL_int
   ;


PATTERN_TYPE
   :
   'IPattern'
   ;

LITERAL_int
   :
   'int'
   ;

-------------------------------

and the follwoing test file:


------ test.gunit --------------
gunit TParser;

@header{package antlr.test;}

//test parser rules
builtInType:
"int" OK

// test lexical rules
PATTERN_TYPE:
"IPattern" OK

LITERAL_int:
"int" OK

----------------------------------

the tests for the lexer work as expected, but the parser rule test does 
not pass although I think they should. The output of maven starting with 
the command: "mvn test" is as follows:

Failed tests:   testBuiltInType1(TestTParser): testing rule builtInType 
expected:<OK> but was:<FAIL, >

Why does this parser rule test fail?

The version I use are:
Antlr: 3.4
antlr-runtime: 3.4
gunit: 3.4
jUnit: 3.8.1

It would be nice to receive some hints on this behaviour. A similar 
situation, that a parsing rule test did not succeed, I found here: 
http://antlr.1301665.n2.nabble.com/gUnit-help-needed-td6391239.html but 
without a solution.
The situation I am faceing might be similar?

thanks,
Martin

Dear All,

Sorry to bother you with this presumably trivial question regarding the libantlr3c-3.4 target of ANTLR.

I generated the C code for the SimpleCalc example from

http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Five+minute+introduction+to+ANTLR+3

where I only changed the line

input  = antlr3AsciiFileStreamNew          ((pANTLR3_UINT8)argv[1]);

to

input  = antlr3FileStreamNew          ((pANTLR3_UINT8)argv[1], ANTLR3_ENC_8BIT);

in order to make the code compilable. The code works as expected if I run it on a correct input (e.g. "3+4"). If I run it on an incorrect input, however, (e.g. "+4"), the code gives the output

test.txt(1)  : error 9 : org.antlr.runtime.UnwantedTokenExceptionSegmentation fault: 11

("test.txt" is the input file.) I expected to see the "error 9" statement, but the "Segmentation fault" surprises me. Could somebody please point out how to amend the generated code so that it throws exceptions without resulting in segmentation faults?

Thanks a lot,
Shen

Subject: [antlr-interest] string template v4 list of object iteration
Message-ID: <4FA2BD05.8050708@cordic.com>

Hi All

(finally my interest list confirmation mail turned up :) )

I have used stringtemplatev3 in one of my .net project

in v3, if I have arraylist of objects I can iterate thru the list by
in my html page ,

<table>
$arrayListOfPersons :{ p |
<tr><td>p.name</td></tr>
<tr><td>p.age</td></tr>
}$
</table>

where person class is declared in java

class persons{
public String getName();
public int getAge();
...
}

List<persons>  ps = new ArrayList<persons>();
add persons to ps

but now I am using a string template group file(.stg) with stringtempate V4
I am getting exception on above html table iteration code
some of the stack trace says
can't load group file
Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: java.util.ArrayList
at org.antlr.runtime.tree.BaseTreeAdaptor.addChild(BaseTreeAdaptor.java:107)
at org.stringtemplate.v4.compiler.STParser.mapExpr(STParser.java:3508)

at the same time I can list an array of string like this $contents; separator="<br/>"$


(we use $ for delimiters in v3 and v4)

how do I iterate a list of object in a list in ST version 4 using string template group file?
is my syntax is wrong ? I can provide more info about java classes/more stack trace etcetc (someoneelse in my team wrote it)
if required

any help/tips would be greatful
thanks in advance

 when you load the v4 .stg file the you specify $? is not the default.

Also, why are you posting this to the ANTLR's list instead of the string template list?

Hi Antlr-Interest,

I think that my first order logic grammar is ready. I want to upload it
to the antlr grammar collection, if you don't protest, because of any
problem with the grammar.

Best Regards,
  Stephan

Subject: [antlr-interest] Segmentation fault for
	org.antlr.runtime.UnwantedTokenException in libantlr3c-3.4
Message-ID: <4182838C-F421-4EE2-A458-2D640FC8AC55@gmail.com>

Dear All,

Sorry to bother you with this presumably trivial question regarding the libantlr3c-3.4 target of ANTLR.

I generated the C code for the SimpleCalc example from

http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Five+minute+introduction+to+ANTLR+3

where I only changed the line

input  = antlr3AsciiFileStreamNew          ((pANTLR3_UINT8)argv[1]);

to

input  = antlr3FileStreamNew          ((pANTLR3_UINT8)argv[1], ANTLR3_ENC_8BIT);

in order to make the code compilable. The code works as expected if I run it on a correct input (e.g. "3+4"). If I run it on an incorrect input, however, (e.g. "+4"), the code gives the output

test.txt(1)  : error 9 : org.antlr.runtime.UnwantedTokenExceptionSegmentation fault: 11

("test.txt" is the input file.) I expected to see the "error 9" statement, but the "Segmentation fault" surprises me. Could somebody please point out how to amend the generated code so that it throws exceptions without resulting in segmentation faults?

Thanks a lot,
Shen

ANTLR v4 https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/downloads

ANTLR Works v2 http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR4/1.+Overview

Remember these are pre-Alpha so don't expect them to work or to get much if
any support.

Message-ID: <1336156089.34149.YahooMailNeo@web161401.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Hello:

I posted this message on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10422421/linq-like-expressions-library-for-java-with-the-ability-to-compile-expression-tr, however, I haven't received any answer. Since you are the experts in the area related to parsing/compiling code I thought of asking the question here as well.

I am aware that compiling code to java bytecode is achieved by quite a bit of java libraries/utilities that implement languages, starting with the java compiler (javac), jython, velocity etc, there are bytecode manipulation libraries, ASM, BCEL etc. What I am looking for is a library that would allow me to compile to bytecode expressions similar with System.Linq.Expressions. I don't want to reinvent the wheel and I don't have time to write code optimizers and so on, that is all those steps that are done after the code is parsed. I was wondering of there is any java library that I can tap into to achieve this.

Thanks

Hi Costa,


What I am about to say has to be taken with a grain of salt.

I take it that you are after something like F# Code Quotations See:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233212.aspx, and these in some
way extend back to LISP macros. If we come back up that tree on the Java
side you will encounter Scala. When looking for adding LINQ support to
Scala, I came across this. See:
http://scalamacros.org/talks/2011-10-18-WhatsUp.pdf . After a quick reading
it looks like these people want to go the same way the F# people are with
type providers. See:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh156509(v=vs.110).aspx

While this is not an answer hopefully it sheds enough light on the
situation to look for branches off of it to find your answer.

Hi,

I just saw that the reason for the described behaviour is fixed in antlr
version 3.4.1-SNAPSHOT.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Interesting error in attribute access
Message-ID: <CAK3hZ7RfHK4H7FQ3SUZ91qJO7mqSXfrZGf14-uGPaLLo5MP_=g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

My grammar is as follows

A = blah blah (X|Y)?   // I can have one or none X , Y but not both

Now my grammar is as follows :

A :  blah blah (x=X|y=Y)?
 -> {$x ==  null } ^(tok_blah X)
-> {$y == null} ^(tok_blah Y)
->   ^ (tok_blah)
;

When I compile my grammar .. It raises "missing attribute access on rule
scope" ..I googled a bit and changed my grammar to the following

A :  blah blah (x=X|y=Y)?
 -> {$x.text ==  null } ^(tok_blah X)
-> {$y.text == null} ^(tok_blah Y)
->   ^ (tok_blah)
;

and now the grammar compiles correctly. When I give the input as  "blah
blah X" .. it parses it correctly ..However if I give
"blah blah Y" .. it fails ...I am using java and I looked into the source
of the code generated by grammar.

The code is trying to access attribute "text" of null variable $x without
checking if $x is null.  Any workaround for this error?

I need to check it the variable $x is null instead of checking if its
'text" attribute is null. Any help is highly appreciated.

Thanks and Regards,

Use:

r
@init {
bool haveX = false;
bool haveY = false;
: (x=X { haveX = true; } | y=Y {haveY = true; }

...

But why not just

-> ^(TOK_BLAH $x? $y?)

As only one will be present.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Trying to get an AST in C#. Not working - could
	use a sanity check.
Message-ID: <02c801cd2be7$116a20a0$343e61e0$@highpointsoftware.com>

Hi;

 

I?ll preface with ?I am a first time Lexer/Parser generator user, but a long
time software guy.? That, of course, makes me a ?noob.?

 

I?m preparing to build an analysis and round-trip engineering tool in C# for
a 3rd party system with its own syntax. I believe I can create the
foundation of a persistence layer to and from their custom format through an
ANTLR grammar. In order to work out the kinks, I?ve begun a proof-of-concept
on a simple analogue. One thing it needs to do is support an N-ary AST where
N>2, but I think I have reasonable rewrite rules in place to bring that
about.

 

The challenge has been in getting an AST generated from even that simple
grammar. I have a grammar that passes code generation from ANTLRWorks, and
code (see attached) that seems to have worked for others, in regards to
generating an AST.

 

It may have to do with the versions of ANTLRWorks and the ANTLR C# runtimes
that I?m linking to. I?ve tried:

ANTLR 3.1.0 C# Runtimes version (3.1.0.39271) & ANTLRWorks 1.4.3 : Odd
partial parsing ? skips or duplicates some children.

ANTLR 3.4.1 C# Runtimes version (3.4.1.9004) & ANTLRWorks 1.4.3 : Generated
lexer issues (_channel=HIDDEN ?not defined) and program issues
(MarblesParser.parse() inaccessible and MarblesParser.parse_return not
defined.)

 

So my question is - *Should* either of these configurations work? (I?ve seen
posts hinting that certain builds of ANTLR C# runtime are not
fully-featured, and I?m also wondering if there might have been breaking
changes between 3.1.0.x and 3.4.1.x such that my source needs to change to
support a different model.)

 

If things *should* work as I?ve got ?em, I?ve inlined the grammar, the
sample input and the Program.cs below in case anyone cares to beat me about
the head and shoulders for some noob-ish-nesses. J 

 

[Note: A sack of marbles was the initial concept. You?ll see below, we?ve
now graduated to bags of hammers & boxes of rocks. A subject of which I am
currently feeling quite exemplary.]

 

In any case, thanks in advance for whatever help you can offer.

 

Regards, (code after the .sig)

Peter,

Change HIDDEN to Hidden.  The C# target attempts to use C# idioms when possible.  Also, look at http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Antlr3CSharpReleases.

Subject: Trying to get an AST in C#. Not working - could use a sanity check.

 

Hi;

 

I'll preface with "I am a first time Lexer/Parser generator user, but a long time software guy." That, of course, makes me a "noob."

 

I'm preparing to build an analysis and round-trip engineering tool in C# for a 3rd party system with its own syntax. I believe I can create the foundation of a persistence layer to and from their custom format through an ANTLR grammar. In order to work out the kinks, I've begun a proof-of-concept on a simple analogue. One thing it needs to do is support an N-ary AST where
N>2, but I think I have reasonable rewrite rules in place to bring that
about.

 

The challenge has been in getting an AST generated from even that simple grammar. I have a grammar that passes code generation from ANTLRWorks, and code (see attached) that seems to have worked for others, in regards to generating an AST.

 

It may have to do with the versions of ANTLRWorks and the ANTLR C# runtimes that I'm linking to. I've tried:

ANTLR 3.1.0 C# Runtimes version (3.1.0.39271) & ANTLRWorks 1.4.3 : Odd partial parsing - skips or duplicates some children.

ANTLR 3.4.1 C# Runtimes version (3.4.1.9004) & ANTLRWorks 1.4.3 : Generated lexer issues (_channel=HIDDEN ?not defined) and program issues
(MarblesParser.parse() inaccessible and MarblesParser.parse_return not
defined.)

 

So my question is - *Should* either of these configurations work? (I've seen posts hinting that certain builds of ANTLR C# runtime are not fully-featured, and I'm also wondering if there might have been breaking changes between 3.1.0.x and 3.4.1.x such that my source needs to change to support a different model.)

 

If things *should* work as I've got 'em, I've inlined the grammar, the sample input and the Program.cs below in case anyone cares to beat me about the head and shoulders for some noob-ish-nesses. J 

 

[Note: A sack of marbles was the initial concept. You'll see below, we've now graduated to bags of hammers & boxes of rocks. A subject of which I am currently feeling quite exemplary.]

 

In any case, thanks in advance for whatever help you can offer.

 

Regards, (code after the .sig)

Subject: [antlr-interest] Day 2: Trying to get an AST in C#. Progress,
	but still not working.
Message-ID: <032501cd2c96$92b0f6c0$b812e440$@highpointsoftware.com>

PROGRESS! Thanks, Kevin Carroll.

It now compiles and runs, so we're getting somewhere. So far, I have ...
- Renamed two HIDDEN keywords in MarblesLexer.cs (i.e. hidden channel) to
Hidden. (Is this due to a bug, or an error in my input?)
- Made my parse rule public so it could be called.
- Updated my parsing code to call 
	AstParserRuleReturnScope<object,IToken> ParseReturn =
Parser.parse();

Now, I get a parse tree, but it appears that the second and then the third
Box and Rock are overwriting the first. I debug into the parser's execution,
and I can see the BOX token with three ROCK tokens, so I'm wondering why
they're not making it into the AST. 

Anyway, I only get

ROOT
  BOX
    ROCK
      COLOR
        "Black"
      WEIGHT
        23
      R_TYPE
        "Quartz"

Where I expect to get a ROOT with 3 BOXes, and 3 ROCKs in each BOX and
properties under each ROCK.

To remind, my grammar is as follows - can anyone point out my error? (If you
need the input file contents, it's included in yesterday's email. Didn't
want to unnecessarily clog up the email tubes...

With that parse rule you will get only the last instance of the BRANCH 
token. You should collect it into a list and then reference the list in 
the rewrite rule. See below an excerpt of a grammar that builds two 
statement lists "tList" and "eList" and uses them in the rewrite rule:

/**	"IfStatement"
	*/
ifStat:
	'IF' cond=condRoot 'THEN' tList+=statement*
	('ELSE' eList+=statement*)? 'FIN'
		-> ^('IF' $cond SLIST $tList* ^('ELSE' SLIST $eList*)?)
	;

I think the following rule will do it for you (observe the '+' between 
"r" and "=BRANCH"):

public parse

      :  ( r+=BRANCH )* EOF ->  ^(ROOT $r*)
      ;


I hope that helps,

FYI Google groups can be awkward.  I use it for a few community groups
and right now am dealing with a problem inviting someone to be on the
list, apparently you only get to invite them once.  I see people first
uninvite and then re-invite, but can't see any way to do that through
my interface...just my two cents.

It may work better for groups that let people manage their own
subscriptions instead of being invited.  In general I've not been
impressed with google groups, but I don't have anything better to
recommend either.

Message-ID: <CAJ8SgH=m5Eq+rQ-4dAE1+yg-Tras_9NKDpRy3ACH6N1H1fW-Hg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Playing with ANTLR and ANTLRworks is a very educative experience.
I was wondering if what ANTLR does to parse sentences (strings) from a
language (set of strings), could be generalized to parsing graphs from
graph languages. Then I recently found
http://www.odysci.com/article/1010112992272431.

What holds me back the most from using parsers or compiler middle
ends, is the huge hidden complexity in application specific
representation of information: there is much more than the parse tree
or abstract syntax tree, every applications stores specific kinds of
information in specialized structures.
In general I view (intended) information to be graphlike, where people
have agreed to linearize/tree-ify for purpouse of communication
(between humans, or humans and software, i.e. a compiler). Compilers
do not store everything it knows about code it is compiling in one big
graph for multiple (performance?) reasons. For example scopes and
other information are stored in specific structures. When I want to
automate a kind of transformation (or even mere visualization) of
code, I really just want this single graph vs a parse tree or AST.
This may necessitate some ontology for the information at hand (i.e.
the ontology would be an implicit part of the API agreement between
parser/compiler middle end and the user). It would then be up to the
user to only use the subgraph it is interested in (this way the user
only needs to learn 1) the specific "ontology" and 2) how to perform
manipulations on the graph) as opposed to learning the applications
multiple specialized data structures, and finding out how to gain
access to them, let alone use them correctly.

Are there any (open source) tools similar too ANTLR (in terms of
cleanness and functionality) which output graphs instead of parse
trees or AST's, or which can parse graphs as in the mentioned paper?

greetings

Hi,

can somebody help me with my little problem? I want to say something
like this:

implication: formula '->' formula -> '!' formula OR formula;

How do I identify the two different formulas?

Hi,

thx for the advice. You were right saying that I want ^(OR  ^(NOT
$f1)$f2)...

Now I have a little NoViableAltException with this Rule:

 9 formula	
10	:	f1=(NOT^? LPAREN! formula RPAREN!
11		| 	((FORALL^ | EXISTS^) VARIABLE)formula
12		) ( IMPLY f2=formula -> ^(OR  ^(NOT $f1) $f2))*;

The exception is about line 12.

[14:46:04] error(100): Test.g:12:27: syntax error: antlr:
NoViableAltException(77@[921:1: rewrite_alternative options {k=1; } :
({...}? => rewrite_template | {...}? => ( rewrite_element )+ ->

rewrite_element )+ EOA["<end-of-alt>"] ) | -> ^( ALT[LT(1),"ALT"]

Any suggestions? :)

My first guess would be

public parse :  branches EOF -> ^(ROOT branches);

branches: (BRANCH)*;

Does that help?

Subject: [antlr-interest] Cannot find symbol UP?
Message-ID: <4FABD339.2060303@gmx.net>

Hi,

today I tried to add implication and biimplication to my first order
logic grammar. The code can be generated, but when I press "Debug",
ANTLRWorks throws and error:

Test3Parser.java:1218: cannot find symbol
symbol  : variable UP
location: class Test3Parser
                else if ( (LA6_1==EOF||(LA6_1 >= UP && LA6_1 <=
BIIMPLY)||LA6_1==IMPLY||LA6_1==OR||LA6_1==RPAREN) ) {

Do you have any Idea how to solve this problem? As far as I understand,
it must have something to do with my parser rule "formula":

formula	:	f1=( ^(NOT atomic)
	|	atomic
	|	^(NOT LPAREN f3=formula RPAREN) -> ^(NOT $f3)
	|	LPAREN f3=formula RPAREN  -> $f3
	|	disjunction
	| 	^(FORALL VARIABLE formula)
	|	^(EXISTS VARIABLE formula)
	)	((IMPLY f2=formula -> ^(OR  ^(NOT $f1) $f2)) |	(BIIMPLY f2=formula ->
^(AND ^(OR  ^(NOT $f1) $f2) ^(OR  ^(NOT $f2) $f1))))?;

Please find the complete grammar attached.

  Stephan

Subject: [antlr-interest] Workarounding multiple alternatives
Message-ID: <4FABD657.2010008@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to use tree grammars to implement several replacement rules.
My AST represents mathematical formulas and I want to do things like
x * x^-1  ->  I (replace "x" and "x inverse" by identity)

Obviously, I want to replace such a pattern within any (longer)
multiplication.

My current approach (this one for orthogonal matrices) looks as follows:

topdown
    : ^( MULT (before += .)* x=. ^( POW y=. TRANS ) (after += .)* )
        { $x.equals($y) && $x.has("ORTHOGONAL") }?
            -> ^( MULT $before? SYMBOL["I"] $after? )
;

Sure enough, antlr complains about the nondeterministic decision (before
and after can both take arbitrarily many nodes), but I have no idea left
how to fix this.
Can you give me some hint, how this could be implemented?

Thanks,
Gereon

The best answer I got (thanks, David Turvey & Stefan M?tje)

 

Was:

 

public parse

    :  (r+=BRANCH|r+=BRUNCH)* EOF -> ^(ROOT $r*)

    ;

 

I'm off and running into new territory, preparing my next antlr-interest

My first guess would be

 

public parse :  branches EOF -> ^(ROOT branches);

 

branches: (BRANCH)*;

 

Does that help?

Subject: [antlr-interest] name of generated parser
Message-ID: <DCAD06F0-BB23-40BA-811A-9671A0232631@udel.edu>

According to the ANTLR book, if I have a parser grammar T (so the file containing this grammar is called "T.g" and the first line of the file is "parser grammar T;"), then the generated parser should be called TParser.java (I'm using the Java target).  However, when I generate the parser using AntlrWorks I instead get a file (and class) name T.java.  I haven't tried it from the command line but I assume I'll get the same result.  Anyone have any ideas why, or what I can do about it?
Thanks,
Steve

There are 4 types of grammars:

   1. a combined grammar, `grammar T;`, generates a parser and lexer called
   `TParser.java` and `TLexer.java` respectively;
   2. a parser grammar, `parser grammar TP;`, generates `TP.java`;
   3. a lexer grammar, `lexer grammar TL;`, generates `TL.java`;
   4. a tree grammar, `tree grammar TT;`, generates `TT.java`.

Regards,

Bart.

I looked into the list of Grammar List
Tried some C.g and CPP.g but I can't find any grammar that help me convert C
file to an AST.
I need that in java so I could walk through the AST and rewrite it in
another language.
Could you post some C.g that I could use ANTLR to convert them in to
tokens,parser,lexer file?
Thanks a lot.
Currently I use ANSI C grammar for ANTLR v3 but I can't not make it run in
my java project?

Hi,

so solve this issue, I had to rewrite the following alternatives of the
formula rule:

Alternative ^(NOT LPAREN f3=formula RPAREN) -> ^(NOT $f3)
transformed to NOT LPAREN f3=formula RPAREN -> ^(NOT $f3)

Alternative ^(FORALL VARIABLE formula)
transformed to FORALL VARIABLE formula -> ^(FORALL VARIABLE formula)

Alternative ^(EXISTS VARIABLE formula)
transformed to EXISTS VARIABLE formula -> ^(EXISTS VARIABLE formula)

Subject: [antlr-interest] ANTLRWorks destroys its AST
Message-ID: <4FACCBBF.8070905@gmx.net>

Dear ANTLR-Interest Group,

I have two grammars, which are almost the same and an example input: A &
B | C & !A | (D | E) & F

The first grammar works quite nice, the other grammar generates NIL as
AST. However, next to the last step in debugging both grammars produced
exactly the same ParseTree and exactly the same AST.

Just after the consumption of <EOF> the other grammar throws the
computed AST away.

Is it just a ANTLRWorks problem or does anybody know, what I am doing
wrong. The only difference between the two grammars is the additional
abbreviation rule.

Please find the two grammars in the attachment.

Best Regards,
  Stephan

I have a very simple grammar (attached, but here's the relevant part):


start
	:	(simple_expression | dotted_identifier)*
	;

simple_expression
	:	'XYZ' 'HAHA'
	;

identifier
	:	ID	
   	;

dotted_identifier
	:	identifier ( DOT identifier )*
	;

It pretty much works as expected, accepting "XYZ HAHA", "BLAH.TEST"
and "ABC".  But when I try to parse "XYZ.A" or "A.XYZ" it gets
confused trying to apply simple_expression to 'XYZ'.  I don't
understand why this is happening.  Shouldn't backtracking tear right
through this?

Thanks!

Do not use 'XYZ'. Create a token in the lexer:

XYZ : 'XYZ' ;

And declare it before your ID rule. Do this for all the literals in your
parser grammar.

Try taking out the backtrack, k, and memorize options. You should not use
backtrack unless you have no choice and you are usually better letting
ANTLR deal with k. Have you followed the getting started articles in the
wiki?

The reason the options are there is because I'm working with a much
larger grammar which I didn't write, but am trying to modify.
Removing them doesn't make a difference.

ANTLR does not backtrack across the Parser-Lexer interface.

So as soon as the Lexer recognizes string "XYZ" as the keyword in your
grammar 'XYZ' it can never be (re-)considered to be an ID token.

Please search the mailing list archives for "keywords as identifiers" or
other similar searches for the ways around this issue.

Hope this helps...

Summary: your abbreviation rule has 3 paths for recognition.
You have supplied '->' rules for only 2 of the paths.

because you have not told ANTLR what to do with that tree.

abbreviation :

      ( ( /* EMPTY */ -> $f1 )
      | ( IMPLY f2=formula -> ^(OR ^(NOT $f1) $f2) )
      | ( BIIMPLY f2=formula ->

Hi,

your advice worked like a charm. Thank you!

Does anybody know how I can replace the grammar I uploaded with the new
one? I am talking about the grammar repository on antlr.org

Best Regards,
  Stephan

Yo yo yo,

For the release of ANTLR v4, I would like to redesign the ANTLR project websites. I really only need 2 pages: homepage and second-level page, which is what I have now.

I contacted the person that did the original design, but she is wisely ignoring my e-mail (since I am a bastard!). Can anyone on the list recommend a designer? That person does not necessarily need to be able to convert the design to html/css, but that would be a bonus. A good looking design is the key. If you have direct experience with or knowledge of a good webpage designer, please contact me directly.

I'm in the process of having an ANTLR project logo built.

Thanks!

Hello all,

  The lexer rule below simply matches a quoted string while allowing
escaped characters such as \\n. Any non-escaped control characters are an
error so I'd like to exit the rule when this happens but this doesn't seem
possible unless I use recursive calls to LoopChar instead of *.  I'm
wondering if there is better way to handle this without recursion.

//Quoted string
STR           : '\u0022' LoopChar* '\u0022';

fragment LoopChar :
   '\u0000'..'\u001F'   {ctx->dirLexerError();} //Exit rule here

Terrence,

I would recommend a colleague James Hambly in a heartbeat, not only is
he talented but very reasonable as well. We have used him for our own
website in the past (www.existsolutions.com).

You can find his details here - http://www.jameshambly.com/

He can also produce perfect HTML or XHTML and CSS for you.

Don't try to use the lexer to 'parse' the token. Just accept and escape
character, then when the closing quote is seen, look through the
characters you have collected and issue an error message if any are
incorrect. Then you can accumulate the errors, but still make the token
and get as far through your process as possible. It does not really make
any sense to just error out in the token - what do you do next, just stop?
In general, always try and accumulate as many errors as possible in one go
and don't make your users re-run your process after every single error :)

Subject: [antlr-interest] please help understand strange backtracking
	behavior
Message-ID: <CAC9wkvj716jKjPktwitjfDDLqFf8ufgTHMA-iq9N0Vb7AF-Fjw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm working on a proof of concept SQL parsing grammar, which for now
relies on backtracking.
I'm running into a strange issue which I can't understand and hope
someone can take a look at it and shed some light for me.
I've produced what I think is the minimal grammar demonstrating this
problem and it is attached.

I'm trying to parse the expression
TEST(1) BETWEEN 1 AND 4

using the condition_expr rule.

What I expect to happen:
ANTLR should
try  condition_is alternative and fail, backtrack and
try condition_is_a_set alternative and fail, backtack and
try condition_between alternative
match TEST(1) as an expr of type function_call with an argument
followed by BETWEEN 1 and 4

What happens:
It tries condition_is and condition_is_a_set and they fail to match,
backtracks and tries to match condition_between, however it goes on a
weird tangent of trying to match the function_call as keyCOUNT and
fails.
I don't understand:
1) why this happens
2) why does it stop happening as soon as I make a smallest tweak to
the grammar (e.g. removing condition_is_a_set alternative, or
replacing keyCOUNT with a 'COUNT')
3) what is the easiest way of figuring out problems like this?

I'm going to attach a screenshot of the failed parse tree, perhaps
someone can figure out what is going on by just looking at it w/o
having to run this stuff.

Thank you!!

Hi all,
I get a XMLLexer cannot be resolved to a type at the following Java line of code:?XMLLexer lex = new XMLLexer(input);
I am importing both:
import org.antlr.runtime.*;import org.antlr.runtime.tree.*;
The imports are fine, no errors there. I added antlr-3.4.jar file on the build path using Eclipse. But I still get error when trying to use XMLLexer, XMLParser or?XMLTreeParser.
Isn't it enough to add antlr jar file? Do I need something else? I cannot find any documentation regarding this. Can someone point me to one?
Thank you,Oana.

No it is not. This jar doesn't contain the lexers/parsers for all known 
languages. Your imports only reference the ANTLR runtime which only 
supports the lexers and parsers generated by the ANTLR tool from a 
grammar file on behalf of you.

Do I need something else?

You need to specify an ANTLR grammar file *.g that can be used to build 
appropriate source code in Java for your language problem. This is then
translated to class files that could provide a XMLLexer class for instance.

I cannot find any documentation regarding this.

Start with the main page www.antlr.org. This also links to the 
documentation page with a link to the command line options.

Use the getting started page at
http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/FAQ+-+Getting+Started

On that page is also a link "Parsing XML" to
http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Parsing+XML

which  talks about XML stuff.

Checkout the ANTLR example downloads at
http://www.antlr.org/download.html which contain at least the grammar of 
an XML lexer. (Look for "sample grammars").

There is also a grammars list at
http://www.antlr.org/grammar/list

Can someone point me to one?
> Thank you,Oana.

This should give you a starting point.

Best regards,

Subject: [antlr-interest] resolving ambiguity
Message-ID: <FF45013F-04CD-42B4-9D43-29D19D99E248@udel.edu>

In the following grammar:

-----------------------------------------------
grammar g1;
options { output=AST; }
tokens { B_CHAIN; }
r	:	(A | b_chain)*;
b_chain	:	B+ -> ^(B_CHAIN B+);
A 	:	'A';
B	:	'B';

// BB should yield ^(BCHAIN B B)
-----------------------------------------------

there is an ambiguity since input "BB" could be parsed as (1) two "b_chain"s (each with one "B") or as (2) one b_chain (with two "B"s).  I want to tell ANTLR to choose option (2).

Right now, I get this warning:

-------------------------------------
[11:45:02] Checking Grammar g1.g...
[11:45:02] warning(200): g1.g:5:11: 
Decision can match input such as "B" using multiple alternatives: 1, 2

As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input
-------------------------------------

Does anyone know how to resolve the ambiguity?

Thanks,
Steve

hi Steve, it will match greedily so that b_chain will match all B's in a row.

Thanks, Ter.  That's true, but the warnings are scary -- or at least suggest I'm not doing something quite right -- and I want to make them go away.  (This is an abstraction of a much larger grammar where I ran into this problem.  In the larger grammar, there are a bunch of such warnings.)   Is there a way to tell ANTLR that I want that behavior, so don't warn me?

Hi Stephen,

Explicitly tell ANTLR to match B's greedily:

b_chain : (options{greedy=true;}: B)+ -> ^(B_CHAIN B+);


For input "BB", it will cause the tree ^(B_CHAIN B B) to be created, and
ANTLR will not produce warnings when generating the parser.

Regards,

Bart.

Subject: [antlr-interest] wanted: multiple result ASTs
Message-ID: <FA21EA835C1467498B3E0B904C9CF2020E6CB4C5@TK5EX14MBXC113.redmond.corp.microsoft.com>

I'm fairly new to ANTLR; please bear with me if this has been asked before.

I am looking for a way to have ANTLR generate multiple result trees from my grammar, in order NOT to resolve ambiguity. Suppose I have a grammar that is "incomplete" or ambiguous, in that for some input text, there can be more than one "valid" way of parsing the input. (This is particularly useful in natural language parsing.) What I would like is to have rules that can collect all of these result ASTs-a list of ASTs, not just one AST. At the end of a successful parse run, there would then be a list of trees.

I know this is not a typical need, particularly with formal languages. But I am looking to apply ANTLR for some natural language parsing.

Any tips or pointers will be much appreciated. So far I do not see any easy way of doing this with ANTLR, but maybe there is some way of hacking in actions or the like.

Thanks.
Scobie

You need:

((B)=> B)+

And even then you will sometimes just shift the warning elsewhere. This
does incur a single token predicate overhead of course, but in reality
that costs nothing. I usually find that such things as this mean that
grammar is not structured correctly, and though sometimes the language you
are parsing means that there is no way to structure it properly, there
quite often is.

Hi Scobie,

I have never written a parser for natural language yet, but from working
with Artificial Intelligence and PROLOG, that is where I would focus my
search. In particular, PROLOG will generate multipule results for a given
query. So if the input is ambiguios, there would be multiple ways to match
against the rules, and the results would be each way that the PROLOG
program matched the rules against the input.

Hope that helps,
Eric

Hi,


How can I get the node returned by a rewrite rule? I want to be able to use
to this node in the @after section by writing something like this:

rule:
  @after {
    // use the node B here
  }
  : A -> B;

I've used ANTLRWorks occasionally the last year but just recently reloaded OS X so had to reinstall. For whatever reason pipes (vertical bars, i.e. ' | ' ) fail to show up completely in any grammar I load or write. Literally just don't show up at all, even though they are correctly parsed and can be copy/pasted in/out.

Anyone have a clue why? Searching for this issue has proven difficult as you can imagine. I've removed and reinstalled twice to no avail.

Hi Jay,

ANTLRWorks may be using a system font that it has problems displaying. Try
changing the font and/or size of the font.

Subject: [antlr-interest] How do you include a constant string in an AST?
Message-ID: <000001cd3cdd$436cdfa0$ca469ee0$@net>

I'm confused over what the phrase "... what my generator expects" might
mean. 

I'll take a swing at this anyway, assuming that you don't know how to turn
the string "ItemID" into a token on the fly by dropping into Java in the
middle of a rule using braces {}. This all assumes that you're using ANTLR
3.4 to generate a java parser. Choose some token name you already have
defined or define a new one in the tokens {} option, for example IDENTIFIER,
then try this:

linkItemID: linkPredicate '(' PROPERTIES ',' string ')' 
  -> ^(linkPredicate PROPERTIES ^(Eql {new CommonTree(new
CommonToken(IDENTIFIER,"ItemID"))} string))
I don't know if that can be simplified to 
linkItemID: linkPredicate '(' PROPERTIES ',' string ')' 
  -> ^(linkPredicate PROPERTIES ^(Eql {new CommonToken(IDENTIFIER,"ItemID")}
string))

I didn't run this through ANTLR, so after you debug it be sure to let us
know what actually works. CommonTree() and CommonToken() are just
constructors in the CommonTree.java and CommonToken.java files in the
org.antlr.runtime package, so you can look there to understand exactly what
they do, and you can look in the Java parser that ANTLR creates to see
exactly how ANTLR defines your linkItemID rule; I recommend a search for the
exact phrase that you include inside the braces to get you to the right part
of the rule quickly.

And if I'm not even in the ballpark, try stating your question a different
way or giving us more detail.

Subject: [antlr-interest] How to intersperse #line directives into
 expressions and statements?
Message-ID: <1338271586033-7578122.post@n2.nabble.com>

Hi! 

I am trying to parse #line directives within expressions and statements, so
I can tag the nodes in the AST with the line numbers in the #line
directives. For example 

#line 10 
if ( 
#line 20 
x 
#line 30 
> 
#line 40 
0 
) 

would lead to an AST where the 'if' node is tagged with 10 and the 'x' node
is tagged with 20. 

First, I thought about writing a preprocessor, but this won't help, I think,
because the preprocessor has nothing to do with the AST. Adding this
behavior to the grammar isn't easy either, because the grammar had to accept
'#line INTLITERAL' nearly everywhere. 

Did anybody solve a similar problem and could offer any help? 

Cheers, 
Maik

Subject: [antlr-interest] Exploit ambiguity in tree rewriter
Message-ID: <4FC4A97E.2020009@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using tree rewriters to manipulate formulas that are represented as
ASTs. One operation I'd like to do is: "remove any identity from a
multiplication".

The replacement rule I'm currently working with is the following:

topdown :
	^( MULT (before += .)* x=. (after += .)* )
	{ $x.has("IDENTITY") }?
	-> ^( MULT $before* $after* )
;

As you probably see, we have some ambiguity here: before and after can
both take arbitrarily many elements. If I take an AST like
^( MULT A I x ), the replacement will not match. printing some debug
output reveals, that ANTLR will only check $x.has("IDENTITY"), i.e. will
only try to match the last element in a multiplication.
(That is actually not a surprise, as ANTLR issues a warning...)

Is there any way to resolve this ambiguity in a way, such that I can
match all occurrences?

Thanks,
Gereon

I'm working on an ANTLR-based C preprocessor/parser/tree.   All in Java.  It keeps track of the origin of every token (in addition to file, line number, and character index, the history of the token through macro expansions and #include directives).   This information will all be accessible through the AST.  At this point, the preprocessor is basically working.  If you or anyone else is interested in checking it out or contributing to its development, drop me a line.

I'm actually generating C++, but I have a syntax to AST grammar which I can easily debug in AntlrWorks and a tree processing grammar which connects to the C++ generator.  This allows me to easily debug the grammar using AntlrWorks.  If I have to drop into the target grammar, I will end up with multiple generator methods and just introduce specific AST nodes for this case.  I was hoping for some way of doing it without having to drop into the target language.  From the documentation it seemed like I could do this:



tokens {ItemID ;}

linkItemID: linkPredicate '(' PROPERTY ',' string ')' -> ^(linkPredicate PROPERTY ^(Eq ^(PropCollection ItemID[')', "ItemID"]) string));



This is the closest I've gotten, but I still get this error:

[15:48:41] D:\tau\ESearch\latest\QuerySyntax\output\QuerySyntaxParser.java:2352: cannot find symbol

I'm confused over what the phrase "... what my generator expects" might mean.



I'll take a swing at this anyway, assuming that you don't know how to turn the string "ItemID" into a token on the fly by dropping into Java in the middle of a rule using braces {}. This all assumes that you're using ANTLR

3.4 to generate a java parser. Choose some token name you already have defined or define a new one in the tokens {} option, for example IDENTIFIER, then try this:



linkItemID: linkPredicate '(' PROPERTIES ',' string ')'

  -> ^(linkPredicate PROPERTIES ^(Eql {new CommonTree(new CommonToken(IDENTIFIER,"ItemID"))} string)) I don't know if that can be simplified to

linkItemID: linkPredicate '(' PROPERTIES ',' string ')'

  -> ^(linkPredicate PROPERTIES ^(Eql {new CommonToken(IDENTIFIER,"ItemID")}

string))



I didn't run this through ANTLR, so after you debug it be sure to let us know what actually works. CommonTree() and CommonToken() are just constructors in the CommonTree.java and CommonToken.java files in the org.antlr.runtime package, so you can look there to understand exactly what they do, and you can look in the Java parser that ANTLR creates to see exactly how ANTLR defines your linkItemID rule; I recommend a search for the exact phrase that you include inside the braces to get you to the right part of the rule quickly.



And if I'm not even in the ballpark, try stating your question a different way or giving us more detail.

I have a rule like this:



linkItemID: linkPredicate '(' PROPERTIES ',' string ')' -> ^(linkPredicate PROPERTIES ^(Eql 'ItemID' string))



What I want is to rewrite the syntax into a specific form that involves a constant that is not matched on the left side.  So far I have not been able to figure out how to do this.  I know I could make it a token constant like Eql, but I want this form since it is what my generator expectes.  I have the ANTLR book and I've read through it several times... :)







Thanks!

I believe anywhere you use the Token[arg1, arg2] rewrite syntax, arg1
has to be a token reference. Java is giving you an error because it's
interpreting ')' as a char. You might be able to use $')' but if not,
try naming the token match with eg. a=')' and use ItemID[$a, ...].

My rules that use this syntax actually only used named tokens, eg.
BAR[$FOO, "0"].

See the FAQ in the Wiki on lexing . .. ? 4.5 and so on.



Backtracking won?t help the lexer and you should not use backtracking
unless forced to (there are some good reasons for it). Remember also that
the parser does not influence the lexer.



If this is all you want though, then:



fragment ELLIPSIS :;

DOT : '.'

     (   ('..')=> '.. ' { $type  = ELLIPSIS; }

       |

     )

;



Cheers,



Jim

Nice.  The only ones I'm not crazy about are the two which use the A icon
as a sub- or superscript.  The rest look great.  I think it's neat that the
A icon evokes inorder traversal and looks a bit like a stylized antler.

My vote would go for either "antlr-under-logo" or 4B3E. Have you tried 4B3E
with black lettering for the "NTLR" part?

That was my though exactly! (black "NTLR" letters in 4B3E)
Except now the circle in http://antlr.org/download/antlr-black-side.png is
quite a bit larger than 4B3E (I like is better if it's not that big...).

It's my favourite, too. However I'd change the height of the "A" in the
logo to the height of "NTLR". The circle might be a bit bigger, but only
a bit, I think that would be fine. Furthermore I suppose the logo is a
vector graphic such that it can used in whatever size is needed :-)

kind regards,
Johannes

I think I'd like to at least raise for consideration the following points:

Whether or not ANTLR aficionados like or dislike the proposed logos is only one aspect of logo choice. (Of course, we don't want to dislike it!)

First, here are some representative considerations.

So this has me asking, what are the design requirements that are fulfilled by the proposed designs, and on what principles are the designs based?

Pretending to be a naive viewer, I note that the most eye-catching feature is the red circle.  It has some some subtle gradients, suggesting that it is a sphere, though the sphere shape is not carried through to the letter projected upon it.  The red circle draws attention to the "A". In turn, the A has some pointy and triangley stylization that has been conspicuously applied, as though the special shape conveys something additional, though I've not understood what.

Although it is pleasant to look at, I find myself asking, how is any of this (the  red, the circle/sphere, the "A", the stylization) thematically related to the business of ANTLR?  Kyle mentioned: "I think it's neat that the A icon evokes in-order traversal and looks a bit like a stylized antler."  To be honest, I myself have difficulty seeing that. 

(Hmmm, now that I've stared at it *really* hard, the "A" has turned into an open safety pin of the kind used for diapers. ANTLR -- a tool to keep all that language cr*p in one place!)

Further, all the emphasis is on the "A", which in the acronym (ANother Tool for Language Recognition") is actually the least important word (though it is the letter which is emphasized when pronouncing "antler").  Some play on the "R" would make more sense from a semantic point of view.

There's also the aspect that though the acronym ANTLR has a long history with this project, the english word "antler" which it strongly alludes to is unrelated to the underlying quest, so that creates some additional cognitive noise, which is exacerbated by emphasizing the leading letter as though, despite the all-caps, Antlr is a proper name and not an acronym. 

Contrast with Flickr, which is not an acronym, and deviates from an actual english word by the same amount as ANTLR does, but the alluded-to word is much more related to its business. That logo commonly appears all-lower-case ("I'm not an acronym"), and with initial cap when written in narrative ("I'm a proper name").  (And I just now noticed that their logo actually emphasizes the last letter, though I don't know why!)

I don't know what to conclude from all this -- to me a distinctive red cricle seems as good as a distinctive blue square or a purple rectangle enclosing the whole acronym or whatever, but has not gone any further than that to communicate anything in particular, or with particular memorability. 

Perhaps there actually has been some clever thinking behind all this -- that would be interesting to hear.  (And do I have any better ideas at the moment? Nope.)

Finally, I would advocate some thought about how the color of the logo impacts on the color theme of other artifacts, most notably the website. Might be just fine, but it would be good to think that through now rather than discover a problem later.

+1

But it seems the logo is a bitmap exported to the PDF? I'd create a
vector graphic which can be enlarged without the aliasing effects and
loss of clarity, then it's great :-)

kind regards,
Johannes

Excellent points, Graham! 

Yep, was really just looking for something that could be associated with ANTLR visually.  I like the A all by itself even.

The artist and I did lots of back, forth and narrowed it down to this direction.

I don't think it has to mean anything.  E.g., our jguru logo:

http://www.jguru.com/images/jguru/logo.gif

was pretty cool but didn't mean anything.

As for website, i have a guy who will build a new look that will work wiht the new logo.

4B3E is my vote but modified so that the NTLR are in black. Then use the
stylized A in the red button everywhere there is a capital A

Definitely 4B3E, and I like Jim's suggestion of black for the rest of the

You know...with a stylin' logo like that, you could probably double the
price for ANTLR.  Oh...    :)   Seriously, it looks great!

Very interesting! My problem is that I am using C# and that I already have
compiler for a fairly complex grammar. Still I'd like to see how you've
solved the problem. Is the code available somewhere?

I like them both. You may find that you need to have a few permutations 
of the logo handy. I think that the rectangular 
(http://antlr.org/download/antlr-black2.pdf) one would look best on the 
header of the website, but in other places you will need to have a much 
more square logo. For example, if ANTLR were to have its own Facebook or 
Google+ page, they require a square image for the logo. The same goes 
for an application icon, or a favicon for the website. You will have to 
see in these cases if it looks better to just use the red circle by 
itself, or with ANTLR written underneath.

good points!  What about the app icon, github image, etc?  Ok, maybe  the big A then NTLR in black to the right and then just the big A for the icon?

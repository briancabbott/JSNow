<PRE>Thanks Gavin,

but ideally would want to be on hidden channel, and don't want to specify 
optional comments on every rule ?

does anyone know if this is possible in ANTLR, or is it a matter of coding 
a pre-processor to remove the nested comments ?

regards
Mark.

I've been developing a Sybase SQL stored proc parser using ANTLR3, and 
have run into the problem of dealing with nested comments 

e.g. 

/* 
select  * 
from hello  /* table*/ 
where 
field1 = 'world' /* field*/ 

*/ 

Ideally, I need to retain the line numbers whilst removing any nested 
comments, 

This is just air code, but:

MultiLineComment
  :  '/*'
     ( ('/*') =&gt; MultiLineComment
     | ~'*'
     | '*' ~'/'
     )*
     '*/'

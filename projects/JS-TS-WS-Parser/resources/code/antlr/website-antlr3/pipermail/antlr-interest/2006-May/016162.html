<PRE>Hi,
 
I'm also keenly interested in that.  There was a thread a while ago that V3 would improve in this area of C# code generation.  How is that progressing?  Also related is the need we have found (in Spring.NET) to lock at the highest level in order to perform expression evaluation in a multithreaded environment (i.e. ASP.NET) due to the use of static variables in the code.  There were some other reasons leading us in that direction, I'd have to dig up the details.
 
Cheers,
Mark

Subject: [antlr-interest] Goto instead of exceptions for normal parsing in C#



Antlr is wonderful!

Is there a trick to get Antlr to generate code that
uses goto instead of throwing exceptions for normal
parsing (not parse errors), using the C# generator?
The exceptions make it harder to debug.

Also is there any C# generator and non-java binary
builds for antlr 3 that can be downloaded?

Thanks,
Frank Hileman

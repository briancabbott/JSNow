True, I had simplified the matter.

</I>
Loosely speaking again, Java &quot;headers&quot; are precompiled.  A reference to
a class or interface will read in its .class file.  If that file does
not exist or is out of date wrt its source then it is compiled (once).

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;As soon as you make a java change you need to recalculate the dependency
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;tree using some tool.  That's not happening with the configure/make stuff
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;at the moment there is only the original dependencies.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;The Java compiler handles dependencies internally.  If you compile
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;just one file then all the .java files it references are compiled as

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;line.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Can get in trouble though if you compile one file that has a dependency

</I>&gt;<i>dependency itself is also specified on the command line.
</I>
Not true.  Here's a simple example of it working.

a/A.java:
package a;
import b.B;
class A {
   private B myB;
   public A() {
     myB = new B();
   }
}

b/B.java:
package b;
public class B {
   private int foo = 0;
   public B() {
     foo = 1;
   }
}

command line:
javac -classpath . a/A.java

results:
A.class is always generated.
B.class is generated if B.java is newer than it.

There is no explicit reference to B on the command line.

&gt;<i> &gt;The traditional way of compiling C/C++ one file at a time under make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;or similar is not well suited to Java.  It is best if javac can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;invoked once only during a build.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yes for sure - the javac compiler has to start up a jvm which is expensive,
</I>&gt;<i>some relief can be gained by using a compiler like jikes if you like 
</I>&gt;<i>makefiles.
</I>
My point is that all the work that is traditionally done by make
depend is done in javac.  Avoiding multiple JVM startups is a bonus.

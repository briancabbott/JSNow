&gt;<i> My feeling is that this analysis code dwarfs the symbol-table

</I>&gt;<i> methods which is just a small subset of a larger library.
</I>
A subset of a larger system, yes. The lexer and parser (part of the
[syntax] analysis phase) for instance would be larger in most language
processing projects.

&gt;<i> &gt; The AST searching can be done by specifying patterns to match in your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tree-grammar. AST transformations can be similarly accomplished.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right. The whole big question here is whether the ANTLR
</I>&gt;<i> (or any other) AST matching-and-replacement syntax can do
</I>&gt;<i> all sorts of complicated matching and transformations that
</I>&gt;<i> happen in real-world translation projects, AND whether it's
</I>&gt;<i> easier to specify in ANTLR than in Java (or C++, or whatever).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One example comes to mind: I replace printf() with System.out.println
</I>&gt;<i> if the last two characters in the first argument are &quot;\n&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> In Java, that's just &quot;if (arg1AST.getText().endsWith(&quot;\n&quot;)) {&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Now I'm sure there's no &quot;ANTLR-syntax&quot; for that sort of thing,
</I>&gt;<i> and the solution is &quot;just embed Java in that case&quot;.
</I>
- Specify a pattern to match FUNCTION_CALL subtrees or whatever
they're called.
- Embed action code that performs required semantic checks - e.g.
check that it is &quot;printf&quot; etc.
- Depending on the checks perform the transformation using ANTLR
syntax, embedded action code or a mixture (you might need to update
auxilliary structures such as the symbol table in addition to AST
changes).

&gt;<i> But my problem
</I>&gt;<i> is that I think that almost *all* the cases are like that, so I
</I>&gt;<i> have to embed *lots* of Java, and I'd have to end up doing what
</I>&gt;<i> it appears was done with that ASPA tool...separate out all that
</I>&gt;<i> Java from the grammar to keep my sanity. And that's kinda ugly
</I>&gt;<i> I think.
</I>
I don't think Anakreaon's reason for using the annotation tool was to
keep his sanity. Perhaps he just wanted the tree grammar specified in
one place. The structural differences between a C and a Java AST might
have precluded the use of the tool had he been working on a C-to-Java
translator.

&gt;<i> But don't you want the searching and the transformation to be
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;tightly coupled&quot;? For example, I have hundreds of straightforward
</I>&gt;<i> rules that can just be specified with simple text like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> int main(int v1, char *v2[]) --&gt; public static void main(String[] args)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So the &quot;matching pattern&quot; and the &quot;replacement pattern&quot; are only
</I>&gt;<i> separated by &quot;-&gt;&quot;. I'd hate to have rules where the &quot;matching&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> is specified in one place and the &quot;replacement&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> is in another. Even worse, the &quot;matching&quot; and &quot;replacement&quot; would
</I>&gt;<i> be in different languages. Not good.
</I>
ANTLR syntax can specify both matching and trasformation. As can Java.
Or even a custom DSL (as you have presumably implemented above). One
option saves more time than the others.

&gt;<i> &gt; Most production-level ANTLR grammars have a mix of ANTLR directives
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and action code. Incidentally, I don't recommend using a tool without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understanding it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You don't recommend using a library, for example, where you
</I>&gt;<i> understand the thing that it returns, but now how it works?
</I>&gt;<i> For example, you wouldn't use a JPEG encoder library that
</I>&gt;<i> produces a .jpg image without understanding JPEG or the
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm that it used?
</I>
Not without understanding what JPEG is and that the library is encode
JPEG. Also what input it requires and what the output would be. Then I
might try it on a few sample taks. I might really have been looking
for an MPEG encoding library after all  ;-)

&gt;<i> I say &quot;new JButton(&quot;hello&quot;);&quot; and use the JButton class without
</I>&gt;<i> any idea how it does its drawing. I really think it's ok
</I>&gt;<i> to use ANTLR to parse an C source into an AST without understanding
</I>&gt;<i> cgram.g and the ANTLR syntax that it follows. 
</I>&gt;<i> (That's not to say I don't).
</I>
Apples and oranges. Your JButton analogy is more like &quot;I can use ANTLR
without needing to fully understand the contents of Ter's PhD thesis.&quot;
You can use JButton with understanding Java. And import syntax and
semantics. Classpaths. Object construction.....

&gt;<i> &gt; Symbol tables are usually built for fast querying of node attributes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only and are often not updatable (there is no need since source files
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't change during compilation). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> AHA! Yes! And there you have it! The ASTs DO change during
</I>&gt;<i> translation, they change dramatically and often...that's
</I>&gt;<i> what translation is.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can make them updatable if your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applications need it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And wouldn't every translator have
</I>&gt;<i> a constantly changing symbol table?
</I>
Not neccessarily. A Pascal-to-Modula2 or GWBASIC-to-VB translator
might not need an updatable symbol table. I'm just guessing here mind you.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Comparing approaches by analyzing ease of change
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ===================================================
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Right, but the whole point of the tree grammar is to minimize
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the amount of code that you have to write. What's the point
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of embedding 30,000 lines of code inside a 350 line grammar,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; if you could have just written 30,020 lines that do the same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; thing?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A little exagerated no doubt. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How do you mean? I do have about 30,000 lines of translation
</I>&gt;<i> code, and the &quot;bare - do nothing&quot; C and java treewalker grammars
</I>&gt;<i> are several hundred lines. And it wouldn't take more than
</I>&gt;<i> 20 lines to do an inorder tree traversal.
</I>
It would take rather more if you preserved context info as the
tree-grammar approach does.

As for the 30,000 lines, I wonder how much of that would be generated
in an equivalent &quot;tree-grammar&quot; project.

&gt;<i> &gt; Most people are not using ANTLR to build their systems. If they were,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they'd [better] know ANTLR.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So most people won't want to use ANTLR to do AST matching
</I>&gt;<i> and transformations, even if they do use it (casually)
</I>&gt;<i> for lexing and parsing. i.e.
</I>
Don't know. I do know that most people aren't building langauge
processors explicitly and therefore have no need to use ANTLR or other
similar tools (including &quot;tree libraries&quot;).

&gt;<i> By analogy, Swing is inherently easier than SWT because it's
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;just Java&quot;, the developer doesn't have to learn a whole
</I>&gt;<i> new framework. 
</I>
To a Java developer, SWT is just Java too. Am I missing something or
are you saying Swing is easier because its from Sun and/or is included
in the standard java distributions.

&gt;<i> &gt; The empty expression?. Well, writing a rule to differentiate this case
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from the other seems easy enough - check for the EXPR's children.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it's easy enough in Java, just say:
</I>&gt;<i> AST expr = ast.getFirstChild();
</I>&gt;<i> if (expr == null) {
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ...but how do you do that using the treewalker grammar?
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe you can, but it's one more thing that someone's
</I>&gt;<i> got to learn that they wouldn't have to learn if they didn't
</I>&gt;<i> use a treewalker.
</I>
You weren't born with the ability and knowledge to write that Java
code snippet were you?  ;-)

&gt;<i> &gt; It can be a lot more than an AST traversal. It depends on what I put
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into my grammar. See my earlier comments.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can be, but is it typically a lot more for translators that
</I>&gt;<i> convert one high-level-language to another?
</I>
I'd suggest that depends on the langauges involved.

&gt;<i> &gt; Both the input and the output of a tree parser (tree-parser !=
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tree-walker) is an AST. It is an AST-to-AST transformer. In the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simplest case (the tree walker) it simply visits each node of the AST
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in depth-first order. The input and output ASTs are structurally the
</I>&gt;<i> same.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In more complex cases, the AST would be transformed and the input and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; output ASTs would be structurally different.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes I know. I'm just not getting my point across :(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How about this...let's say you're picking apples from a real
</I>&gt;<i> tree.
</I>
Oh come on!

&gt;<i> You put good apples into the basket and bad ones in
</I>&gt;<i> the garbage can. One way to pick the apples is with a tree
</I>&gt;<i> traversal...climb the trunk, go out on the first branch,
</I>&gt;<i> look at the first apple, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But is that the most natural way to pick the apples?
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe not. You could just shake the tree and then sort
</I>&gt;<i> out the apples after they've fallen.
</I>
Sorry, don't like my apples overly bruised  ;-)

&gt;<i> &gt; Not at all. I might be able to implement my system with the string
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hangling sheenanigans of sed/awk/perl etc. The problem isn't ever
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;lexing&quot; or &quot;parsing&quot;. It's building a source-to-source translator or,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; computing source code metrics etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Look, I said that lexers and parsers are candidates for
</I>&gt;<i> BNF-like specification because it's clear what the code is that
</I>&gt;<i> they should produce (it could be cryptic like lex/yacc or readable
</I>&gt;<i> like ANTLR, but the functionality of the generated code for
</I>&gt;<i> a lexer or parser is clear to all).
</I>
Clear to you. That is what you mean right. And by implication, tree
parsers aren't. I suggested you should learn more about them. Perhaps
do a simple source-to-source project to get a feel for them.

&lt;SNIP&gt;

&gt;<i> Show me a C token stream and I'll show you the AST that it
</I>&gt;<i> should produce. But show me a C AST and try to figure out
</I>&gt;<i> what the &quot;equivalent&quot; Java AST should be. Ask 100 people
</I>&gt;<i> and you'll get 100 different outputs.
</I>
Didn't we discuss an issue with the C AST structure for
ARRAY_DECLARATOR?. It would seem AST structure isn't universally
uniform after all.

&gt;<i> Yes, you don't need to use lexers and parsers, but that's
</I>&gt;<i> not the point. The point is that there's an inherent
</I>&gt;<i> difference between {lexers, parsers, compilers} and
</I>&gt;<i> {translators}.
</I>
Compilers are translators. Lexers, parsers and treeparsers are
components of translators.

&gt;<i> &gt; You might want consider separating analysis phases (that gather the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; info you need to make your synthesis decisions) from synthesis phases
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (that perform the actual transformations).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I've said, too late for that, I'm done already :)
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that when you've got hundreds of translation
</I>&gt;<i> rules, there's no point in doing an &quot;analysis phase&quot; ahead of time.
</I>&gt;<i> The analysis is (potentially) wrong after each rule firing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Say we have variable of type 'long'. I have lots of rules that
</I>&gt;<i> might change that type to an 'int', rename it, move the declaration,
</I>&gt;<i> delete it altogether, etc.
</I>
Nevertheless, translators are [almost] always written to operate in
such phases with synthesis following analysis.

&gt;<i> No, I can't use Java without understanding Java syntax :)
</I>&gt;<i> But I can use ANTLR to lex and parse
</I>&gt;<i> without understanding the grammar syntax.
</I>
Only because someone else has done all the work. Same as using a Java
library without having to write the code. What if there were no ready
made C grammar? Or if (like the C++ grammar) it doesn't have AST
building directives?

&gt;<i> &gt; I don't know of any open source example. Does Ter's multi-pass
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; translators and Monty's AREV Basic work count?.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe...anyone got a link for those?
</I>
The ANTLR site has some info on both project as does Monty's site.

&gt;<i> &gt; Even lint/splint etc?. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Compaq's ESC?. You *are* performing static
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; semantic analysis and using the result to informs decisions about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which AST transformations to perform.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hadn't looked at lint, assuming that it's not doing anything
</I>&gt;<i> radically different than javac (which I did look at).
</I>&gt;<i> I hadn't looked at splintor ESC. I'll take a look at them.
</I>&gt;<i> Keep in mind that these are just checking and not
</I>&gt;<i> translating.
</I>
Translating is checking followed by transforming followed by checking
then transforming then....

<PRE>I'd rather not touch the underlying grammar file as its not
mine. I'm using the java.g from the antlr's &quot;grammar&quot; webwape.
This way I would have to manually make modifications to any
updates that are made to it by Ter and other maintainers.

I actually had to merge IDENT from the java.g into the NUM_INT
rule and assign IDENT token type manually since there were a
number of conflicts with my extended data types such as IPv6
which uses hex digites and thus overlaps with IDENT on 'a'..'f'
alpha characters. I don't know of any way to do predicates on
seperate rules so I had to merge them. It works fine.

One thing I'm trying right now is simply make an empty IDENT
rule in my overriding Lexer &quot;protected&quot;:

protected IDENT: ;

Got rid of the warning but I'm getting strange errors in other
places now:

td  : &quot;header&quot;^ SEMI!
    ;

parser exception: a.npl:1:1: expecting &quot;header&quot;, found 'header'
a.npl:1:1: expecting &quot;header&quot;, found 'header'

If found what it was expecting and still threw an error. Doesn't
seem to be Lexer related, I must have messed up on options or
something like &quot;testLiterals=true&quot; or something although I think
that's a Lexer only option.

Cheers,
mark...

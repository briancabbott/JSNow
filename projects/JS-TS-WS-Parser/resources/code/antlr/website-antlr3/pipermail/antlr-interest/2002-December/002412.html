<PRE>Daniel,

&gt;<i> Overriding panic() is certainly a workaround, and indeed was the 
</I>&gt;<i> first thing I did after discovering the problem.  However, I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> really see that as the point.  The important thing is whether a 
</I>&gt;<i> library should handle fatal errors by shutting down the calling 
</I>&gt;<i> application without warning!
</I>
Not ideally but it works [ ;-) ], it's due for revision real soon 
anyways.

&gt;<i> A further problem with overriding panic() is that while you can do 
</I>&gt;<i> this for lexers, you cannot do it for parsers or tree parsers, 
</I>where 
&gt;<i> it is a static method.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, Micheal, just for curiosity I also built the C# codegen 
</I>&gt;<i> with Antlr 2.7.2a6.  I was able to do so quite easily, and my unit 
</I>&gt;<i> tests all passed without modification (unlike the upgrade from 
</I>&gt;<i> 2.7.2a2 to 2.7.2a4).
</I>
I did mention that it should be possible. There are a few problems 
with doing that (some of which you've already encountered but you can 
certainly do useful work with it).

Care to talk a little about these unit tests and the tools/harness 
you employ for them. About your ANTLR-related testing in general in 
fact.

&gt;<i> In fact, the discrepancies between the C# and 
</I>&gt;<i> the main Antlr branch are now quite few, which bodes well for 
</I>merging 
&gt;<i> the two streams.
</I>
I'm not sure I follow you here. What discrepancies are you referring 
to?

&gt;<i> What I wasn't able to get working in Antlr 2.7.2a6 was that third 
</I>&gt;<i> parameter that Terence added to the AST constructor syntax: #
</I>&gt;<i> [FOO, &quot;Foo&quot;, &quot;FooNode&quot;] (or something like that!)  I couldn't get 
</I>&gt;<i> that to work either with Java or C# (having ported Terence's 
</I>changes 
&gt;<i> to the C# action.g).  Antlr rejects the third parameter with a 
</I>syntax 
&gt;<i> error saying &quot;unexpected ','&quot;.  Is there something else one needs 
</I>to 
&gt;<i> do, to get Antlr to use the new action.g?
</I>
Quite a bit more. ANTLR/C# 2.7.2a6 would debut as soon as it's all 
done.

Cheers,

Micheal

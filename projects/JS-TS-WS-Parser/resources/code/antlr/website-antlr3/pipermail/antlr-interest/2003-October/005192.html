Megan,

The TokenStream interface itself has a single method - nextToken(). It
is called repeatedly until it returns an EOF token. Simple enough. The
implementation of nextToken() in generated lexers is non-virtual for
C++ &amp; C# (also for Java I think). Which suggests it isn't [really]
intended/expected to be overridden.

Now on to the issue you are having:

The implementation of nextToken() uses the method makeToken()
to...well...make the tokens. This is an extension point and you could
try overriding this method and plugging in custom code to make dummy
tokens here. Alternativey, you may prefer to use a separate
TokenStream object that is logically sited between your Lexer and
Parser - you can derived something from TokenStreamBasicFilter or
write your own.

So, you should either:
a. Override makeToken()
b. Implement a TokenStream filter

You may want to look at Monty's website <A HREF="http://www.codetransform.com/">http://www.codetransform.com/</A>
for ideas on building and using TokenStream filters.

Just out of interest, what are you using ANTLR/C# for?.

Cheers,

Micheal
ANTLR/C#



[*]  Incidentally, I should have asked you WHY you wanted to override
nextToken() before, rather than just suggesting a possible workaround
for the default non-virtual intent.

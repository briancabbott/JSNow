<PRE>This is certainly possible.  Of course this won't help much if your .c files
actually use the macros defined in the temp.h file.  But it's easy to write
a rule that parses the #include and then builds a whole copy of the
previously parsed tree.  

Another approach would be to recognize the #file directives and do something
smart like parse and checksum the whole section contributed by  &quot;temp.h&quot;
When lexing the next file first just read thru and checksum the section and
if it already exists just use it out of the cache (from the parser--just
pass a special token back from the lexer which represents the whole section
and which the parser will replace with the cached tree.)

Subject: [antlr-interest] caching AST and parsed information

Hi,

I am using antlr to instrument multiple (small) C-files automatically
with Monty's C-grammar.

Now I have the problem that all of my C-files include a file called
&quot;temp.h&quot; in which some macros are defined and which includes some
other project specific .h-files and some standard .h-files (eg.
stdio.h, math.h, ...). Because of the macros and typedefs in the
project-specific .h-files I am using a preprocessor before parsing
with antlr and I am getting very large files because of all the
includes, mainly the standard .h-files. Therefore parsing those files
is very slow.

Now my thoughts are: as all of my C-files only include this single
.h-file, I could possibly parse the temp.h file first and then cache
all the informations, antlr has parsed up to this point. After that I
could parse my c-files directly without using a preprocessor before
and ignoring the #include &quot;temp.h&quot;-directive.

How could I do that? Is this possible with antlr?

Thanks,
Daniel Raichle

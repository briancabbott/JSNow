<PRE>Hi,

I have to write a parser (in c++) for a language containing commands with options, however, the options are not reserved words and they can be used as identifiers in some other commands. The lexer is handwritten in c++. 

For instance, I have:

command:
 option1 = expression
|<i> option2 = expression
</I>|<i> option3 = expression
</I>
option1, option2, option3 are identifiers (i.e. they begin with letter and they continue with letters or digits) and they are not reserved words.

How can I do this in antlr? The workarounds that I was thinking of are:

1. Use semantic predicates:

option1 = expression1 becomes

{LT(1)-&gt;getText() == &quot;option1&quot;}? identifier &quot;=&quot; expression

downside: if the semantic predicate is not used as the first condition in an alternative then antlr sets the semanticexception message that gets thrown in case the predicate is false to the text between the curly brackets which I find unacceptable (is there a way to control the message?).

Example of code generated:
        match(TK_IDENTIFIER);
        if (!(LT(1)-&gt;getText() == &quot;OPTION1&quot;))
            throw antlr::SemanticException(&quot;LT(1)-&gt;getText() == \&quot;OPTION1\&quot;&quot;);

2. Treat option1, option2,, etc. as reserved words. Create a production:

id:
 identifier 
|<i> option1
</I>|<i> option2
</I>|<i> ...
</I>and use this wherever an identifier is supposed to be used.

Downside: every time I have to add another option that is not a reserved word I have to remember to add it here as well.

My question to you guys: is there another way to do this? 

I was almost thinking it would have been nice if antlr supported token subtypes. For instance I could have specified option1 with the form: identifier::option1 where identifier is the main token and option1 is the subtype and then have the match function support this kind of syntactic construction by matching the main token and its subtype. 

Thanks,
Costa

PS. Is there a way to search the mailing list archives? I couldn't find a search feature...

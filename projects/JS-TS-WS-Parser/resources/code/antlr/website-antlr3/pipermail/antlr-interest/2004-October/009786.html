I'm working on a &quot;blog&quot; entry that describes this right this second.  
Often concrete syntax level (rather than tree level) specs are easier.  
My only question will be, for the general case, is it powerful enough 
with a simple to understand &quot;engine&quot;.

Sounds like you and I should talk on the phone sometime when i get more 
time to think about a simple general rewrite system.  Where were you 
during the workshop!? ;)

Do you do multiple passes or all translations in a single?  What kind 
of &quot;engine&quot; did the replacing?

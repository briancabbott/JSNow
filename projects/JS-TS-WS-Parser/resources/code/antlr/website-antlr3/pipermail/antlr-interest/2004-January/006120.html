Hello to everyone!

It has been some time since my last post here!

For the impatient, here are the links:

Complete guide in PDF:
  <A HREF="http://www.lsi.us.es/~troyano/documentos/guia.pdf">http://www.lsi.us.es/~troyano/documentos/guia.pdf</A>

A zip with separated files for each chapter, in PDF:
  <A HREF="http://www.lsi.us.es/~troyano/documentos/guia-cap.zip">http://www.lsi.us.es/~troyano/documentos/guia-cap.zip</A>

Well, it is not &quot;a book&quot; but my &quot;end-of studies project&quot;; it is a
guide to ANTLR 2.7.2. It only considers java mode, and it is
completely written in spanish, so I don't know wether it will be of
use for many people of the list. It treats however some interesting
concepts like error treatment and compiler basics.

During the development of my project, I also developed an auxiliar
library, antlraux:
  <A HREF="http://antlraux.sourceforge.net">http://antlraux.sourceforge.net</A>

Both my (ex)university (University of Seville, Spain) and me own the
rights of the document, but it is free for educational purposes. I
finished it on september 2003, but it hasn't been published until
recently.

I included both links on the &quot;articles&quot; section of www.antlr.org;
unfortunately non-english chars seem to be not very well supported by
the site! Doh!

Well, have fun!

<PRE>Hi,
Thanks to the generous help from this list, I seem to have got over the worst of the learning curve for the Antlr C# target. I've also started to notice the logic in how the C# target deviates from the Java target, so I don't think I'll have to pester the list with stupid questions quite so much going forward. The C# target part of the learning curve has been for me much more difficult than the Antr learning curve itself, mostly because there is a lot of broken or out of date example code for the C# target floating around and it is hard to know where to look for useful examples that do work properly.
Anyhow, I've converted all the &quot;calculator&quot; examples from the first section of The Definitive Guide To Antlr to the CSharp3 target and they all seem to work. If there is interest and if I know how to do it, I would be happy to contribute them to the Antlr community. I'll probably continue to convert more examples as I work my way through the book.
I have to laugh, because for all I know there are up to date examples for all of these and I just don't know where they are!
I'd also be happy to contribute a few paragraphs on how the CSharp3 target grammar files and test harness differ from the Java target. These might be useful to newcomers such as myself since one generally loses &quot;the beginners perspective&quot; over time and thing become obvious that might not be obvious to beginners.

-          Andy

<PRE>Hi Grp,

I have the lexer, parser and an AST for a PASCAL-like grammar and I would
like to perform semantic analysis/symbol table checks/constant folding etc.
Is it a cumbersome task to write a tree walker for the abstract syntax tree
to perform these checks? When you perform semantic analysis on your input,
would you prefer to walk the tree or would you just embed it in your grammar
as actions?

Please let me know.

Bharath.

Yep.  This makes it handle nasty things like the C++ template vs &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; 
token problem simply disappear.  I.e., when lexing

List&lt;List&lt;int&gt;&gt; a;

you'll see that the nested template has &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; in it.  The lexer, without 
context, cannot know which to pick.  Only the parser knows that it 
expects &quot;&gt;&quot; followed by &quot;&gt;&quot; not &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; token. :)

The beauty of this is that the new lexer mechanism will deal with this 
easily.  Just create a new lexer rule for each parser context that is a 
set of alternatives.  The parser calls 
lexer.mySpecificContextTokenSet() rather than lexer.nextToken().  There 
are some issues such as ID vs literals and any other set of 
ambiguous/subset tokens, but I won't go into that at the moment.  
Whitespace can be tricky too.

This also seems to be a reasonable solution for keywords that can be 
variables.  When the parser must see it as a keyword, it asks for the 
keyword not an ID. :)

Woohoo!

This will be attacked after the core system is working as it is a 
direct extension and doesn't affect the underlying engine.

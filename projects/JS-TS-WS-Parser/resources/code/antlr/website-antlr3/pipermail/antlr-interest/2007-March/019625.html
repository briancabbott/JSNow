Your view isn't entirely right - while it is true, that ANTLR wants
lexer and parser rules distinguished through naming, naming isn't the
whole story. With my rule of thumb one knows when to use which naming
specification, and that isn't obvious even when having read the PDF, as
the BNF specifications I've come across never forced such a distinction.

Besides, if naming would be the only way to distinguish between parser
and lexer rules, how could ANTLR know when one uses the wrong naming
convention? I suppose that one could write a parser with doing the work
of the lexer so there would be no need to codify that convention in that
case. A simple &quot;Best Practice&quot; would be then sufficient.

Best regards,
Johannes Luber

<PRE>Howdy.  Yeah, I'm still thinking that BSD is the least restrictive and  
yet makes some lawyers feel better.

Thanks,
Ter

</I>&gt;<i> Here are a few:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 0) (I thought of this last but I'm adding it at the beginning because
</I>&gt;<i> it's so important to me!).  Those of us wanting to use Antlr within a
</I>&gt;<i> corporate environment have to do something to make the laywers happy.
</I>&gt;<i>  I think the singlemost important thing you can do here is to have a
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism for registering contributers.  Each contributer should be
</I>&gt;<i> reachable (email is fine but the more contact info you have the
</I>&gt;<i> better) and should have made some kind of affirmation that they agree
</I>&gt;<i> with the license (this affirmation could be an email that you print
</I>&gt;<i> and save, but a signed form faxed or snail-mailed would be even  
</I>&gt;<i> better).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest looking at some of the bigger open source projects like
</I>&gt;<i> Mozilla or Eclipse or Apache to see what mechanisms and forms they use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Laywers would be even happier if the contributers all assign their
</I>&gt;<i> copyrights to one person (i.e. Terence) or entity (like U of S.F.) but
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think this is necessary as long as all of the contributers are
</I>&gt;<i> contactable (and there aren't so many that it becomes extremely
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to contact them all).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Beyond that, you mentioned before that you are considering BSD as the
</I>&gt;<i> license.  That would work for me.  GPL or LGPL would totally disallow
</I>&gt;<i> me from using Antlr.  CPL (the license Eclipse uses) would be ideal
</I>&gt;<i> for me but BSD is very doable.

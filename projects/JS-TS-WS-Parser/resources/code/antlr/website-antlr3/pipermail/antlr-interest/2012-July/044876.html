<PRE>Usually, these pull requests are one offs so a click wrap license would be ideal. Those that continue to contribute,  could sign the full meal deal.

Hmm&#8230;yeah, maybe you're right. we need a page that covers all pull requests from a particular account. 

it would be nice to have a link or text in each committed pull request to show the certificate of origin. Any ideas there?

</I>&gt;<i> Howdy,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> people are now submitting nice pull request to the ANTLR project software,
</I>&gt;<i> but I have to keep the license clean. That's why I used to accept things
</I>&gt;<i> through the feedback page:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/misc/feedback">http://www.antlr.org/misc/feedback</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> or with the contributors license agreement. I submitted a feature request to
</I>&gt;<i> github to add such a license granting clause to the pull requests. they like
</I>&gt;<i> the idea, but I haven't heard back about implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What if we set up a webpage similar to the feedback page (current text
</I>&gt;<i> enclosed at the bottom) with a text box where people can submit a URL to a
</I>&gt;<i> pull request, certifying the origin of the material in that pull request.
</I>&gt;<i> The name/username/email etc. would have to match.very messy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a result of the certificate of origin, I could automatically post a
</I>&gt;<i> comment to the pull request so that it somehow links the certificate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does anybody have any process or legal advice?

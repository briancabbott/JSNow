<PRE>The funny thing is that Honey Badger DID support this kind of grammar 
(see my earlier mail with a running example). Maybe due to a bug, but 
that shows that it must be somehow possible in a top-down manner.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no way to exit that path.  So that way lies infinite recursion,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> madness, and/or Sparta.
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, looks like a perfectly fine grammar to me.
</I>&gt;<i> Not one a top-down parser would like, of course,

</I>&gt;<i> other than the normal ability of a grammar to produce
</I>&gt;<i> an infinite number of strings (it's not non-terminating).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Was this from a real usage attempt (if so, please explain more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what you were trying), or were you just experimenting?
</I>&gt;<i> Awk introduced implicit concatenation about 35
</I>&gt;<i> years ago. Not sure if there are any earlier examples of
</I>&gt;<i> the implicit binary operator.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a one-off case, but a well-established one.
</I>&gt;<i> A parser generator that truly supported expressions
</I>&gt;<i> in their &quot;natural&quot; language should not only allow
</I>&gt;<i> the implicit operator, but allow the user to specify
</I>&gt;<i> its precedence and associativity, IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is certainly doable bottom-up. One knows when an
</I>&gt;<i> expr has been seen and that the next token could start
</I>&gt;<i> an expr and can therefore &quot;pretend&quot; that the implicit
</I>&gt;<i> operator exists. Haven't thought about doing it top-down. I think
</I>&gt;<i> the harder problem is intelligent guidance so the user doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> make a mess. For example, it's problematic to try to add
</I>&gt;<i> this operator to C, and the parser generator has to know
</I>&gt;<i> quite a lot about expressions (apart from grammars) in order
</I>&gt;<i> to give an intelligent explanation of why that is (can't use
</I>&gt;<i> implicit binary if an outfix operator is overloaded to be a
</I>&gt;<i> postunary operator as well, as is the case in C with
</I>&gt;<i> '(X')' and 'X(X)').
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How does Awk do it then, since it also uses parens
</I>&gt;<i> for both grouping and function call? Unlike C, Awk
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't allow a function &quot;name&quot; to be an expression.
</I>&gt;<i> (Awk source code at google: The One True Awk).
</I>&gt;<i> More complications! (Although, complications like
</I>&gt;<i> that particular one get unified, I think, if you use LR(0)
</I>&gt;<i> and then only examine inadequate states to see what
</I>&gt;<i> problems are left over for precedence/associativity
</I>&gt;<i> to attempt to resolve).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is exactly why parser generators don't &quot;really&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> support expressions. To really go into that domain
</I>&gt;<i> requires embedding a lot of extra knowledge that's
</I>&gt;<i> pretty hard to get right, since it's not on a solid
</I>&gt;<i> mathematical foundation to start with. If you
</I>&gt;<i> don't try to jump in with both feet and handle
</I>&gt;<i> all the messes, then you only &quot;sorta&quot; support
</I>&gt;<i> expressions, like Yacc/Bison, and have to
</I>&gt;<i> (like them) leave a note mentioning that the user's
</I>&gt;<i> probably going to get into trouble if s/he strays outside
</I>&gt;<i> a few well-established usages.

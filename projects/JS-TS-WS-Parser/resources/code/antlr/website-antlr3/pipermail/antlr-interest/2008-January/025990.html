<PRE>Hello, Jim!

Thanks for your answer.

&gt;<i> Look at the example grammars for how to set up for parsing expressions
</I>&gt;<i> with precedence, you don't need those predicates but you do need to
</I>&gt;<i> chain your rules correctly.
</I>
My example was only a subset of the original grammar I am working on.   
Since that grammar is significantly larger (and works most of the time  
as expected) I would be glad if I didn't have to restructure it.

I'm particularly interested in why the parser fails to correctly parse  
the given input. If I step through the debugger of ANTLRWorks I can  
see that the parser not even tries to match the syntactic predicate.   
Why would it do so?

What's also strange: if I allow at most one expression as the function  
arguments, i.e.

function_call : IDENT '(' expression? ')' ;

everything works as expected.  Why?

&gt;<i> You are trying to construct context/semantics in the parser, but it's
</I>&gt;<i> job is to parse correct syntactical constructs only.
</I>
Is there a definite line between what's already context/semantics and  
what's still syntax?  Don't you define a language's syntax by  
specifying the context a given symbol or token is allowed to show up?

Christian

Yup.  That was my dissertation in a nutshell--finding the linear 
approximate lookahead and using it to reduce complexity even of full 
lookahead.  Your BDD may be applicable, but pretty hard to beat the 
simple k sets of tokens of linear approximate lookahead. ;)

It's really the computation...yes, storage is important to reduce as 
well, but I use that concept only because the worst case is obvious as 
O(n^k).  In reality, grammar analysis is a function of grammar size, 
vocabulary size, and k so it's even worse to compute than O(n^k).  You 
have to traverse O(n^k) paths at each decision point in the worst case 
even if you don't store the data ;)

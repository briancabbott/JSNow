<PRE>Echoing others, it all works perfectly for me L. Sorry you are having
problems. If you click the download arrow then you get the tgz (or at
least I do). I am using IE7, which for many people would mean it is
doomed to fail although IE7 works perfectly for me. Maybe try right
click and download target? Maybe it is your browser? Safari?

 

I think that the Cenqua guys would also like to know why it isn't
working for you as this is a commercial product, so provide them
feedback! J

Subject: [antlr-interest] Help with FishEye

 

Can someone please explain to me how FishEye is supposed to work?

 

I'm trying to download Jim Idle's latest C runtime from June 27th.

 

On <A HREF="http://fisheye2.cenqua.com/browse/antlr,">http://fisheye2.cenqua.com/browse/antlr,</A> I can see change revision
3851.

 

But if I click on the runtime/C/dist/libantlr3c-3.0.1.tar.gz URL
underneath the comment, I don't get a useful download.  I get 6K HTML
file.

 

If I click on the little blue down arrow, then I get a big file, but it
isn't actually a tar file.  I can't identify what it is.

 

I've been very frustrated with FishEye.  It's very...pretty.  But as far
as a mechanism for downloading files, it leaves me very frustrated.

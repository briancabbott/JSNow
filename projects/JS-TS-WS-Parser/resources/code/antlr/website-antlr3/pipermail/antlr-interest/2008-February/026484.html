Thanks John, I'm going to look into using the AST grammar you've provided. Hopefully it will be adequate enough even if it is still a work in progress. Please, when you update it could you send me a copy of the Grammar if that's at all possible.
 
@Peter Bulychev
Thanks for showing me the Same project, I am also going to look into the grammar they use and hopefully one of the two will do what I want. I honestly dont have the time and also the knowledge to create my own Java AST grammar at the moment. I believe I also share similar requirements to you except that my language will just be Java files (it's meant to also have PHP support but I have yet to find a PHP AST grammar, or even an up to date PHP grammar). Sharing advice etc would be quite good, but I cannot share the task because my project is for a 3rd year university dissertation and thus, has to be done sololy. I am allowed to use other peoples grammars though as the time frame I have to attempt this is so small that if I had to make everything myself I can't see it happening. The project itself seems to be much more complicated than I or my lecturer most likely anticipated, but I'm pretty sure general advice is allowed.
 
Thanks for the help so far guys, it is much appreciated.
Adam

This is still a work-in-progress, but you're welcome to what I have. 

Please let me know if you run into any problems with this, as I'm trying to make it work nicely.

Peace
- John

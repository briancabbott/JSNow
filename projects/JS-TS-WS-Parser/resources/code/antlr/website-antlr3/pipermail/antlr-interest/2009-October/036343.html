<PRE>The other say I replied from my ipod and was not able to test it with ANTLR.
I checked it now and the code doesn't work for me too. However you can try a
variant:

 

q             :               a ((b)=&gt;NOWAY | /*nothing*/)

                ;

 

fragment NOWAY

                :               ;

 

This is tested J But note that this is only a hack and use it only when
there is no other alternative. 

 

Going by your &quot;one of my &quot;smaller&quot; rules is &quot;consuming&quot; something that
should belong to a &quot;larger&quot; rule&quot; description, it looks like you can solve
that problem by turning off greedy. Grep for 'greedy' in the book or wiki.

 

Cheers, Indhu

Jim, being new to predicates I realised soon after this that you were
talking about token lookaheads. And yes I do need a syntactic lookahead (but
thas is negative). In beginner-speak, one of my &quot;smaller&quot; rules is
&quot;consuming&quot; something that should belong to a &quot;larger&quot; rule. This would be
correct if that particular something (e.g. &quot;a&quot;) was *not* followed by a
syntactic construct conforming to &quot;b&quot;. Hence (a !b)=&gt;a (for the smaller
rule) seems the simplest solution to this to me. Is Indhu's version correct
for doing this trick? It doesn't seem to work for me (but I might be doing
something else wrong). If not correct, what is the correct way? My target is
Java.

Use a semantic predicate rather than syntactic. You possibly need a bated
predicate here too:

 

{ input.LA(1) == A &amp;&amp; input.LA(2) != B}?=&gt;

 

However, if you need that kind of syntactic predicate, then I suggest you
may be approaching your problem incorrectly.

If I do

 

(a ~b)=&gt; a

 

meaning &quot;take this alternative if you encounter an a when not followed by b&quot;

 

I get a syntax error: unexpected token b

Is it the right syntax to use '~'?

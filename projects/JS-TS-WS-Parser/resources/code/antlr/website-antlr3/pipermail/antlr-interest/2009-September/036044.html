<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Is this your own language?
</I>Yes, it's a little toy language I'm working on for educational purposes 
and fun of course.
&gt;<i> Note that in C, C++, Java, C#, and other
</I>&gt;<i> languages with C-derived syntax, &quot;int a, b = 3&quot; would not assign anything
</I>&gt;<i> to a; it would leave a uninitialized. It's liable to confuse programmers
</I>&gt;<i> of these languages if your language has C-like syntax but differs on this
</I>&gt;<i> point. [*]
</I>&gt;<i> I also think you may be trying too hard to collapse semantic equivalences
</I>&gt;<i> while generating the AST. A declaration initialiser is a different
</I>&gt;<i> construct from an assignment. It might (in some language) be equivalent
</I>&gt;<i> to an uninitialised declaration followed by an assignment, but an AST is
</I>&gt;<i> still an abstract *syntax* tree -- it should preserve syntactic distinctions
</I>&gt;<i> such as that between &quot;int a; a = 3;&quot; and &quot;int a = 3;&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i> (Whether to distinguish between &quot;int a, b;&quot; and &quot;int a; int b;&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> slightly less obvious, but my personal preference would be to preserve
</I>&gt;<i> that distinction in the AST as well.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Those a very good points. I will certainly consider them but first I 
have to get some code generated, I have already
defined much more grammar than intended. I guess that's what one gets 
for antlr being such an awesome tool that makes
defining languages so much fun :)

Thank you very much for your feedback, it's much appreciated.

Stefan

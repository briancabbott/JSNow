 &gt;However, after I generated parser code, even the simplest

 &gt;the &quot;Clean and rebuild all if anything is strange&quot; mantra. I
 &gt;generated all code again, including the tree walker. Note

 &gt;What happened there? Why did an internal change in parser rules
 &gt;(even lexer rules should not have been affected) render the
 &gt;genereated tree walker code useless?

Are you sure you didn't change any of the lexer rules?  (And 
remember that if you're using a combined grammar, using a string 
literal in the parser counts as changing the lexer 
rules!)  Reordering the rules without actually changing them will 
have a similar effect (and again, if you've used quoted literals 
then that includes parser rules).

In any event, it sounds like the token definitions changed, so the 
tree parser was working on outdated values.  You need to inform 
your build environment that the YourGrammar.tokens file is an 
input dependency of YourTreeGrammar.g in order to make it realise 
it needs to rebuild the tree grammar in such cases.  (Exactly how 
you do that depends on your platform, language, and build tools of 
choice.)

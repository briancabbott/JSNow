That's what FAQs are for :)  (You're going to get this sort of 
question either way -- and &quot;how do I make it faster&quot; is an easier 
question to answer than &quot;why does this mysteriously fail on 
certain input&quot;.)

Possibly though we're just coming at this from different 
perspectives.  Performance has never really been a big issue for 
me, as most of the ANTLR grammars I've created have been used 
either in hobby projects where I didn't really care about the time 
required (even though these probably ended up having the largest 
amount of input pumped through them at a time) or as DSL compilers 
for professional projects where the overall non-ANTLR compile-time 
was in the minutes anyway so a few more seconds here or there 
didn't really make much difference.

Getting the grammars robust, though, was at times quite 
un-obvious, especially when I was first starting out.

 &gt;#define ANTLR3_SANITY_CHECK
 &gt;
 &gt;But otherwise that would do it assuming that I wanted to add 
lots
 &gt;of #ifdefs. It is however easy to extend the debug option,
 &gt;assuming that Ter believes the idea is a worthwhile one.

I still think the default should be to sanity check.  (Similar to 
how most people work on their projects in &quot;debug mode&quot; and only 
switch to &quot;release mode&quot; for final testing and release.)  And this 
is quite a different idea than ANTLR's current debug mode.

You also wouldn't need all that many #ifdefs -- just one or two at 
the top of the file where you create a bunch of macros that either 
compile to sanity-checking code or to nothing.  It's a pity you 
can't rely on being compiled with gcc, though, since that compiler 
has extensions that make doing this sort of thing much easier :)

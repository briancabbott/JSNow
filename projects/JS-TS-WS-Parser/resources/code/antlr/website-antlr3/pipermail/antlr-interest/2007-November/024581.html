<PRE>I am trying to create what should be the simplest grammar possible (with 
EOF) that provides full error reporting, since a grammar without full 
error reporting is worthless. I have solved some undocumented 
peculiarities, but I do not know if I have done so in a manner 
consistent with the intended design of AntLR. I describe 3 problems 
below, the first two with possible solutions and the third still unsolved.

What I need to know is:
   1 Are the solutions I used for problems 1 and 2 consistent with the 
intended design of AntLR, or are there better ways?
   2 How do I deal with problem 3?

The grammar is:
----------
grammar SingleCharacter;

@header {
import static java.lang.System.out;
}


/* Parser Rules */
singleCharacter
returns [boolean succeeded = false]
     :   Character {
             out.println(
                 &quot;Parsed token Character '&quot; + $Character.text + &quot;'&quot;
             );
         }
         EOF {
             out.println(&quot;Parsed token EOF&quot;);
         }
         {
             out.println(&quot;Parsed singleCharacter&quot;);
             $succeeded = true;
         }
     ;

/* Lexer Rules */
Character: 'a';
// Invalid added for problem #2
Invalid  :  .  {$type = Token.INVALID_TOKEN_TYPE;};

----------
Problem #1

There is a serious bug in the lexer that causes it, during error 
recovery, to skip two characters instead of just the unexpected 
character. When a character is not matched, match() creates an exception 
object 'mte', calls recover(mte) which consumes the unexpected 
character, and then throws the exception. However, nextToken() catches 
that exception, reports the error, and then calls recover(mte) again, 
erroneously consuming the token after the already consumed unexpected token.

In my simple example, the source &quot;ba&quot; produces the following results:
Note: The Invalid token did not exist at this point.
&lt;&lt;
Parsing: &quot;ba&quot;
Token stream
     &lt;No tokens&gt;

Parser output
line 1:0 mismatched character 'b' expecting 'a'
BR.recoverFromMismatchedToken
line 0:-1 mismatched input '&lt;EOF&gt;' expecting Character

Returned false
 &gt;&gt;

The lexer does not provide any tokens to the token stream.
This is what actually happens in the lexer:
   1 A call to match('a') is is made by mCharacter()
   2 The first character seen is an invalid 'b'
   2 A MismatchedTokenException object is created
   4 The recover(mte) method is called that consumes the current invalid 
character 'b'
   4 The exception object is thrown
   5 The exception is caught by nextToken()
   6 A call to reportError(re) is made that displays the lexer error
   7 Another call to recover(re) is made that consumes the next 
character, the valid character 'a'
   8 nextToken() loops back to try to get a token again, sees EOF, and 
returns Token.EOF_TOKEN
   9 The parser has no tokens in the stream and reports it saw &lt;EOF&gt;

Given the flow of the code and the use of nextToken(), it seems the 
solution is to eliminate the call to recover(re) in the exception 
handler of nextToken(). It works fine for my simple example, but I'm not 
sure if this is consistent with the intended design of AntLR.

----------
Problem #2

I originally did not have the &quot;Invalid&quot; token. I quickly discovered that 
CommonTokenStream parses *ALL* of the tokens in the source on the first 
call for a token. I had expected that it would only buffer the consumed 
and look-ahead tokens so that any lexer exception would be caught by the 
parser and could be reported in parser context. I do not understand and 
it is undocumented for what purpose CommonTokenStream does this.

I also found that the lexer is not capable of propagating a 
RecognitionException since nextToken has a catch hard-coded in. There 
seems to be no way in the grammar to configure this outside of 
overriding the nextToken() method.

The idea is to use AntLR &quot;as is&quot; as much as possible, so implementing a 
new TokenStream that only buffers consumed or look-ahead tokens is out. 
It seems that the only solution is to record lexer errors in the token 
stream as &lt;invalid&gt; tokens. This could be done by defining &lt;invalid&gt; 
tokens in the grammar with a type assigning action, or overriding the 
nextToken() method and altering the exception handler.

Both of these solutions work for my simple example. Also, since they 
both eliminate the possibility of a RecognitionException being thrown, 
they mask problem #1.

I chose the grammar solution for this example, but it might not be 
possible for a more complex lexer, and I do not know if this is a 
solution that is consistent with the intended design.

----------
Problem #3

For this problem, I do not have a solution, and it is a show-stopper.

The parser, when it sees an unexpected token, reports the error and 
tries two kinds of recovery. If the following token is of the expected 
type, it consumes the current token and returns a match, skipping the 
unexpected token. If the current token can follow the expected token, it 
returns a match and does not consume a token, continuing with the 
current token as if it had seen the missing token.

This means that match() might match the next or a non-existing token 
instead of the current. However, when a rule action uses a token 
reference, like in my grammar where the action in singleCharacter that 
follows Character uses the $Character.text field to report the string 
that was matched, that reference is obtained by AntLR before the call to 
match() from the input stream like so:
     Character1=(Token)input.LT(1);
     match(input,Character,FOLLOW_Character_in_singleCharacter33);
     out.println(&quot;Parsed token Character '&quot; + Character1.getText() + &quot;'&quot;);

If the call to match() performs error recovery, that token reference 
will *NOT* be the one that matched. The matched token might be the next 
token if the current one was skipped, or might be no token if the 
current one was a valid follow token.

Since the code that gets the reference is automatically generated by 
AntLR, and since match() does not record or return the matched token, I 
see no way to tell AntLR to handle this correctly.

In my simple example, if the source text is &quot;ba&quot;, I get the following 
result:

&lt;&lt;
Parsing: &quot;ba&quot;
Token stream
     0; channel[0] &lt;invalid&gt;, &quot;b&quot; at 1:0
     1; channel[0] Character, &quot;a&quot; at 1:1

Parser output
BR.recoverFromMismatchedToken
line 1:0 mismatched input 'b' expecting Character
Parsed token Character 'b'
Parsed token EOF
Parsed singleCharacter

Returned true
 &gt;&gt;

The problem is demonstrated by the first action output:
   1 The &lt;invalid&gt; 'b' token is parsed
   2 Error recovery is performed that skips the current token since the 
next is the expected Character 'a'
   3 The Character match() returns successfully
   4 The Character action prints the result

However, the $Character reference is still the skipped &lt;invalid&gt; 'b' 
token instead of the now current Character 'a' token. So the message 
says it &quot;Parsed token Character 'b'&quot; instead of &quot;Parsed token Character 
'a'&quot;.

As this problem creates incorrect data within the action, it is data 
corruption and a show-stopper in any environment. Is there a way to deal 
with this in AntLR, or is this an unresolved bug?

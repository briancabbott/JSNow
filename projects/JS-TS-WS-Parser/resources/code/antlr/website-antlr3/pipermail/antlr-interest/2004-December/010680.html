Well yes, there was no rule to match the character, not until I added
a dummy one anyway. But it was still my understanding that when I use
.*, or in my case:

        (
            options {
                greedy=false;
            }
        :   .
        )*
 
charVocabulary would be used. Useful when you're matching strings for
example. In my case I want to discard that which is matched by the .*,
but what if I wanted to keep it?

&gt;<i> &gt; The error goes away, but then it stops on some other char. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; continues until I've added all the chars not listed in some rule in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the lexer. So to be sure it seems I will have to explicitly list *all*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the ASCII characters.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, yeah.  If you want it to ignore stuff you don't have rules for,
</I>&gt;<i> just set filter=true. :)
</I>
What I'm trying to achieve is to match a function prototype but ignore
it's body. Functions are declared using FUNCTION .. END_FUNCTION
pairs, so I use the above non-greedy (.)* construct to match the body.
But filter seems to work and is probably a much better idea, thanks
for the tip!

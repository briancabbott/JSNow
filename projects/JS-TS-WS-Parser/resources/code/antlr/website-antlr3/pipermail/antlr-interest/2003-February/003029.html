<PRE>Hi,

You can send big stuff directly to me if necessary, our mailserver can
handle quite a lot.

I'll look at it when I'm back in office. (Taking a few earned days off
after returning from business trip to the states)

&gt;<i>             - Preprocessor Definitions
</I>&gt;<i>               - WIN32;_DEBUG;_WINDOWS;_USRDLL;ANTLR_EXPORTS;ANTLR_CXX_SUPPORTS_NAMESPACE
</I>
Shouldn't that namespace macro be in the config.hpp, in an appropriate msvc
7 #ifdef ?

&gt;<i>       - Check files (e.g. with the WinDiff) for details and other changes.
</I>
Will do :)

&gt;<i> 2 Requests by Alexander Lenski
</I>&gt;<i>         These changes make specialization of the buffers possible.
</I>
I'll look at them, don't see much problems there. I might change a name or
two if I think it's more in antlr's naming style though.

&gt;<i>       - About the ! suffix (currently not implemented in full) for AST
</I>&gt;<i>         construction rules
</I>&gt;<i>         - Please, clarify your intentions related to the !.
</I>
What's documented should work I guess. If it's not it's a bug. The last
month has been very busy for me so I might have missed a bug report in that
period. To speed up bug fixes in C++ codegen you can send me a complete
compilable grammar which demonstrates the problem (if it's non trivial to
see) If I have to make a grammar myself to find debug such stuff it will
usually take quite some time to get it fixed (since it will need a big
antlr session for me to work on).

&gt;<i> - Please, consider addition of one more option for the C++ code gen to set
</I>&gt;<i>   DLL export/import customizable spec in all antlr-generated classes in the
</I>&gt;<i>   form class CUST_API SomeClass... 
</I>
You mean an addition to only the top of the class definitions ? Mail me
details of what you want and I'll have a look (doesn't sound hard to make
in any case).

Thanks for your work!!!

Cheers,

Ric

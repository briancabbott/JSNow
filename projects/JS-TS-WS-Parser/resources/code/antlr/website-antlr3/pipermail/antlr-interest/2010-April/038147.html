Actually, I think that if you use UnbufferedTokenStream(), that this will pretty much do what you want already, but it is easy to derive from one of the token streams, and add methods tah can discard buffered tokens once you know you have dealt with them.

Also, if you have comma separated files, then it is usually easier to use awk. Finally, your grammar has myriad lexical ambiguities and I am afraid it is not going to work as you have written it. You cannot have more than one lexer rule that matches the same text as the lexer is not syntax directed, it just tokenizes what it sees.

</I>&gt;<i> You can easily implement your own TokenStream that is optimized for

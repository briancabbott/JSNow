<PRE>The 1.5.6 release fixed the threading issues that had plagued the other 1.5
releases. I see no need to support 1.4, especially if it is something
planned for a release six months from now. I only run Linux (FC4) and
Windows (2k and XP) so I can't speak for those running Solaris, etc. Is it
common to have a program that runs in 1.4 that doesn't run in 1.5? I haven't
seen any but I mostly just work with Eclipse-based stuff.

&gt;<i>I don't know for sure but wouldn't that cause a backwards compatibility
</I>problem if people need to use a Java 1.4 compiler. Otherwise I completely
agree.

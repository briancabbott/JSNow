<PRE>Thanks. I'll have to play. I suspect it'll be harder than it looks,
though, thanks to the position of my parentheses :-)

Cheers,
Wol

In the parser you should be able to do something like:

parser_rule: 
	t1:TOKEN1 { t1.setText(&quot;sometext&quot;); t1.setType(MY_TYPE); }
	t2:TOKEN2 ;	

'Problems' may of course arise if the tree is built before you change
the
attributes, which may lead to confusion... So you may have to patch the
generated tree as well (or play a bit with the action code position and
check the generated code to see if it does the right thing)

Cheers,

Ric

 Why don't we just invite them to dinner and massacre them all when
they're
  drunk? You heard the man. There's seven hundred thousand of them. Ah?

           So it'd have to be something simple with pasta, then.

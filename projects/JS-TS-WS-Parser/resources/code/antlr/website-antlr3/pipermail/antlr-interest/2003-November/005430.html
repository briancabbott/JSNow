<PRE>Hi, this is Chris Leung, author of LLK. I am just one of
many to write open source software to kill time (somebody may
mistaken that as xxx ms).

Thanks for all the interest in LLK.  LLK is started as I explore
several design alternatives while I study ANTLR. It turns out
to have some worthwhile features and improvements.  So I released
the code and hope that would be useful for others.  I would be
most glad if anything in LLK would be useful for ANTLR.

To be honest, I am no expert in this field. LLK is started as a hack
of ANTLR. The basic algorithm is same as ANTLR.  But as more and more
feature and implementation differences comes in, it is almost
a complete rewrite. Most of the differences from ANTLR are explained
in the LLK documentation at llk.sourceforge.net.

I ran some preliminary test (with GnuCParser) and found that it (LLK
v0.1) is about 4-5 times faster than ANTLR 2.7.2 (in Java). But I 
have not dig too deep into it yet. I would certainly be glad to 
discuss any specific issues about LLK.

Thanks,
Chris.

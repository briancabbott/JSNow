<PRE>Ric,

&gt;<i> &gt; Do people think I should force the grammar name (including 
</I>&gt;<i> case) to be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same as filename (with .g suffix)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Dunno. I don't like the force thingy ;) Including case might 
</I>&gt;<i> give problem on filesystems not supporting (or faking) case 
</I>&gt;<i> sensitivity. Maybe a case if it's not broken don't fix it?
</I>
Perhaps it was &quot;broken&quot; and we just got used to it?  ;-)

Anyhooo, it was part of the reason I stopped the VS.NET [codegen]
integration for ANTLR way back when. The multiple [possibly unrelated]
language processors from one grammar file issue was another. VS.NET just
couldn't handle that with any of it's straightforward-integration options.

I like the flexibility even though I most often use a
one-langauge-processor-per-file scheme. Perhaps we could consider providing
a tiny support library that can be used to determine the output files for a
given grammar file. This library would be distinct from the runtime library.
It is really meant to be used by/with build tools and could be available in
Java, C (or perhaps C++) and C# to cover most build platforms.

I don't much like Java's inflexible naming scheme but, I'd like to see a
Nant/MSBuild task too.

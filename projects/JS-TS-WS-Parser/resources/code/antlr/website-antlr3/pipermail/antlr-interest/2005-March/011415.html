I thonk not. Try using syntactic predicate instead of semantic one. You 
wrote that it's impossible in your case, but IMHO it is. Just notice, that 
every closing brace is matched be an openig one -- so make ANTLR decide 
upon that.

So... In your original grammar instead of...


expressionList : '{' expr ( ';' expr )* '}' ;


Try using...


expressionList: '{' exprListBody '}'

exprListBody:
  ('{')=&gt; expressionList exprListBody
 | expr (';' exprListBody)?
 | (';')*
 ;


&gt;<i> Perhaps ANTLR 3 will support the hoisting I need.
</I>
Try the above proposal -- or something about the lines (I didn't check if 
it's 100% right, but I had to somewhat do similar stuff in my grammar (my 
case is more complex, as using separator is dictated not only by preceding 
construct but also the following one -- in your case it would be something 
like making semicolon optional not only directly after closing brace, but 
also directly before opening brace -- this is also possible to solve

<PRE>Alright, I give up :(.  What is the secret to Antlr, jk.  I am still 
having some trouble getting started with Antlr, and I believe most of my 
confusion comes from how strings/tokens/vocab is done.

I was reading the java.g grammar and was wonding, in the parser there is 
the rule

builtInType
        :       &quot;void&quot;
        |       &quot;boolean&quot;
        |       &quot;byte&quot;
        ..
        ;

Then in the Lexer there is

IDENT
options { testLiterals=true; }
        : ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'|'_'|'$')('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'|'_'|'0'..'9'|'$')*
        ;

NUM_INT
{boolean isDecimal=false; Token t=null;}
        :       '.' {_ttype=DOT;}
                (       ('0'..'9')+ (EXPONENT)? (f1:FLOAT_SUFFIX {t=f1;})?
                        {
                                ......

protected 
FLOAT_SUFFIX
        :       'f'|'F'|'d'|'D'
        ;


When the parser says, give me next token (nextToken), the Lexer will eat 
the next token based on the Lexer rules.  Now if the string &quot;void&quot; comes 
in, the Lexer says, let me check if there is a literal yet for this token. 
 However I do not see what is going on here.  The word &quot;void&quot; in the 
parser may not have been seen yet (calling builtinType).  I have read teh 
vocab document, but still don't think I understand.  I have tried using 
tokens {} and don't understand why that works.  Could someone explain 
these simple concepts?  I know I am missing something very simple here.  I 
can follow along the grammars just fine, but I don't understand real 
workings on these issues, espically how or where you check Identifiers vs. 
Keywords (I have read a dozen things, and none of them seem to explain it 
in a way I can follow).

Also does protected mean that the Lexer will never call FLOAT_SUFFIX 
directly,if it is trying to get the nextToken, it will only try to get it 
from the FLOAT_SUFFIX call in NUM_INT.  Correct?  Is this to keep similiar 
issues like (IDENT vs Keywords) from happening?

Thanks Ron

ps.  When I get this all figured out, I will write another tutorial 
hopefully documenting the same issues I have, maybe help someone one day

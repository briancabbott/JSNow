&gt;<i> Why do you consider these cases:
</I>
&gt;<i> (XYZ)*[0,n] means 0..n occurrences.  (XYZ)*[n,m] means 0, or n..m
</I>&gt;<i> occurrences.  (XYZ)*[n] means 0 or exactly n occurrences.
</I>
&gt;<i> not justifiable to include?
</I>
(A) Thanks for asking!

(B) To be clear, please note that I wrote that I wasn't sure whether they
are justifiable or not.  That's a good bit different from your restatement.

(C) Basically, it's easy to argue that they aren't used much and that they
are so close to the + variety that people would get weird behavior that
they wouldn't understand.  It's also arguable that the zero versus some
number of instances test should be done in a semantic pass against e.g.,
the AST rather than in the parser.

(D) As I mentioned, I think they are actually useful; would be
consistent and coherent with the * vs. + separation that we already have
now; and should be in lexers, parsers, and tree walkers.

Hope this makes sense,
			John

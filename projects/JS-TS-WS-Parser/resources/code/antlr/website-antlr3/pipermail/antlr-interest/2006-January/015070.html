</I>&gt;<i> Hi Andy,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few holes to poke in your article.  Which I mean in the nicest 
</I>&gt;<i> possible way!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From your paper:  &quot;But the main rationale for separating the &quot;view&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> from the &quot;controller&quot; and &quot;model&quot; is so that we can have multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;views&quot;, and that we can easily change the &quot;view&quot; without having to 
</I>&gt;<i> touch the &quot;model&quot; or the &quot;controller. Certain applications may have 
</I>&gt;<i> multiple &quot;views&quot; (ANTLR, for example, which takes a single input in 
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR-language, but generates Java code for Java programmers, C code 
</I>&gt;<i> for C programmers, etc). But for other applications, such as a 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Any-dialect-of-C to Java&quot; or &quot;C or C++ to Java&quot;, the mapping is 
</I>&gt;<i> many-to-one, not one-to-many.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Isn't this a false dichotomy?  The same considerations apply to both 
</I>&gt;<i> situations.  If antlr can do many-to-one (source grammar to a variety 
</I>&gt;<i> of target languages) 
</I>
You mean &quot;one-to-many&quot;, here, not &quot;many-to-one&quot;, don't you? ANTLR itself 
has just one input language, and &quot;many&quot; output languages (C++, Java, C#).

&gt;<i> that is only because somebody took the trouble to write the target 
</I>&gt;<i> generation code.  It's not one-to-many, but many one-to-ones.  This is 
</I>&gt;<i> exactly what happens with a many-to-one mapping (variety of source 
</I>&gt;<i> languages to one target language): for each source language somebody 
</I>&gt;<i> has to take the trouble to write the transformation code, and you 
</I>&gt;<i> again end up with many one-to-ones.
</I>
No, I don't think that ANTLR is many one-to-ones at all. There is only 
one input language, there is a lot of code to derive the output, and then
there are minor variations on the output to make it fit either C++, 
Java, or C# syntax.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if it is a problem for Antlr, it is the same problem for Jazillion 
</I>&gt;<i> or any other code xformer, regardless of implementation technique.
</I>
I do agree that (and I'm not sure if this is your point or not) ANTLR 
and Jazillian seem like they should both be designed the same way.
That's why I wrote this - to try to understand why my &quot;rule-based&quot; way 
seems better to me, and yet the &quot;treewalker&quot; way seems better
to Terence and a lot of people in the translation world. I assume it's 
something I'm missing, but who knows?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually I think &quot;MVC&quot; is probably not the best idiom for discussion 
</I>&gt;<i> parsing and transformation, coming as it does from the world of 
</I>&gt;<i> graphical representation of data.  (Personally I don't find it useful 
</I>&gt;<i> to think of the result of a translation as a &quot;view&quot; of the source; 
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. calling the parser code generated by Antlr a &quot;view&quot; of the source 
</I>&gt;<i> grammar doesn't work for me.  
</I>
Me neither, I hope I didn't say that.

&gt;<i> Nobody considers the machine code emitted by a compiler to be a &quot;view&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> of the source code.)
</I>
Ah, but they do. I do, and  that's exactly what Terence is saying in the 
StringTemplate article...that the target Java, python, and bytecode
are simple three slightly different &quot;views&quot; of the output. I agree with 
that.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The real question is not separation of m v and c, but of the 
</I>&gt;<i> *genericity* (adaptability, flexibility, whatever) of the &quot;service&quot;: 
</I>&gt;<i> given a parser generator, is its backend architecture general enough 
</I>&gt;<i> to make it easy to write specialized emitters?  Given a language 
</I>&gt;<i> transformer (e.g. Jazillion), is its frontend architecture general 
</I>&gt;<i> enough to make it easy to specialize it for a variety of input languages?
</I>
In my case, I haven't cared too much (yet) that the frontend by able to 
handle multiple input languages (or that the backend be able
to output multiple languages for that matter). Just a single C-to-Java 
translator is hard enough, and I've been happy to spend 3 years full time
thinking about all the ways to do that really well, rather than 
expanding my scope. Having said that, I'm now working on C++ to Java, 
though :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More specifically:  how hard would it be to write an ML or Haskell 
</I>&gt;<i> emitter for Antlr (something I'd like to see)?
</I>
Good question, and my related question is &quot;will StringTemplate make that 
any easier?&quot;.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How hard would it be to write an ML or Haskell front-end for 
</I>&gt;<i> Jazillion?  (I mean relative to a C frontend, not relative to a 
</I>&gt;<i> backend to Antlr, which would no doubt be easier.)
</I>
Answer: very hard: the translation rules are all C-specific. To put it 
bluntly, the Jazillian &quot;front-end&quot; is not in any way separated from the 
&quot;engine&quot;
and &quot;backend&quot;. I believe it's impossible to design such a 
any-language-to-any-language translation engine, despite the fact that
Semantic Designs claims to have such a product.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Note GCC is a good example of genericity both on the front and back 
</I>&gt;<i> ends.)
</I>
Right, I'm familiar with the gcc 4.0 architecture. IIRC it only supports 
C/C++ with gcc-specific extensions and Java as input,
and executable and Java bytecode as output. Good luck on getting it to 
input or output ML, Haskell, or Lisp :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A general observation:  you contrast the Antlr (AST) approach to 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;pattern-matching&quot; in a few places (e.g. &quot;is what you've got using 
</I>&gt;<i> StringTemplates and AST walking better than what you'd have with some 
</I>&gt;<i> (unspecified here) pattern-matching approach?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But parsing *is* pattern matching, no?  So it isn't clear (to me) what 
</I>&gt;<i> exact contrast you're trying to establish.
</I>
I'm not refering to ANTLR parsing here, but ANTLR treewalking. But yes, 
we could consider treewalking to be &quot;pattern-matching on
two-dimensional trees&quot;, while I'm saying I prefer &quot;pattern-matching on 
one-dimensional token streams&quot;. Simply because it's trivial to
form mental pictures of token streams. When we read &quot;int[] i;&quot;, our 
brain has already tokenized it into a sequence of 5 tokens:
int [ ] i ;
But given that same chunk of code, our brains to NOT easily form an AST 
structure:
VAR_DEC
     TYPE &quot;int&quot;
     ARRAY_DEC  &quot;[]&quot;
     NAME &quot;i&quot;

Avoiding mental pictures of AST trees altogether is just a HUGE 
productivity boost, at least for me.
I'd say I'm at least twice as productive in writing rules (both simple 
text-replacement ones and
complex ones written in Java code), and probably more like 5-10x more 
productive
by largely ignoring AST structures.
    

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the examples you give to illustrate the difficulty of AST-walking:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     2.  At any &quot;printf function&quot; node, loop through the format string 
</I>&gt;<i> and arguments, and do lots of processing to replace them with Java 
</I>&gt;<i> using the &quot;+&quot; operator.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My understanding is that you would just write a production for the 
</I>&gt;<i> grammar of the args of the printf function, which you could take 
</I>&gt;<i> directly from the C grammar, augmented by info from the printf 
</I>&gt;<i> definition in the library.  The &quot;lots of processing&quot; must occur 
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of implementation strategy, but in Antlr the grammar 
</I>&gt;<i> recognition part (looping through the format string and args) is clear 
</I>&gt;<i> and simple(?).
</I>
That's right, except I disagree about the &quot;clear and simple&quot;. It's not 
all that hard, but it's also not trivial. I prefer to just use plain old 
Java.
To parse arguments, for example, I have a Java method that loops through 
a token list, looking for commas and doing a little
bit of logic with matching parens/brackets/braces:

List&lt;List&lt;Token&gt;&gt; parseArgs(List&lt;Token&gt; tokens);

Each argument is returned as a List of Tokens, and so all arguments are 
just a List of Lists of Tokens.
To someone who knows ANTLR well, this approach may not seem any easier, 
but I do.
Then again, I hate it when I see CSS syntax inside HTML, so maybe it's 
just me :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Correct me if I'm wrong, but I get the impression you're thinking 
</I>&gt;<i> about writing by hand a bunch of the AST parsing logic that Antlr 
</I>&gt;<i> generates automatically for tree grammars, rather the way you might 
</I>&gt;<i> need to proceed if you were using a less sophisticated parser 
</I>&gt;<i> generator (lex/yacc, etc.)
</I>
No, No. I use ANTLR for all lexing and parsing, I would never do that by 
hand. It's just that I'm doing translation from token-stream
to token-stream (generally avoiding parsing) rather than from AST-to-AST.

&gt;<i> In that case, yes, it would definitely be a pain because you might 
</I>&gt;<i> need to do it all by hand.  But if I understand Antlr correctly, it 
</I>&gt;<i> saves you the trouble by supporting tree grammar.  So the interesting 
</I>&gt;<i> contrast is not necessarily between your approach and Antlr's, but 
</I>&gt;<i> between Antlr v. other parser generators.
</I>
One key difference with ANTLR vs. Jazillian is that Terence gets to 
design the ANTLR input grammar, but I didn't get
to design the C input grammar. This way, the ANTLR input grammar is well 
designed, and designed to do everything that
ANTLR needs it to do. By contrast, the C grammar isn't quite so great. 
For example, I want to handle preprocessor stuff
(#include, #define, etc) with the same approach that I use for 
everything else. And yet the C language grammar knows
nothing at all about preprocessor directives.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All for now.  I'm not sure I agree with your paper, but it has 
</I>&gt;<i> certainly provoked thought.

Thanks for the input.

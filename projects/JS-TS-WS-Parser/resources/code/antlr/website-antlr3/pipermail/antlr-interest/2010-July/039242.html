having UNIONALL and EXCEPTALL tokens produced by the lexer is (IMHO) the
best way to go (but i have an alternative below, if my lexing suggestion
does not work...)

add a tokens { UNIONALL; EXCEPTALL; } section to your grammar just after
your options {...} section but before any rule.

modify the lexer rules for UNION and EXCEPT to be:

UNION : U N I O N ( WS A L L { $type=UNIONALL; } )? ;
EXCEPT : E X C E P T ( WS A L L { $type=EXCEPTALL; } )? ;
fragment WS :
    ( ' ' | '\t' | '\r' | '\n' )+ ; // token delimiting white-space

and now your modified query_exp rule above should work....

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I tried to use a rewrite rule. I used an Integer to keep track of which
</I>&gt;<i> option (UNION/EXCEPT, maybe ALL) was chosen and put several conditioned
</I>&gt;<i> rewrite rules. The problem was the Integer in the Parser was inside an
</I>&gt;<i> if-clause and could not be read.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> if ( state.backtracking==0 ) {
</I>&gt;<i>               int MYINTEGER = 0;
</I>&gt;<i>             }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally I tinkered with an additional rule where I build a String for the
</I>&gt;<i> option taken (EXCEPT ALL, EXCEPT.. etc) and tried to return this. I think I
</I>&gt;<i> was on the wrong track there.. it did not work at all.
</I>
the second alternative (if the above lexing changes do not work out) is
similar to this (sort of). e.g. use a parsing rule to recognize the
union/except operator.

still need the tokens { } section for UNIONALL and EXCEPTALL

no change to the lexer.

add parser rule (very much untested, but should work, i think):

query_operator : UNION | EXCEPT
   | (tok=UNION ALL -&gt; UNIONALL[$tok,&quot;UNIONALL&quot;] )
   | (tok=EXCEPT ALL -&gt; EXCEPTALL[$tok,&quot;EXCEPTALL&quot;] )
   ;

query_exp : query_term ( query_operator^ query_term )* ;

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Probably the solution is very simple and I just cant find. I would be very
</I>&gt;<i> thankfull for some input.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm using ANTLR 3.1.2
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
hope this helps...

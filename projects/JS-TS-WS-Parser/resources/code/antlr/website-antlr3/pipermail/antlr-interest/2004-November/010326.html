Just for me, as I tend to be a little sluggish: You use the ANTLR
grammar (for C) and let it generate the AST? Which is something that
can be done without any idea of ANTLR... Then you access this AST and
make the translation to Java as explained in your article, right?
Well, you would at least have to know the structure of the AST, or am
I getting it all wrong again?

 &gt; Right, but the whole point of the tree grammar is to minimize
&gt;<i> the amount of code that you have to write. What's the point
</I>&gt;<i> of embedding 30,000 lines of code inside a 350 line grammar,
</I>&gt;<i> if you could have just written 30,020 lines that do the same
</I>&gt;<i> thing?
</I>
I thought it might be because of readability and maintenance. Where
you have a separation of what describes the structure (the AST
traversal notation) and what is to be done (the Java code).

&gt;<i> Only if a top-down walk of the tree is the basis of the
</I>&gt;<i> code that you need. If your code is something else (like
</I>&gt;<i> applying a series of pattern-matching rules), then
</I>&gt;<i> you have to write all the code even when using a tree grammar.
</I>
I think this is a strong argument. When you think of natural language
processing (or the translation Andy does) there hardly is
one-after-the-other processing.

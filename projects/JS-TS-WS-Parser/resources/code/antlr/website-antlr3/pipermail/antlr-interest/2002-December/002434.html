The 30th version has the C# integrated :)  Try it out :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, I have a question about heterogeneous ASTs that relates

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   ASTNode n = new MyTypeOfNode();
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and that this has been changed to something like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   ASTNode n = getASTFactory().createInstance(&quot;MyTypeOfNode&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yep.

&gt;<i> Internally, the factory appears to be using reflection to go from the
</I>&gt;<i> string type name to a new object of that type.  (I should qualify
</I>&gt;<i> that I'm talking about the C# code, and assuming that the Java code
</I>&gt;<i> does something similar.)
</I>
Correct.

&gt;<i> Isn't creating an object in this way significantly more expensive?
</I>&gt;<i> If you're creating, say, thousands of nodes of many different types,
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't one expect slower performance?
</I>
Yes.  Oddly, the java version runs faster than before for homogeneous 
creation (the only real test I had), which I didn't bother to 
investigate.  It uses the reflection thing too I believe.

&gt;<i>  Given that the type
</I>&gt;<i> information *is* known at compile time, why pay the overhead of run-
</I>&gt;<i> time object creation?
</I>
Consistency for one.  Flexibility for two: no point in a factory if you 
don't use ;)

&gt;<i> This isn't an argument against using a factory.  The factory could do
</I>&gt;<i> a big switch statement (or the equivalent) on the name, like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> case &quot;MyTypeOfNode&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i>   return new MyTypeOfNode();
</I>
I'd have to generate it though.  You are free to build your own that 
does this though.  Literally I tried to add an IF to check for the 
CommonAST type and then do &quot;new CommonAST&quot; and it was slower!

&gt;<i> and then resort to the run-time way at the end:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> default:
</I>&gt;<i>   return createInstance(&quot;MyTypeOfNode&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although, come to think of it, it's not obvious to me exactly what
</I>&gt;<i> the advantage of the factory approach is in this context?
</I>
Only that you can track or otherwise play with the node creation w/o 
changing the generated code.

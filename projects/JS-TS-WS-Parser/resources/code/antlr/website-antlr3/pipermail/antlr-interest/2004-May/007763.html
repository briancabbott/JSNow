<PRE>Hi,

I see yours too :)

&gt;<i> But in my opinion allowing assignments in the calling rules in guessing
</I>&gt;<i> mode is rather dangereous. First of all, because this does not have any
</I>&gt;<i> clear semantics in general: what is the sense of assignment of a value
</I>&gt;<i> whose computation was not triggered (except init actions)? 
</I>
The way antlr generates code it will always return something. So something
will get constructed if you're unlucky (and did not anticipate on it)

&gt;<i> Secondly, running assignment operators may have side effects
</I>&gt;<i> which are inacceptable in guessing mode. User might want assignment
</I>&gt;<i> operator of his own object to do anything, for instance, it might
</I>&gt;<i> perform some registration of an object in a special object-directory and
</I>&gt;<i> increment some counter. Surely, running this registration operation
</I>&gt;<i> several times won't be desired.
</I>
You could wonder if you should be using such side effect containing objects
in a part of the parser where you're still using guessing mode. E.g. one or
two tree transformations away you can do it in one go without having to use
predicates. (Apart from the discussion if it's a good idea to have too many
side effects in operators, but that's nitpicking ;) )

&gt;<i> In my humble opinion it's better if such semantically dubious situations
</I>&gt;<i> are prohibited. At least I would like a program I use to run in the safe
</I>&gt;<i> mode by default. And for users who do know what they are doing there
</I>&gt;<i> might be a special loose mode.
</I>
It could be good yes. But it might be an attempt to overengineer. The user
is usually a pure genious when it comes to finding a way to use a tool in a
way that it was never intended ;)

Well enough 'shoddy' arguments against it, I peeked at the codegen a bit
and I'm not seeing a way to implement this is in the current framework
without serious redesigning/writing. I guess you'll have to live with it...

Cheers,

Ric

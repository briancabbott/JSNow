You're quite right: I entirely neglected to mention that my little language
is dynamically typed.  That was an important bit to leave out.  Dynamic
typing was one of my preliminary user requirements leading me down this
rabbit hole.  But as I begin to appreciate some of the implications, I
wonder if the runtime cleverness we originally sought is worth the added
complexity.  Of course, only my users can answer that.  Your reply has
helped greatly to sharpen my thinking on the subject.  Thank you.

cheers,

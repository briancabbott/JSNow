<PRE>Hei chalani

A &quot;class not found exception&quot; is a classpath problem, even if you say 
you're sure. I don't think that there's compatibility issues. You'd 
might consider joining the org.eclipse.newcomer newsgroup and ask there. 
Please also post your plugin descriptor files, plugin.xml manifest.mf 
plugin.properties, and the exception stack trace, or tell us at least 
_which_ class is not found...  As I told you before, I use Antlr 
successfully from inside my eclipse plugin, so don't worry, I am sure 
it's a plugin related classpath problem.

&gt;<i> For the project that i'm currently working on is built on Eclipse 3.2, 
</I>&gt;<i> and for that project I'm using antlr.jar. This jar which i was 
</I>&gt;<i> imported is from the ANTLR 2.7.6.b1 version. The project working fine 
</I>&gt;<i> when i run it as 'Run as Java Application' but i need to run my 
</I>&gt;<i> project as 'Run As Eclipse Application'. But my project is not working 
</I>&gt;<i> and it shows something like unable to load a class file in my project. 
</I>&gt;<i> The exception was thrown from the CharScanner class in the ANTLR jar. 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure about the class path settings.

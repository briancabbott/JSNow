<PRE>Hi Ranco,

I'll add a simple delegate grammar example to the tests I use here and find
a way to make it work. :)

If you are using Visual Studio (or MSBuild in particular, which is the
standard VS build system), then you'll definitely want to use the C# port of
the tool. I highly recommend this route because it's both easy to work with
and doesn't prod you to check your generated grammar files into source
control. While the following documentation makes specific references to
Visual Studio 2010, everything except section 1.1 (the IDE language support
package) applies equally to Visual Studio 2008.

Subject: [antlr-interest] [CSharp3] rule visibility in composite grammars

Hi all/Sam,

While using the CSharp3 target on a composite grammar, I came across a few
issues regarding rule visibility.

If no modifier (private, protected, public, ...) is specified for a rule,
the Java target generates public methods (since it is not implemented IIRC)
and the CSharp3 target generates private methods.

I like the idea to explicitly specify which rules are callable (by making
them public). However, for composite grammars the generated parser contains
delegate rules for every rule of the imported grammar, even for rules in the
imported grammar that aren't public (causing compile errors). This can
solved this adding a public modifier to every rule of the imported grammar,
but I was wondering if there's a more convenient way of doing this.

Furthermore, the methods for the delegate rules in the composite grammars
are all public, regardless of the visibility of the rule in the imported
grammar. IMHO, it would be better to make them private and use the composite
grammar to explicitly specify the rules that are externally visible. What
are your thoughts on this?

Btw, the CSharp3 templates are also included in the original Java tool. Does
that mean that we don't need the .NET version of the tool anymore?

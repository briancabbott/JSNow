Erm, Is there anyway for the parser to communicate with the lexer to pass
calling context down to this rule which will enable
run-time setting of the testLiterals=true option ?

Stuff in the tokens section gets tested in rules that have the option
testLiterals turned on. A token defined in a rule will always be matched and
passed on the the parser (unless it's a protected rule)

Usually you turn of testLiterals globally in your lexer grammar then enable
it for a number of rules that match keywords or the likes (check for
instance the tincy example) here the ID rule from it:

ID
options {
        testLiterals = true;
        paraphrase = &quot;an identifier&quot;;
}
        :       ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'|'_') ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'|'_'|'0'..'9')*
        ;

ID matches all stuff resembling an identifier, but before the ID token is
returned to the parser a hash table is checked that's generated from the
tokens section and if a match is found that token is returned.	 

Cheers,

Ric

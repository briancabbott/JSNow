<PRE>Thanks. Actually, Monty's solution should work ...

but seeing as you seem to know these things, taking this line from my
original post

	(id:IDENT {if text != &quot;REM&quot; throw tokenmatchexception}|&quot;*&quot;|&quot;!&quot;)

which is the exception I need to throw here?

I think if I've got this, I've got enough to write my filter :-) While
the LB() function might be useful, further thought on what Monty said
made me think it might not be needed.

So - I can feed the lexer output into my deremer parser - and I can then
feed the output from that into my main parser?

And if I have a rule like

commentst : (EOL | SEMI) (&quot;*&quot; | &quot;!&quot;)! (~(EOL)*)! ;

it will then eat everything between the initial eol/semi and final eol,
but it will let those two tokens through to the next parser?

Cheers,
Wol

That one is a bit inefficient due to an exception per character:

This is a dirty one but it works:

comment: REMARK ( { if( LA(1) == NEWLINE ) break; } : . )* ;

Tip: read the generated code.

Cheers,

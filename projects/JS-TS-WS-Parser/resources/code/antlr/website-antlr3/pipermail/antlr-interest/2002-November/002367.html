<PRE>I have a line oriented grammar. Under some conditions determined only 
after matching a pattern in the parser, I want to discard the 
reminder of the line. In most cases, the contents of the remainder of 
the line contains arbitrary characters and symbols.

I tried to use: consumeUntil('\n') but I get an occasional 
TokenStreamRecognitionException on a character or symbol not 
expected. In additon, what I presume to be the input character 
pointer does not advance past that point. (not sure exactly how it 
works:-))

How do I advance past the unwanted characters, until the newline 
character is reached, based on a decision made while parsing?  

In JavaCC I would use an alternative scanner (lexer) state to define 
all characters that are not a newline as skip characters. Can I put 
the ANTLR lexer into an alternative state similar to JavaCC? How?

Can't use facilities from the lexer (ie. setting token type 
to 'antlr::Token::SKIP') as the characters/symbols are valid in 
normal context.

Help would be greatly appreciated.

<PRE>Hello,

I am interested in running antlr/stringtemplate on Silverlight. I already had a look/stab at the changes required to do so (I looked at it a few weeks back and am currently looking at all the changes since then).
Looking at the archives I noticed that there seem to be a few other people interested in this issue. Because nobody ever came forward with a solution I would like to offer some help.

Who would I have to talk to in order to figure out a strategy and get things going?

As far as I can tell most of the implementation could stay identical/very close to the current CSharp3 implementation. We would have to decide what should be duplicated/linked/#if(SILVERLIGHT)-ed and how to resolve certain lacks of functionality (e.g. missing SerializationInfo type) in Silverlight.

Kind regards,

Simon

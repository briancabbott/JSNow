&quot;extended ASCII&quot; and &quot;8-bit ASCII&quot; are terms that aren't based in
any standard and so they mostly get in the way of seeing what's going
on here.  ASCII is a 7-bit code that uses the values 0x00 - 0x7F,
exclusively.

I don't see your code for providing the input to the ANTLR lexer,
but it seems likely that it's coming as a Java character stream
(i.e. there is a java.io.Reader involved).  The Reader's job is
to convert external, byte-oriented character representations into
Unicode characters. ANTLR folks can easily picture a Reader
as a kind of pre-lexer that consumes bytes and emits chars.
Its &quot;lexer grammar&quot; is determined by a character set name,
which you can pass to an InputStreamReader constructor, for
example.

\uFFFD, the Unicode &quot;REPLACEMENT CHARACTER&quot; (I'm not shouting,
Unicode official char names are always in caps) is exactly what
a Reader is expected to emit if it hits a byte sequence that
violates the lexical grammar of its character set.  If you had
a Reader that expected ASCII input, the results you're seeing
are what you would get.

To get the behavior that you seem to be looking for, you could
create a Reader for the character set &quot;iso-8859_1&quot;. This character
set just happens to consist of exactly the one-byte sequences
0x00 - 0xff which it maps directly into the chars \u0000 - \u00ff.

Some time way back in ANTLR 2 days I remember thinking how nice
it would be if you could explicitly define a byte-oriented
rather than char-oriented lexer (i.e. ANTLR could have both
CharLexer and ByteLexer classes derived from a common
base recognizer class that did almost all the work, but you
would ask it to generate a byte lexer when your language
specification wasn't Unicode-based, and completely avoid
jumping through Unicode-related hoops).  I haven't yet caught
up enough with ANTLR 3 to see whether that's possible, but if
not the best bet is just to treat your input explicitly as
iso-8859_1-encoded characters.

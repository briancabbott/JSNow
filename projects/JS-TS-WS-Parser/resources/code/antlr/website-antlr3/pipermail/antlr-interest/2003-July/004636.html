<PRE>A *BIG* problem with a questionnaire like that - especially if filled in
at download - is users like me. An experienced (guru?) programmer, but
with no oo or compiler experience, most of those questions would have
made perfect sense syntactically, but been semantically incomprehensible
... :-)

Designing good questionnaires is extremely hard work!

Cheers,
Wol

It might be nice to have every ANTLR user fill out
a quick questionaire. I think this was mentioned in the cabal notes.
Here are my suggestions for some questions to ask to get a feel
for what people are doing with ANTLR and who these people are.

To get a true picture, it might be necessary to have people answer
these questions when downloading ANTLR, rather than posting to the
mailing list, as there may be a lot of users who don't follow the list.

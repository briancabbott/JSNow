Not at all. Highlighting the issue on the list increases the
likelihood of a solution.

&gt;<i> Java isn't present on

</I>barrier to
&gt;<i> entry is high enough on Windows that it may discourage people from using
</I>&gt;<i> Antlr, and that would be a real shame.
</I>
These are some good points that the ANTLR community has already
started addressing. The file sharing section of the website contains
the following binary downloads for ANTLR:

1. GCJ/Cygwin - stand alone executable that requires Cygwin.
2. GCJ/MingW - stand alone executable with no dependency on Cygwin.
3. J#.NET - stand alone executable that requires the .NET framework
and the J# runtime libraries (this is for 2.7.2 but the related
project files package may be a basis for getting a J# exe for 2.7.4)

&gt;<i> Perhaps when I have time to come up for air, I'll package the antlr
</I>stuff up
&gt;<i> in a Windows installer and submit it to the antlr site, along with MSVC
</I>&gt;<i> project files and such.
</I>
I'm sure that would be appreciated.

&gt;<i> Far as the studies you cite go, all they prove is that Java appears
</I>to be
&gt;<i> the proper tool for those particular projects, and I don't doubt that at
</I>&gt;<i> all.
</I>
Perhaps. They also show an increase in productivity even when the
developers were C++ veterans just learning Java.

&gt;<i> There's no question Java offers many benefits and it is a good choice
</I>&gt;<i> for many types of programming.  I just don't think parsing is something
</I>&gt;<i> you'd want to do in a language with the runtime overhead of Java.  I
</I>&gt;<i> probably wouldn't write a parser in a .NET language for the same reason.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe a prototype, but not production code.
</I>
The issue isn't so much the runtime overhead or increased memory
consumption IMO. It's much more a lack of native support for what Tim
Bray termed &quot;Heavy Text Processing&quot; -
<A HREF="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/30/JavaStrings">http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/30/JavaStrings</A>

I'd venture that this is only an issue for a [very] small percentage
of systems that perform parsing and your project sounds like one of them.

With regards to the .NET platform (C# esp.), pointers make all the
difference. Assuming you can use them, none of this applies.

&gt;<i> Which brings me back to my original question of &quot;why Java?&quot; for this
</I>type of
&gt;<i> thing?  I suppose for light duty parsing requirements it might be
</I>ok, but

Precisely. The ANTLR tool itself is a &quot;light duty parsing tool&quot; and
would be just as useful if it had been written in VBScript or Awk.
Java's productivity benefits and painless cross-OS portability were
more important than C/C++'s support for low-level bit-twiddling.

&gt;<i> I can't imagine that an Antlr-generated Java lexer/parser could ever
</I>approach
&gt;<i> the speed of a fully optimized C++ one.
</I>
Not without &quot;tweakable&quot; pointer types (unsafe/native C# for example
would scream). But it can do much better than most parsing systems
actually *need*.

&gt;<i> I'm rarely in favor of sacrificing
</I>&gt;<i> runtime efficiency for programmer convenience.
</I>
Productivity, not convenience. It is often more important to be able
to quickly produce 5 adequately efficient systems in a given time
frame than just one insanely fast system.

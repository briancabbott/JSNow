<PRE>Oliver--

You can do better by deferring the actions--basically, build a 
monster case statement including all of the possible actions in a 
grammar--and execute them after matching a rule.  Then you can 
trigger a set of actions at &quot;commit&quot; points.  Functional languages 
make this sort of lazy evaluation easier.  Rolling back actions is 
trickier--you have to have some sort of mechanism to record state, 
or the cost for checkpoint/rollback is very high.

For that matter, you can defer all actions until the entire grammar 
is recognized as long as the actions do not affect the parse.  
Editing of a generated tree might be trickier, but not that 
difficult--you just insert code for that in the list of deferred 
actions.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; While he has linear time &quot;backtracking&quot; performance, ANTLR is 
</I>worst
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; case exponential. I was wondering why: ANTLR does not combine 
</I>its
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; depth first search (aka backtracking in this context) into a 
</I>table
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; while Bryan's approach does (at least I understand it this 
</I>way). The
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; problem Bryan will come across (given my understanding is 
</I>halfway
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; correct) is ACTIONS. As with LR and combined states, the 
</I>problem is
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; when to execute associated semantic actions. The drawback is 
</I>well
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; known and and leads to reduction in parsing power.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Might sound weird, but I thought if we still combined states 
</I>even
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; though they are associated with different actions and simple 
</I>execute
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; all actions, there would be no loss of power :) Silly? Not if 
</I>you have
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; a transactional language that allows you to roll back actions 
</I>that
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; turn out to be invalid later and roll forward the valid ones.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Technically this is possible. Does it make sense as well? Am I 
</I>slowly
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; going crazy? ;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You are already crazy like me ;) &lt;snicker, snort&gt;.  Just got 
</I>mail from 
&gt;<i> &gt; him. :)  Hope it's ok to repeat part here:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - Packrat parsing guarantees linear-time parsing on all the 
</I>types of 
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; grammars
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it supports, which amounts to everything that fits the 
</I>formalism or
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;conceptual model&quot; of parsing expression grammars.  But 
</I>the &quot;pure&quot;
&gt;<i> PEG 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; model
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; doesn't directly support &quot;stateful&quot; grammars like those of C 
</I>and C++, 
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; which you have to build up symbol tables and such that 
</I>effectively 
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; modify the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; grammar mid-stream as the parser scans the input from left to 
</I>right.  
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; From
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; what I've seen so far, it appears fundamentally difficult or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; impossible to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; make a packrat parser support stateful grammars efficiently 
</I>without
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; effectively turning it into a deterministic (e.g., LR) parser.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, the actions are the problem for everyone :)

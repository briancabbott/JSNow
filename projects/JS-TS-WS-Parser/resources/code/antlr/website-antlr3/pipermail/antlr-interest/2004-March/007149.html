<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; - As my toy example tries to indicate, &quot;-&quot; can mean three different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; things, depending on the context
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's what parsers and tree grammars are good at.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The whitespace first pass is important, because I want to pass
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grape[fruit] completely differently from grape [fruit]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> FWIW, that's a *really* bad idea in a language.
</I>
It's also not under my control.  I am given a language, I need to
parse it, so I'm interested in ideas on how to do it with ANTLR, if
possible.  I didn't design this language.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; I want to be able to deal with unexpected input at fine granularity and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recovery, to minimize parse failures, e.g., if I see 1+2* is 7 I want to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not go below the &quot;word&quot; level in the first &quot;token&quot; &quot;1+2*&quot; because I don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want to try to parse an expression and fail.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I noted, you can write a very permissive lexer and a permissive parser
</I>&gt;<i> and then do whatever specific checks via multiple tree grammars.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Have fun,
</I>&gt;<i> 	John
</I>
Context-sensitivity, including the whitespace issue, makes this
difficult.  For example:
       grape[fruit]
should be differently parsed from
       grape [C { int i; }]
and differently parsed from
       grape [Perl { my $i = 3; }]

I need multiple lexers, not just one permissive lexer.

Now, I do know how to multiplex lexers dynamically, and have done so
in the past in a different task in constrained circumstances (such as
the Java/JavaDoc example), but the task here seems to require more
than that.

I think that where I am stuck is that ANTLR allows me to take a text
stream to a token stream by means of a lexer, then a token stream to a
tree by means of a parser, and a tree to something else by means of a
tree parser, but what I want is to turn a token i for language A
(permissive) into a token stream for language B_i, and then have all
the B_i conconcatened into a new token stream for language C.

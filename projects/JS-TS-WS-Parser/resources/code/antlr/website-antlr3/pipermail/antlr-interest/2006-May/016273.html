<PRE>Ter:

Just my 2 cents, FWIW...

I don't think Antlr should concern itself with any of this.  Keep things as
simple as possible, and only do exact ordinal comparisons of strings.

If you need a case-insensitive lexer, the end user should implement that by
overriding an appropriate method in the lexer and use whatever comparison is
appropriate for their particular needs.  There is no universal upper or
lower-casing function that is appropriate for every possible locale, so why
even go down that road?   Keep the core of Antlr simple, and just provide
extensibility points (with samples) where appropriate.

This is probably a codegen issue more than a core Antlr issue, but one of
the biggest frustrations for me in Antlr 2.x is that the whole thing assumes
8-byte characters and strings.  There are hard-coded references to string,
stream, char, LPSTR, cout, etc. throughout the generated code as well as the
runtime code.  These should be defines or typedefs, so generating a Unicode
parser (UTF-16) would be as simple as doing something like '#define
ANTLR_STRING wstring', '#define ANTLR_CHAR wchar_t', and so on.

Another problem is the various hard-coded ANSI, English strings in error
messages, and hard coded references to cout.  Please abstract anything like
this so that it can be overridden, so error messages can be localized, and
other output mechanisms can be used other than an ANSI console.  It's a big
world out there and modern applications today need to support Unicode and
easy localization.

<PRE>I've been playing with Antlr/Antlrworks 3.0ea8 - a fantastic
combination, but....

I'm having trouble getting my rules to return values. Have they been
replaced with some feature of the @scope mechanism?

If I try something like:

aRule returns [MyClass anInstance] : SOME TOKEN STUFF ;

I get code that looks like:

public MyClass aRule {
 
  MyClass anInstance;
.
.
.

  return anInstance;

}

Which refuses to compile with a 'anInstance may not have been
initialised' error.


If I try:

aRule returns [MyClass anInstance = null] : SOME TOKEN STUFF ;


I get something like:

public void MyClass = aRule() {
.
.
.
}


(Something like that, I don't have the code here at work).


I'm sure it's something I'm doing wrong, any ideas what it might be?

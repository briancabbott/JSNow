<PRE>I think maybe my original post was confusing. What I meant was is that I need to produce multiple output files from a single AST, not alternative output formats like in cminus. That is, I need to generate a structure definition header file, a structure initialization C file, etc. So ideally, a single run through a single tree grammar would produce multiple string template &quot;streams&quot;.

I had one more thought. Is it possible to use ANTLR StringTemplate integration and produce more than one StringTemplate from a rule, if I explicitly declare the rule to have multiple StringValues as the rule return type?

Hi,

I have a project where I have to produce multiple output files (C source files) from a single AST. It seems clear at this point that using StringTemplate to produce the output files makes the most sense. So how do I get multiple StringTemplate &quot;streams&quot; from a single AST? I can think two ways:


1.       Write separate tree grammars to produce the separate outputs, using built-in ANTLR-to-StringTemplate integration.

2.       Write one tree grammar, and use helper functions to build the separate outputs using manual creation of StringTemplates.

3.       Or is there another way?

Approach #1 has the advantage of being able to use the built in integration between ANTLR and StringTemplate. But the disadvantage is that if I change the AST structure, I have to change all the tree grammar files, rerun the code generation, etc. Right now I'm leaning towards the helper functions which construct StringTemplates manually. Does anyone have any advice? I'm assuming that I can't use ANTLR-StringTemplate integration and also produce multiple StringTemplates with a single tree grammar. Do I have this right?

Hi Andy,

Take a look at the cminus example in <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/download/examples-v3.tar.gz.">http://www.antlr.org/download/examples-v3.tar.gz.</A> Cminus demonstrates String Templates by emitting source code for Python, Java, and Bytecode.



Hope that helps, Eric

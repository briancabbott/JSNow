<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i>             After running preprocessor manually, preprocessod code is
</I>&gt;<i> different (not in semantic but syntatic) from original code. And if I
</I>&gt;<i> convert this preprocessod code to c++ code (without classes, only
</I>&gt;<i> compatible to g++) such that it is compile by g++ compiler
</I>
you do realise that C is a proper subset of C++, e.g. that any valid C
program is also a valid C++ program? If you just replace all occurrences
of &quot;gcc&quot; in the Makefiles of the Linux kernel with &quot;g++&quot; you will be
able to compile the kernel just as before.

&gt;<i>  then this
</I>&gt;<i> translated code is also without any macros (preprocessor statement) but
</I>&gt;<i> that I dont want. 
</I>
C++ includes pre-processor macros as a language feature, albeit they are
usually not used to the degree they are in C. Pre-processed C++ files
will contain the defines of all header files they include in their body,
which will render the classes completely unusable.

&gt;<i> I only want to do is making C code compile by g++
</I>&gt;<i> compiler. And this I want to do automatically and dont want to change
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary codes.
</I>
Any code compilable by gcc is compilable by g++.

&gt;<i> If I manually first do preprocessing then I think it ll not fulfilled my
</I>&gt;<i> goal.
</I>
You mean by manually calling &quot;/lib/cpp&quot; or by replacing all the macros?
The first is not really manual, the later is probably close to
impossible in a project as big as the Linux kernel. Especially as you'd
have to come up with a equally powerful C++ programming technique as a
replacement for each.

I don't really see the point in what you're trying to do.

Martin

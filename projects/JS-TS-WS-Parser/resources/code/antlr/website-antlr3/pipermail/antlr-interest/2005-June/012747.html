<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'm using ANTLR to process an AST (currently, just semantic checking for 
</I>&gt;<i>a simple C-like language, with scanning and tree construction in 
</I>&gt;<i>lex/yacc). Writing this code has got me thinking about what exactly 
</I>&gt;<i>ANTLR is buying me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My grammar basically calls various methods at the nodes of the tree, 
</I>&gt;<i>storing results in the node, and passing information up the tree. However:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>1) The tree structure itself is known to be correct because I wrote it 
</I>&gt;<i>myself from the front-end code. If the tree structure is known to be 
</I>&gt;<i>correct, is there any point in using ANTLR? I could just as easily (more 
</I>&gt;<i>easily, in fact) traverse the tree manually, and the required checking 
</I>&gt;<i>code is too complex to put in the grammar file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>2) I don't actually need to know what the tree structure is to do 
</I>&gt;<i>semantic checking. Having to specify the structure in ANTLR syntax then 
</I>&gt;<i>just becomes another potential failure point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>At some point I also need to do some simple transformations on the tree. 
</I>&gt;<i>Ok, I could do this with ANTLR, but it'll also be pretty simple just to 
</I>&gt;<i>do manual in-situ transformations of the tree, rather than generating an 
</I>&gt;<i>entire new tree.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Any thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i>

See Terence's &quot;Translators should use Tree Grammars&quot; article:
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/article/1100569809276/use.tree.grammars.tml">http://www.antlr.org/article/1100569809276/use.tree.grammars.tml</A>
for all the reasons why using ANTLR to walk your AST is the best thing 
since sliced bread.

See my lttle thing titled &quot;The Problem with Tree Walkers&quot;:
<A HREF="http://jazillian.com/antlr/trees.html">http://jazillian.com/antlr/trees.html</A> for my reasons for prefering to 
just walk ASTs by hand,
rather than using ANTLR treewalkers.

See a long thread titled &quot;Translators should use tree walkers&quot; back in 
November...
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2004-November/thread.html">http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2004-November/thread.html</A>
where I take a brutal beating for refusing to see why ANTLR treewalkers 
are better
than walking an AST &quot;by hand&quot;.

After all that, you know my opinion: if you've already got an AST, just 
write a little code
to walk it. Embedding your actions in an ANTLR treewalker won't buy you 
anything, IMO.

<PRE>If I wanted to make a parse tree for a language so I can transform it into 
another tree, is there any use in creating a non tree grammar for that 
language?

I am slightly confused about when to use the different types of grammars 
(token or tree).  At first I was under the impression you make the token 
grammar then convert to the tree.  If that is correct why would you do 
that?  If it is wrong what is the normal way to do it.  I looked at some 
examples and they seem to either be completly seperate or a mixture of 
both whichs leads me to my middle ground of not understanding.

Thanks
Ron

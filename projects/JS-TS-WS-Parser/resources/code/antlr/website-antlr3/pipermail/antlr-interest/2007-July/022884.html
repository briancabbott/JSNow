<PRE>
I have a situation where (I think) I need a syntactic predicate in my
lexer grammar. I have to deal with a section of input that contains
arbitrary text terminated by a keyword. This is similar to the
multi-line comment case, but differs in that the keyword is case
insensitive. Here's the relevant part of the grammar...


lexer grammar example;

fragment SOME_TEXT_BEGIN
    : ('S'|'s') ('O'|'o') ('M'|'m') ('E'|'e')
      '_' ('T'|'t') ('E'|'e') ('X'|'x') ('T'|'t')
    ;

fragment SOME_TEXT_END
    : ('S'|'s') ('O'|'o') ('M'|'m') ('E'|'e')
      '_' ('T'|'t') ('E'|'e') ('X'|'x') ('T'|'t')
      '_' ('E'|'e') ('N'|'n') ('D'|'d')
    ;

SOME_TEXT
    : SOME_TEXT_BEGIN
      ( options {greedy = false;} . )*
      ( SOME_TEXT_END ) =&gt; SOME_TEXT_END
    ;


In the generated code there is the expected call to synpred1(), but the
problem is that no synpred1() function is generated!

I've had to resort to the following definition for SOME_TEXT...


SOME_TEXT
    : SOME_TEXT_BEGIN
      ( options {greedy = false;} . )*
      ( 'SOME_TEXT_END' | 'some_text_end' | 'Some_Text_End' )
    ;


As you can see, providing explicit alternatives for each combination of
upper/lower case letters would be less than desirable.

Is this a bug in ANTLR or am I missing something?
Is there some other way to deal with a situation like this?

Thanks,
John

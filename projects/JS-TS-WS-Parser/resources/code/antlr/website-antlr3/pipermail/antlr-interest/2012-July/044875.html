<PRE>Generally, you'd have someone send you a signed consent form, separate from
the pull request itself, that covers &quot;pull requests sent to the ANTLR
project from account ____&quot; owned by that person. If you get a pull request
from someone who doesn't already have that agreement in place, send them a
message that you need the consent form before being able to consider the
request.

Subject: [antlr-interest] pull requests at github

Howdy,

people are now submitting nice pull request to the ANTLR project software,
but I have to keep the license clean. That's why I used to accept things
through the feedback page:

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/misc/feedback">http://www.antlr.org/misc/feedback</A>

or with the contributors license agreement. I submitted a feature request to
github to add such a license granting clause to the pull requests. they like
the idea, but I haven't heard back about implementation.

What if we set up a webpage similar to the feedback page (current text
enclosed at the bottom) with a text box where people can submit a URL to a
pull request, certifying the origin of the material in that pull request.
The name/username/email etc. would have to match.very messy.

As a result of the certificate of origin, I could automatically post a
comment to the pull request so that it somehow links the certificate.

Does anybody have any process or legal advice?

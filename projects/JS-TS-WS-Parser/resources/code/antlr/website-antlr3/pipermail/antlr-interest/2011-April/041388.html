<PRE>&gt;<i> It's not clear from your question if only method calls are legal within a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;with&quot; statement, in which case the suggestions made should work, or if (as
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect) any statement is legal within a &quot;with&quot;, like in javascript.
</I>
Thanks for the replies, everyone.

You're correct, Peter, it is not limited to only method calls. I don't
think parameter passing will work, since the enclosed statement block
is not part of the withStatement rule. I (over-?) simplified my
example grammar fragment as an illustration; withStatement and the
stuff inside the With block are all &quot;statements&quot; in higher rules, so
I'd need to pass parameters among large numbers of rules, which is
doesn't seem very maintainable. Isn't this exactly what a scope was
intended for?

Assuming this is an appropriate place to use a scope, how do I get
that withStatement ID value into a scope instead of into a parameter?

Thanks again!
</PRE>

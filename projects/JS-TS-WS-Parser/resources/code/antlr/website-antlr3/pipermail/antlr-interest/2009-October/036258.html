<PRE>Hi.  I've been using ANTLR (ANTLRWorks, actually, which is very nice) to 
implement a project-specific search language, sort of like google's. 
I've gotten it mostly working, though it's taken some time and 
experimentation to understand the details.  In my grammar, I've defined 
a searchTerms parser rule, which is one or more searchTerm:

	searchTerm+;

searchTerm matches a SEARCH_TERM token, which can be a number or word 
(with some special characters like '*' allowed).  The number is the 
usual definition for a floating point number:

	('-'|'+')?((DIGIT+)|(DIGIT*'.'DIGIT+));

which I hope is correct.  (DIGIT is the fragment 0..9.)  I'm also 
sending whitespace to the HIDDEN channel, as is often recommended.  It 
seems like a side effect of this is that this input:

4.66.34

which isn't a valid number, gets parsed as two different terms: 4.66 and 
.34.  Is there some way to require whitespace between my search terms so 
that input isn't allowed?  When I was parsing words, this wasn't a 
problem.  I wouldn't be surprised if my design is a bit wrong still, and 
that's what's put me in this position.

I can't post the entire grammar, unfortunately.

Thanks for any pointers,
Reid

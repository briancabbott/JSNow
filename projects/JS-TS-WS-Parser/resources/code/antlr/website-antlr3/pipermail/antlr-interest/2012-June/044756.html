<PRE>What I want to do is make it easier to write an EDSL by having it
specified like any other grammar, generating Java interfaces to
represent the grammar's various rules, as well as basic
implementations of these, which I expect will accumulate &quot;tokens&quot;
extracted from method arguments specified in fluent fashion.  In fact,
spelling it out here makes it sound as though it might be just as
reasonable for the end result of a series of calls upon the
implementation of this EDSL interface to create a (parse?) tree, which
could then be walked to resolve the final result of such a series of
method invocations.  This would have the benefit that such a tree
walker (parse, AST, what-have-you) would be equally applicable to a
tree generated from a &quot;normal&quot; ANTLR-generated Java Parser
implementation.

Is that more clear?

Thanks for your interest,
Matt

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Implement a custom code generation target for ANTLR 4
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Use ANTLRMorph with the ANTLR 3-based ANTLR 4 meta-grammar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It might well be the case that these differ only in the manner in

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opinions on which approach is to be preferred? &#160;Failing that, I am

Wow, I think this question is backwards.  I learned ANTLR from the  
book as I wrote
a nontrivial translator.  I developed it using the time-honored  
tradition of adding only
what was needed.  An AST never was, so my translator never grew an  
AST.  Yet it
does the job very well.  To me, evaluate-as-you-parse is the normal  
case, and the
question is &quot;what are ASTs good for, other than speeding things up if  
you need
multiple passes?&quot;.

There are many languages (most?) that can be translated without an  
AST phase.
If I don't need one, why bother?  Perhaps ASTs add some nice  
modularity, or
compartmentalize semantic errors or something?  I'm ready to be  
convinced, but I
want some value to compensate for the complexity they add to the  
translation process.

I took a compiler class at the university many years ago.  We used  
yacc/lex and the
famous Aho/Ullman dragon book.  I agree with a previous post, lexing/ 
parsing is
*hard* to do well.  Now I'm done with the theory, and I just want to  
get the job done.
IMHO, ANTLR is the next generation of yacc/lex, and is a great leap  
forward.  Many
thanks to Terence for encapsulating the concepts in code so well.   
Again, I'm done with
the theory, so if Terence were to proclaimed &quot;ASTs are good, you  
should always use
them&quot; I wouldn't argue, I'd just do it.

I disagree with the original posting - using ANTLR is far superior to  
hand-coding a
parser, which I've done.  I agree that the non-book documentation  
isn't great,  but the
simple solution is &quot;get the book&quot;.  Even with the book, questions  
like &quot;should I
use an AST or not&quot; make learning hard on newbies.  Some of us still  
haven't figured
that one out :-)

<PRE>Coming in rather late ...

We really want some sort of &quot;anti spamming&quot; system if we have a wiki.
There's a couple of simple solutions. As an example, go to
www.pickwiki.com. You need an admin password to edit pages, and there's
a great big hint staring you in the face when you go to signup/login.
Anybody who knows anything about Pick will guess the password in ten
seconds flat.

Just do something along the lines of &quot;Admin password? How does the
author of Antlr sign his emails&quot;. Or &quot;What's Antlr's author's surname&quot;.
Something that anybody who knows anything about Antlr should know
without needing to think.

Cheers,
Wol

Hi Jim,

We should start a Wiki, but for more of a FAQ-like creature.  For  
documentation, I'm going to write a book with draft chapters  
appearing as I write them.  Big examples etc...

A wiki we can start right away though.  Anybody want to recommend a  
simple to use, simple to install wiki, free, usable with apache?

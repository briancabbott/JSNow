<PRE>I changed my personal email address.
 
I don't know if you have &quot;monitoing&quot; turned on. If you log in at sourceforge
and go to the forum views, there's a &quot;monitor this forum&quot; link (or something
like that). Click on it and it'll send email to whatever email address you
registered w/ sourceforge.
 
I had an ancient email address in there, so I wasn't getting mail...

I'm glad you said something. I had my old email address registered @
sourceforge and wasn't getting notifications b/c of it...
 
As for an answer...
 
The plugin uses the standard eclipse update mechanism. All you need to do is
go to Eclipse's Help-&gt;Software Updates dialog, enter the update site name,
and work through the dialog.
 
I'm going to try to make it more obvious to do this through the sourceforge
page. If you go to the &quot;Home Page&quot; for the plugin from sourceforge, the
instructions specify to use the install tool.

I posted a message on the antlr plugin page on sourceforge, but that doesn't
seem to have too much activity.  I'm trying to get more info on the plugin.
It's not really clear what pieces I need in order to install it, especially
on Eclipse 3.1.  I'm already running antlr 2.7.5

Thanks, 
Peter

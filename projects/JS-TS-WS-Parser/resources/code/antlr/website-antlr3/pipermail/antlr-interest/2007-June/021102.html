<PRE>I think that this may well be co-incidence. The previous poster has
written a parser entirely as a lexer and that is why it is taking so
long to produce the output. As another poster said, if you take you one
or two the lexer fragment rules, then the lexer generation can breath
and it doesn't take so long. It looks to me like that is the issue with
the other grammar. 

While I cannot be certain, from what you said you were trying to do, I
think you were seeing a similar problem, with trying to make the lexer
too complicated and having non fragment lexer rules embedded in other
rules and so on. Hence you do not see these issue until you try to
generate the lexer. If ANTLRWorks were to try and find out if this would
happen, it would, guess what, have to pretty much generate the lexer.

If you are trying to specify things that look suspiciously like syntax
in the lexer, then you are doing it in the wrong place basically. Just
list all the thing s that can be tokenized, then tell the parser what is
and is not a valid order.

<PRE>One of the problems that we hoped that ANTLR 3 would solve was that of text output--generating text from ANTLR 2 was an unpleasant experience.  StringTemplate helps considerably, and one of the inchoate ideas that Ter was grappling with at the ANTLR 3 cabal was that of an &quot;output grammar&quot; that would provide a mapping between an ANTLR grammar and a template group.  This idea never quite gelled; the ANTLR 3 &quot;template&quot; output options was a first attempt to go in this direction.

Last week's &quot;template generation&quot; discussion came just as I was finishing a pretty printer for Yggdrasil and started me thinking about the problem again.  I finally came up an approach that seems to provide a solution and have implemented that in Yggdrasil.  After trying other syntaxes, I ended up with an annotation that &quot;mirrors&quot; the template syntax:  a &lt;foo&gt; suffix assigns a token's text to a &quot;foo&quot; attribute, while &lt;&lt;bar&gt;&gt; references a bar template (fills a slot that holds slots; i. e:  a template).  This approach could easily be incorporated into the baseline ANTLR 3; the whole idea of output grammars seems to be a big step forward.  I have documented this for Yggdrasil as follows:


Output annotations and automated template
generationIf the grammar
option &#8220;buildText&#8221; is set to true, Yggdrasil will automatically
output templates according to the model:
String
	templates are decorated as trees mirroring the input elements of the
	grammar.  For each rule in a grammar, there may be a corresponding
	string template definition, either explicitly specified or (by
	default) with the same name as the rule.  Upon entry to a rule, the
	current template value is pushed onto a stack.  If there is a
	template for the rule, then an instance of that template is created
	and current is set with that instance; otherwise, the current
	template remains in effect.
	Unless
	otherwise specified, values are added to the &#8220;body&#8221; attribute of
	the current template.
	Grammar
	annotations for template building generally take the form of &lt;key&gt;
	or &lt;&lt;template&gt;&gt; suffixes.  A rule defined with the name
	foo&lt;&lt;bar&gt;&gt; has &#8220;bar&#8221; as the rule template (the
	syntax here is limited to a single argument).  A rule, token, or
	instantiated attribute reference of the form tok&lt;t&gt; assigns
	tok to the t attribute.  &#8220;&lt;-&gt;&#8221; is the template equivalent
	of &#8220;!&#8221;.  Rule references have the additonal form
	ruleRef&lt;&lt;templateName&gt;&gt; or &lt;key&lt;templateName&gt;&gt;;
	templateName overrides the template that would have otherwise been
	invoked.  If templateName is &#8220;-&#8221;, then no template is created
	for the invoked rule and text items are added to the current
	template.  [So &#8220;&lt;-&gt;&#8221; is &#8220;do not add text&#8221; and &#8220;&lt;&lt;-&gt;&gt;&#8221;
	is &#8220;do not invoke a new template&#8221;.]
	Syntactic
	predicates build templates, and the recognizer class tracks the last
	syntactic predicate. Synpred templates are not added to the output
	template; they are tracked as an aid to debugging.
Within a rule,
&#8220;@$&lt;&gt;&#8221; references the active template and can be assigned
to a Text attribute.  Grammar attributes are not added to the output
template except through actions or through the attribute algebra.
Given this scheme,
any grammar can become an output grammar, and a variety of template
groups can be built in order to do such things as build text for
displaying a parse tree, build XML output, pretty print, and the
like.  Parse tree and XML output forms can be built automatically. 
To build a pretty printer or other customized output format, the
natural approach is to start with a parse tree format, then fill out
individual templates and annotate the grammar.  For a rule named
&#8220;rule&#8221;, one parse tree template is
rule(body) ::= &lt;&lt;
&#8220;rule&#8221;
	&lt;body;
separator = &#8220;\n&#8221;&gt;
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>and this template
can be easily generated for all rules in a grammar.
Example output grammarThis
is a simplified subset of some definitions from antlr.g:


rule&lt;&lt;ruleDef&gt;&gt;
	:
	(
		DOC_COMMENT
	)?
	(
		&quot;protected&quot;
		|
			&quot;public&quot;
		|
			&quot;private&quot;
		|
			&quot;fragment&quot;
	)?
	(
		RULE_REF&lt;name&gt;
		|
			TOKEN_REF&lt;name&gt;
	)
	COLON
	block
	SEMI
	;


block
	:
	alternative
	(
OR&lt;-&gt; alternative&lt;&lt;orAlt&gt;&gt; )*
	;


and
this is the corresponding template set for a pretty printer:


ruleDef(name,
body) ::= &lt;&lt;
&lt;name&gt;
	:
	&lt;body;
separator = &quot;\n&quot;&gt;
	;
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>

block(body,
suffix) ::= &lt;&lt;
(
	&lt;body;
separator = &quot;\n&quot;&gt;
)&lt;suffix&gt;
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>

alternative(body)
::<i>= &lt;&lt;
</I>&lt;body;
separator = &quot;\n&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>

orAlt(body)
::<i>= &lt;&lt;
</I>|<i>
</I>	&lt;body;
separator = &quot;\n&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>


Note that a fairly minimal annotation of the .g file maps the
input onto a rich template set; that is, the development effort for
producing a pretty printer is focused primarily on building
templates, not on annotating the grammar.

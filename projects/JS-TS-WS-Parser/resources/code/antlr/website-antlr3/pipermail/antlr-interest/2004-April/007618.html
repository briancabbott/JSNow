<PRE>Hi All,

I'm relatively new to all this language recognition stuff and have a 
question that I could really use a hand with. It's probably not that 
hard, it's more likely that i'm just missing something obvious.

The issue is that i'm trying to parse a language that allows 
unquoted strings to be passed as parameters to functions. There are 
no rules on what can go inside these unquoted string's - they can be 
the names of literals, functions or any random sequence of 
characters.

I've tried recognising a set of ID tokens (defined as per the java 
grammer specification) but this is no good as i've got 
testLiterals=true; so anything that is a literal comes through from 
the lexer as a specific token type and therefore doesn't match 
against ID.

Here is an example of the type of thing i'm trying to match:

PAGES,Sale detail,Status changes,Sale costs

The issue lies with the fact that each of the parameters are REALLY 
strings but in this bizzare language they don't have to be double 
quoted. The issue is further compounded by the fact that the word 
Status is really a function name and hence has a specific token type.

Here is a snippet of the grammer i've done so far to deal with 
this:

designerCommand
//Commands to the designer
	:	&quot;SIZE&quot; COMMA NUM_INT COMMA NUM_INT
	|	&quot;PAGES&quot; COMMA textParameter (COMMA textParameter)*
	;

textParameter
	:	(ID)*
	| 	STRING_LITERAL
	;

Please let me know if you can provide any advise at all or even 
point me to a relevant article somewhere.

Many thanks in advance,

Craig

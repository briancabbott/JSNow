<PRE>Hi guys,

I'm working on analyzing java source code and doing some sort of java 
code translation by using antlr java parser. I'm using antlr 2.7.1 
and Java 1.3 Recognizer.

First problem:
The problem is how to regenerate source code from AST which antlr 
java parser generated. I only know one solution which is to use 
TokenStreamHiddenTokenFilter to preserve whitespace and comments, 
then walk AST to regenerate sourcecode. Is there another(better) way 
to do that?

Second Problem:
Based on antlr document - Token Streams and preserveWhiteSpace 
example, I have modified java.g and java.tree.g files in order to use 
TokenStreamHiddenTokenFilter. 
every thing works well except some rule involved with BuildinType. I 
use following example to test. Most statements work well such as 
package, import, class and method definition... I do get comment and 
whitespace. but I couldn't get hidden token for variable definition 
statements(in the example I marked them with --- dosen't work). for 
instance:
  int   b; //comment
I got such result
  intb; //comment
for buildintype in the VARIABLE_DEF rule such int, shor, float and 
boolean ..., I couldn't get hidden tokens. 

strange thing is that it works for method definition which include 
variable difinition in the parameter list. For example:
  int  foo(int i, int j)   
for this line I can get blanks both for return type and parameter 
type. 

So in one work, preserving blank and comment dosen't work only for 
buildin type in the VARIABLE_DEF rule. 

I have tried several time, even tried on antlr2.7.2, but I can't find 
solution.

I don't know I have explained the problem clearly or not. If you 
need, I can't send you my test case, java.g and java.tree.g.

thanks a lot.


Test Case:
package org.antlr.tools; // 	comment packege
// comment before import
import java.swing.*; // comment import

public class Test { //class Test
 int   b; //comment            --- dosen't work

 int  foo(int i, int j) {
   int z = 1;                 --- dosen't work
   float f = 0.001;           --- dosen't work
   i = z + 1;			
   String s = (String) &quot;ff&quot;;  --- dosen't work
 }
	
 public static void main(String[] args) {
   String[] a = new String[10];	--- dosen't work
   Test obj = new Test();			
   obj.foo(1,2);
 }
}

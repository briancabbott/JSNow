 &gt;rule tagInnerValues has non-LL(*) decision due to recursive rule
 &gt;invocations reachable from alts 1,2,3.  Resolve by 
left-factoring
 &gt;or using syntactic predicates or using backtrack=true option
 &gt;
 &gt;But, I'm confused in that, I have a syntactic predicate - either
 &gt;tagAttributes OR script are going to be required, never both - 
so
 &gt;why am I getting the warning? I would have thought the code 
above
 &gt;would have got rid of it.

Actually that's a *semantic* predicate, not a syntactic one, since 
it uses target code rather than tokens to resolve itself (hence 
the braces).  (Technically it's a *gated* semantic predicate, but 
I can never remember how those are different from regular semantic 
predicates.)

Also, the fact that it's mentioning alt 3 (which is empty) leads 
me to suspect that the problem actually lies further up the 
tree.  You've probably got a &quot;list of nothing&quot;-type construct, 
which makes no sense and causes odd things to happen.

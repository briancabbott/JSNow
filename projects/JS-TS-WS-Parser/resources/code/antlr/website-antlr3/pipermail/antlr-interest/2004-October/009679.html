Given developers with the same level of proficiency and experience
with C++ and Java, most will be able to produce an application like
ANTLR much more quickly and easily with Java than C++. There are of
course some applications where the need to optimize memory usage
and/or speed aggressively suggest C++ (or perhaps C or assembly
language) might be a better choice.

&gt;<i> Whether the ANTLR development effort over the years would be been less
</I>&gt;<i> productive if C++ was used is questionable.
</I>
Not at all. Ensuring it compiled correctly on a variety of C++
compilers across many OS platforms would have been a job in itself.

&gt;<i> True that it would be impractical to post binaries for all
</I>platforms, but
&gt;<i> given the nature of ANTLR, I would assume that most people interested in
</I>&gt;<i> such a tool would have access to a C++ compiler.  It's not uncommon
</I>on most
&gt;<i> platforms to build your own tools from source code.
</I>
ANTLR users all have access to gcc I suppose but, that is far from
saying they are C++ developers and can fix any issues that arise while
attempting a build. Many are Java or C# developers and may be quite
unused to compiling C++ projects. Lex/Yacc certainly don't require
this level of familiarity.

&gt;<i> &gt; Incidentally, the DFA-as-bytecode generation issue isn't a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; runtime limitation, it is a *language* limitation
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, and that's the reason I raised the issue.  Whenever you have to
</I>resort
&gt;<i> to a hack in order to work around a fundamental language limitation,
</I>that
&gt;<i> (IMO) calls into question whether the right language is being used
</I>for the
&gt;<i> job.
</I>
Perhaps. In this case my understanding is that Ter can already
generate Java code for the generated DFAs. He is now trying to
optimize the DFA generation/representation for Java targets. IOW, this
isn't an issue about the ANTLR tool itself. DFA generation for C++, C#
and other targets aren't affected and would presumably use those
language's features (including any required hacks to make them
similarly efficient).

&gt;<i> It seems curious that Java has a goto in its runtime but no way to
</I>&gt;<i> express that in the language.
</I>
I seem to remember it has something to do with Java's secure mobile
code aspirations.

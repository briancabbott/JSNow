It's a tool.  There's no reason the user should have to care what language
it's implemented in simply in order to use it.  Gcc is written in C, but I
don't care about that when I use it to compile C++, Fortran, or Java code.
I don't actually know what languages Flex or Bison are written in (though I
of course have a pretty good idea), but that doesn't in the least prevent me
from invoking them like this:

	$ flex [whatever]
	$ bison [whatever]

Is there a reason why I shouldn't be able to do the equivalent with ANTLR?

&gt;<i> so make install only works for 
</I>&gt;<i> the C runtime distribution (after a ./configure).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Right, but I'm talking about the ANTLR tool itself, not any of its
language-specific runtimes.

&gt;<i> The ANTLR source can be bult from scratch now using maven though:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) In stall Maven 2.0.9 or better;
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Find the directories with pom.xml in them
</I>&gt;<i> 3) cd to them and type: mvn
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Look at the output of the build to see where the .jar 
</I>&gt;<i> files go if are not familiar with Maven.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I'm less concerned with the building of it than the installation and use of
it.  Can I do this?:

	$ cd antlr-src-distro-dir/
	$ mvn install
	$ antlr [whatever]

Like I said, it's the 20th century.  I, as the user, shouldn't have to be
&quot;looking at the output&quot; of anything, picking out the &quot;artifacts&quot; (as the
kids call 'em these days), worrying about where they should go, and then
have to move them manually.  As you indicated above, I don't have to with
the C runtime, why should I have to for the tool itself?

&gt;<i> Note that the Maven build, as well as constructing the ANTLR 
</I>&gt;<i> .jar file also creates a complete executable (I.e Java -jar) 
</I>&gt;<i> jar file that includes all the dependencies  to make things 
</I>&gt;<i> easier for developers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Ok, so can't it go the last mile and also create a simple shell script
wrapper so I can:

	$ antlr MyGrammar.g

?  In fact, rumor has it that the Maven tool of which you speak uses exactly
that approach itself.

To answer my own question, I broke out my autotools- and script-fu last
night and rolled an automake+autoconf+built-shell-script which does in fact
allow me to:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install
	$ antlr
	ANTLR Parser Generator  Version 3.1.1
	[etc etc]

The JARs aren't actually built, but rather the pre-built one in the source
distro's /lib directory is installed, and the &quot;antlr&quot; shell script is
generated from a template (a default Java interpreter and the path to the
JAR are substituted).  &quot;make install&quot; puts everything in reasonable places
and, Bob's your uncle, everything works just as it should.

Terence (or anybody), any interest in this?  I could certainly BSD-license
it and contribute it.

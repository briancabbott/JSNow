<PRE>Hi,

For quite some time I have working on this home project trying to parse a very complex grammar.  I had a brain wave yesterday on how to skip the difficult bits, at least for the moment. If I were to handle the difficult bits now, I would end up producing a parser for a complete programming language, almost.  Below is an example of the sort of thing I am trying to skip - i.e. the 'where' statement.  Now, because the grammar is such that the 'where' statement, or statements, immediately precede the 'end_type' keyword, I thought I'd gobble to 'end_type'.

In the example below, at the moment, 'typeid' and 'underlyingtype' eventually come down to a simple string identifier of 'a..z'('a-z'|'_')*

type dayinmonth = integer;
&#160;where
&#160;&#160;&#160; validrange : {1 &lt;= self &lt;= 31};
end_type;
&#160; 
The modified grammar for this is...

typedecl
&#160;&#160;&#160; : 'type' typeid '=' underlyingtype ';' (options {greedy=false;} : .* ) 'end_type' ';'
&#160;&#160;&#160; ;

I can't just skip to the next ';' because there may be several statements i.e.

Where
   Label1 : stuff1;
   Label2: stuff2;

What I find is that the '{' and '}' within the gobble process become significant.  In other similar cases I find a '|', or even a carriage return '\r', is significant.  Using the Eclipse add-in, testing just this sub-graph produces different (although successful in both cases) results depending on whether the '{' or '}' is surrounded by whitespace or not.  Somehow, if it is surrounded by whitespace, the '{' token disappears from the parse tree.  But when trying to parse the text properly in context, it throws up an error.  I also found that changing the '{' to '(' removed the error.

In the end, I managed to parse an 12000 line file with only this type of error.

This was a long introduction for just a couple of short questions.  Are there significant characters that can affect the gobble process?  Do I need other options to be able to skip everything to 'end_type'?

Thanks.

Dugald Wilson

<PRE>It depends what you mean by &quot;ambiguous&quot;.
I assume you mean for some given k lookahead the grammar is not &quot;ambiguous&quot;.
But you still have to decide what value of k you need and this may change as
your grammar evolves.

Ideally I would like a language that is not &quot;ambiguous&quot; with a lookahead of
1 token.  However as I designed the language for ease of use by the user
(rather then the parser) I found this was not possible.

I think the Antlr's  (   )=&gt; solution is very good.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'm working on my first ANTLR grammar, and I keep getting bitten by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the fact that ANTLR uses linear approximation of LL(k).  I'm wondering
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; if there are any general strategies for avoiding or working around
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; this problem.  Can predicates be used?
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; statement: (IDENTIFIER IDENTIFIER)=&gt;variableDecl | expression;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course!  I was trying to put the predicate on variableDecl instead
</I>&gt;<i> of statement.  Sorry, I should have figured that one out on my own.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; On a related note, I'm designing both the syntax of this language and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the parser together, using ANTLR along the way to catch problems in my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; syntax.  However, I feel like I spend as much time trying to figure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; out why ANTLR doesn't like a rule as I do developing the syntax
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; itself.  I never know if an error message from ANTLR is because my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; syntax is bad or because I'm just not representing it in a way that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ANTLR likes.  Might there be a better tool for developing the grammar
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; independent of the parser?  (I want to make sure I have a regular
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; grammar, which can be parsed without referencing any semantic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; information such as symbol tables, so the tool should be able to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; validate this.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you look at the generated code, it's usually pretty easy to figure
</I>out
&gt;<i> &gt; what antlr is trying to do.  What other problems have been on the antlr
</I>side
&gt;<i> &gt; instead of the bad syntax side?  I'm not familiar enough with other
</I>tools to
&gt;<i> &gt; recommend any alternatives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As another example, here's one of the things I ran into early on that
</I>&gt;<i> confused me.  It was a case of '(A|B)|C' being different from
</I>&gt;<i> 'A|B|C'.  The following testcase is an extreme simplification of the
</I>&gt;<i> grammar I originally wrote that caused the problem:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   test: (ID | paren) | ID paren;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   paren: &quot;(&quot; test &quot;)&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As such, there is a nondeterminism on 'test'.  Remove the grouping
</I>&gt;<i> parenthesis, and it works just fine.  This was very non-intuitive to
</I>&gt;<i> me, and took many hours to track down.  (The situation was
</I>&gt;<i> considerably more complex in real life, but this is what I eventually
</I>&gt;<i> narrowed it down to.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not knocking ANTLR at all; I think it's a wonderful system.  As I
</I>&gt;<i> get used to the way it works, I'm having fewer and fewer problems.
</I>&gt;<i> But what I ideally want in this stage of language design is to simply
</I>&gt;<i> write straight EBNF (no predicates), and have something to analyze it
</I>&gt;<i> and tell me if the grammar is ambiguous or not.  Once I'm sure I've
</I>&gt;<i> got a good grammar, then I can worry about how to parse it.  Doing
</I>&gt;<i> both at once is a little inconvenient.  (Not to mention that having
</I>&gt;<i> redundant information, like the predicate above that solves my
</I>&gt;<i> problem, clutters up the grammar, making it harder to read.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the help.

<PRE>A couple of other things though on this now I think about it.

 

1)      To avoid problems with various systems ideas about what wide_t is, character strings are encoded in their ASCII hex forms &#8211; this would have to be avoided by encoding &#8216;C&#8217; &#8216;h&#8217; &#8216;a&#8217; &#8216;r&#8217;

2)      Use &#8216;\n&#8217; etc rather than unicode code points in your rules;

3)      Use 3.2 and ensure that you get switches generated for everything and not DFA tables;

 

I cannot immediately think of anything else that would get in the way. However, if you hack together anything then send me the changes you had to make as if they are reasonable then I am willing to add them to the C target J If the main thing is the encoding in ASCII form of string literals then it might be reasonable to add an ebcdic option to the command line and only those targets where it is an issue would look at it. I just don&#8217;t want to embark on huge changes just to accommodate IBM.

 

I am not sure how true it is or not, but a friend of mine worked for IBM in Florida and met a guy who was (or at least said he was) on the development committee for EBCDIC. He claimed that he had deliberately thrown in outrageous suggestions (but I don&#8217;t know if it was out of disgust or a bizarre sense of humor), and that some of them were adopted. 

 

Anyway, you have my sympathies trying to work on the C stuff on zOS. I was pioneer on using it and I can only hope that it is more mature these days. If I can help you, then I will J

Jim, thanks for your response ...

I know that in the EBCDIC system we feed a Unicode stream into the lexer, thus I'm pretty sure when the generated lexer code I pasted before is executed, it is already operating on the 32-bit unicode stream.

The problem is more about the native C compilation in an EBCDIC system like IBM z/OS mainframe.

To see if a character from the Unicode stream is an 'A', we have to compare with a value 0x0041 ... If we match it with a native 'A' in the code, this will not be a match in an EBCDIC C compilation.

Best,
-Lego

ANTLR works internally with 32 bit Unicode (UTF32), not EBCDIC, even if it is in 8 bit mode. So you need to convert the EBCDIC to Unicode 8 bits and use the &#8216;ASCII&#8217; input stream. A simple way to do this would be to write your own EBCDIC input stream that just converted to Unicode code points (essentially EBCDIC-&gt;ASCII) on the fly via a lookup table. Trivial and should be pretty quick.

Subject: [antlr-interest] ANTLR C: Question regarding the portability of generated lexer C code

 

I just recently noticed that the generated code from my lexer grammar contains something like the following snippet:

            .
            .
            else if ( (((LA17_0 &gt;= 'A') &amp;&amp; (LA17_0 &lt;= 'Z'))) ) 
            {
                alt17=2;
            }
            else if ( (((LA17_0 &gt;= 'a') &amp;&amp; (LA17_0 &lt;= 'z'))) ) 
            {
                alt17=3;
            }
            else if ( (((LA17_0 &gt;= 0x00A0) &amp;&amp; (LA17_0 &lt;= 0xD7FF))) ) 
            {
                alt17=4;
            }
            .
            .

The generated code seems to comfortably use 'A' ... 'Z' literals.  This may not be good if let's say I compile the generated code in an IBM z/OS EBCDIC environment as ['A' .. 'Z'] range contains more than just the 26 alphabet codes and the value of the codes are not the same as the ones in Unicode character set.

I'm expecting something like in the third expression where 'A' is written explicitly as 0x0041 (Unicode for 'A').

Please confirm.

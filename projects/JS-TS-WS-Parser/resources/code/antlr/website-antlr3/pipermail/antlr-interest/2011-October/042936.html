<PRE>Hi,
After getting quite excited reading through the first few chapters of Language Implementation Patterns&quot;, I decided it was worth an investment of time on my part.
So I've been fighting my way through getting the latest version of Antlr working with Visual Studio 2010. I'm having all sorts of problems, such as configuration and tutorial documentation being spread all over the place and with various vintages. Nonetheless, I've finally managed to get a simple grammar working using the instructions here:
www.antlr.org/depot/antlrcs/.../ANTLRCSharpDocumentation.docx&lt;<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/depot/antlrcs/.../ANTLRCSharpDocumentation.docx">http://www.antlr.org/depot/antlrcs/.../ANTLRCSharpDocumentation.docx</A>&gt;
However, when I tried something a little more involved (still very simple), using the treeparser example code for target Csharp2 (god only knows where I found that, I can't seem to retrace my steps).
First I got an error that was eliminated when I commented out the use of HIDDEN:
WS : (' '|'\n') /*{$channel=HIDDEN;}*/ ;
Now I'm getting an error caused by Console.Out.WriteLine, presumably because the generated code does not contain a &quot;using&quot; reference to System, and I don't know how to put that in a grammar file.
decl : ^(DECL type declarator)
       // label.start, label.start, label.text
       {Console.Out.WriteLine(&quot;int &quot;+$declarator.text);}
     ;
How normal are these sorts of startup problems? Are the examples generally not working in this way? And how much will it help to get the Definitive Guide To ANTLR? Will ANTLRworks flag problems like this, which are presumably specific to the C#/.NET platform?
And while I'm at it, once I'm done with this, will I easily be able to get ANTLR to put line and column numbers from my source files into the nodes in ASTs that I build? That's important to me.
THANKS FOR ANY HELP!

-          Andy

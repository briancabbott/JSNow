<PRE>Hi Jim,

Java V1.5 has almost caught up with my Thread improvements but not quite (see 
<A HREF="http://www.forward.com.au/javaProgramming/futureTalker.html">http://www.forward.com.au/javaProgramming/futureTalker.html</A> for details)

My article <A HREF="http://www.forward.com.au/javaProgramming/threadReturnsPackage/ToCatchAThread.html">http://www.forward.com.au/javaProgramming/threadReturnsPackage/ToCatchAThread.html</A>
details the problem with Java threads.  It is not just the design of Swing that gives the problems.

  Yes, I am not a Java basher, but surely you should not need to develop such a thing. This is more a reflection of Swing and the way it does things than Java itself of course.

  Hi Jim, 

  Java is not that slow, it only appears to be if the GUI trys to do all the work on the main thread.

  Liberal use of background threadsimproves the user's perception of speed.

  That's why I developed my Threadspackage

    My only fear (hoping not to start a religious war) is that graphical tools built in Java always seem to crash, hang, have slow GUIs and so on (at least on windows, and though it would be easy to blame Windows, I don't think that is the issue). At the moment this tool suffers form the same issues - though I am loathe to offer any judgment at this stage in the game - I would prefer to contribute to its betterment.

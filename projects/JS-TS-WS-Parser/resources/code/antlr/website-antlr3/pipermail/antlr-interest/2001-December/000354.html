<PRE>Version 2.1 of ANTLR-mode has been uploaded.

   <A HREF="http://www.fmi.uni-passau.de/~wedler/antlr-mode/">http://www.fmi.uni-passau.de/~wedler/antlr-mode/</A>

ANTLR is a tool for LL(k)-based language recognition.  This Emacs
extension provides various features for the development of ANTLR grammar
files, see below.

v1.4a of this mode is distributed with Emacs-21.1.
v1.0/beta of this mode is distributed with ANTLR-2.7.1.
   (Ter, I hope it's not too late to get v2.1 into ANTLR-2.7.2...)

Thanks to the people having sent patches &amp; suggestions, see the
ChangeLog file.


New in ANTLR-mode 2.1:

 * New command+menus to insert/change file/grammar/rule/subrule options.

 * More sophisticated indentation: electric keys, cpp directive,
   narrowing.
   
 * Previous versions would not work with cc-mode-5.28+ (already in
   v1.4a, i.e., the version distributed with Emacs-21.1).

 * Syntax highlighting changes.  Miscellaneous.


Features of ANTLR-mode:

 * CONSISTENT INDENTATION. You do not have to insert or delete the
   correct amount of spaces or tabs manually to indent a line according
   to ANTLR's coding style: just press TAB. It is even done
   automatically if you insert an ANTLR syntax symbol (one of
   &quot;:;|&amp;(){}&quot;). Use the menu to indent all lines in a selected region.

 * SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING. When enabled, this mode highlights grammar
   symbols (syntax symbols and keywords: bold black, rule references:
   dark blue, token references: dark orange, rule/token definition: bold
   blue) and the code in actions (respecting the value of ANTLR's
   language option).

 * CODE BROWSING. Find the definition of a rule, token, or grammar class
   by using the Index menu, a keyboard command or selecting an entry in
   the speedbar frame.

 * FAST NAVIGATION. Move to the next or previous rule definition or to
   the beginning or end of the rule body by one or two key strokes.
   
 * ACTION VISIBILITY. Control the visibility of less important code like
   actions.

 * OPTION SUPPORT. Insert or change one of ANTLR's options by a using
   the menu or a keyboard command. This mode knows the options supported
   by ANTLR, their allowed values and the correct position where to
   insert the option (and the surrounding options{} if necessary).

 * TOOL INVOCATION. Run ANTLR from within Emacs and find the error
   position by selecting the error message via the mouse or a keyboard
   command.

 * MAKEFILE CREATION. Show the makefile dependencies for all grammar and
   generated files in the current directory. For it, this mode considers
   the value of ANTLR's language option, import/export vocabularies and
   grammar inheritance.

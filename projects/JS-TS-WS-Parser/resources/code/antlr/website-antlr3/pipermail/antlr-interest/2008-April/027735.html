<PRE>I'm testing every rule in the parser individual and this all worked great 
until I started adding a dynamic scopes to build up a symbol table.  The 
problem I have now is that since these scopes are not initialized some of 
the individual rule calls through an EmptyStack exception in my unit 
tests.  I've ignored the problem for now with a nasty line in the grammar 
which checks if the a specific scope it empty before it uses a scope. 
Ideally I'll like a way to inject data into scopes for unit testing.  I 
was wondering how other people have got around this.

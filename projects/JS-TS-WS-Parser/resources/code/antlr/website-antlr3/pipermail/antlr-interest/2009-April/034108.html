When you compiled your grammar on the command line, did you 
include the -debug switch?  (Or could it have picked up stray 
.java or .class files that had been generated using that switch?)

Because using -debug makes ANTLR quite intentionally &quot;lock up&quot; 
immediately on startup -- it's waiting for a socket connection 
from ANTLRWorks' Debug Remote feature.

(Other likely causes of lockups: you have a top-level lexer rule 
that can successfully match zero characters, most often the result 
of using * when you meant +.  Don't do that.)

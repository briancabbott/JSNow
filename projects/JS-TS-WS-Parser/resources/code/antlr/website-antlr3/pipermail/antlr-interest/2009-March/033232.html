</I>Presumably in ANTLR 2.7 you used the literals table, ANTLR 3 handles
the keyword identifier distinction through it's nifty DFAs,
unfortunately with such a large number of keywords the DFA needed gets
pretty complicated, especially if you have a number of other rules
which allow subsets of your keyword vocabulary.
You can duplicate the 2.7 behaviour by having an action in your
identifier rule test a hashtable. Something like:
tokens {
  KEYWORDA;
  KEYWORDB;
}

@lexer::members {
  private Hashtable&lt;String,Integer&gt; literalsTable = new Hashtable() {{
    put(&quot;keyworda&quot;, KEYWORDA);
    put(&quot;keywordb&quot;, KEYWORDB);
  }};

  private int checkLiterals(String text) {
    Integer type = literalsTable.get(text);
    if(type != null)
      return type;
    else
      return ID;
  }
}
ID: 'a'..'z' { $type=checkLiterals($text); };

Though there was a bug that caused warning when the tokens section was
used for like that so you may need to instead have fragment rules to
define the token types (the content is irrelevant though I don't think
they can be empty).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like advertised in the ANTLR book, I also used semantic predicates to
</I>&gt;<i> locally check if an identifier is actually the keyword I want. This did
</I>&gt;<i> not work out: the language is very verbose and most sentences look like
</I>&gt;<i> native english, so the parser then sees : ID ID ID ID and it has to
</I>&gt;<i> check 800 semantic predicates in order to find out which keyword comes
</I>&gt;<i> next. Having only one token (ID) might have been to extreme, and having
</I>&gt;<i> different groups seems indeed interesting, although probably tedious.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Ouch, it seems surprising that the language is so complex that it
actually allows a major subset of your 800 keywords at any one point.
Generally context should vastly reduce the number of checks needed.

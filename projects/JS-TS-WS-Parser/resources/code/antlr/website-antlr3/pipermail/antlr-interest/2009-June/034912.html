Hi Stephen,

(Excellent spelling of your name, by the way.)

ANTLR is indeed a great foundation for a language translator.  As for how to do it, check out Terrence's books.

* <A HREF="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr/the-definitive-antlr-reference">http://www.pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr/the-definitive-antlr-reference</A>  This is how to use ANTLR at the nitty-gritty level.

* <A HREF="http://www.pragprog.com/news/language-design-patterns-the-seed-of-hope">http://www.pragprog.com/news/language-design-patterns-the-seed-of-hope</A>  This is a book of design patterns that will, frankly, get you right where you need to be.  (When it's finished, actually.  It's in beta now, but is VERY readable.)

Have fun!  This is a great tool and a great community.

--Stephen

I am new to ANTLR, and therefore I do not know the full capabilities, or all the appropriate applications and would appreciate any guidance on the following.  I am currently working in the interactive television application space. One technology that I am currently using is the Yahoo Widget Platform (<A HREF="http://connectedtv.yahoo.com/">http://connectedtv.yahoo.com/</A>).  All user interface screens and components are laid out and created using JavaScript.  For example, to add a button to a screen, JavaScript would be used to instantiate a button object, setting various attributes (such as location, etc) and then append to a DOM object.  This is all fine and good, but what I would like to do is build a declarative language, similar to the JavaFX JSON style (or XML style language), to lay out these JavaScript components, and then translate the JSON/XML statements into the final JavaScript code which will be deployed on the end users set top box or TV.

My main question is, is ANTLR the appropriate tool for building of a declarative style language and the translation of the language to a final JavaScript output?  If so, is there any documentation regarding using ANTLR for a situation like what I am trying to accomplish?  I appreciate any help.

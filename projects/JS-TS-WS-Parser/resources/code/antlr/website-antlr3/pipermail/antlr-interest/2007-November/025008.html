                     Submission deadline: December 07, 2007
                     --------------------------------------


The first OMG sponsored &#8220;UML &amp; AADL&#8220; workshop was held at ENST Paris
(Telecom Paris) in 2006. The workshop was focused on embedded real-time
software-intensive systems that are usually found in the avionic,
vehicular control and aerospace fields.
The workshop clearly had a main concern which was to determine what
architectural levels would be better described with UML as opposed to AADL
and vice versa, how to use these two standardised languages together
(integrating them using an MDA approach, e.g.: TOPCASED).

The second edition of the workshop, &#8220;UML&amp;AADL&#8217;2007&#8221; was held in
conjunction with the 12th International Conference on Engineering of
Complex Computer Systems (ICECS07). The AADL standard had just been
completed with a behaviour annex proposal and the MARTE UML profile was
about to be accepted. Thus, the main concerns of the second edition of the
workshop were centred around which parts of the MARTE UML profile could be
incorporated into an AADL PSM (Platform Specific Model) without overly
complicating the language, how to maintain the non-functional properties
and aspects of the design throughout the whole software engineering
process and how to specify functional and non-functional properties of
AADL components.

The third edition of the workshop, &#8220;UML&amp;AADL&#8217;2008&#8221;  will again be held
with the ICECCS conference since many concerns are found to be common
and/or complementary. The proposed topics of the workshop are revolve
around the architecture modeling of complex systems. This year, the main
concerns are:
   &#8226; How to handle code generation from a high-level specification
   &#8226; How to ensure architecture model verification
   &#8226; How to model DRE (Distributed Real-time Embedded) systems with an MDA
     approach
   &#8226; How to carry out scheduling analysis from system models

Topics:
======

New real-time systems have increasingly complex architectures because of
the intricacy of the multiple interdependent features they have to manage.
They must meet new requirements of reusability, interoperability,
flexibility and portability. These new dimensions favour the use of an
architecture description language that offers a global vision of the
system, and which is particularly suitable for handling real-time
characteristics.

Due to the even more increased complexity of distributed, real-time and
embedded systems (DRE), the need for a model-driven approach is more
obvious in this domain than in monolithic RT systems. The purpose of this
workshop is to provide an opportunity to gather researchers and industrial
practitioners to survey existing efforts related to behaviour modelling
and model-based analysis of DRE systems.

This workshop seeks contributions from researchers and practitioners
interested in all aspects of the representation, analysis, and
implementation of DRE system behaviour and/or architecture models. To this
end, we solicit short papers (~6 pages long) as well as full papers (not
more than 20 pages) related to, but not limited to, the following
principal topics:

    &#8226; Code generation from UML (action language) or an ADL (for instance,
      building a runtime corresponding to what is specified in an ADL
      description, code patterns) towards multiple target languages.
      Presentation of code genaration frameworks, tool suites or
      component-based programming  will be particularly appreciated
    &#8226; Model verification to verify functional properties against
      constraints
      given in the architecture model
    &#8226; Verification of non-functional properties given in the architecture
       model against constraints given in the model
    &#8226; Modelling DRE systems with languages such as UML and/or AADL, ACME,
      Wright, or other ADLs
         o Behaviour modelling (concerns described in the Scope part)
         o How to enhance modelling languages and ADLs to capture real
           time,
           embedded and distributed aspects in a convenient manner
         o How to specify real-time requirements and characteristics in
           modelling languages

Workshop Format
===============
This full-day workshop will consist of an introduction of the topic by the
workshop organizers, presentations of accepted papers, and in depth
discussion of previously identified subjects emerging from the
submissions. A summary of the discussions will be made available.

Submission and Publication
==========================
To contribute, please send a position paper or a technical paper to
agusti[dot]canals[at]c-s[dot]fr with &#8220;ICECCS08 UML&amp;AADL Workshop&#8221; in the
title. Papers should not exceed 6 pages. Submitted manuscripts should be
in English and formatted in the style of the IEEE Computer Society
Proceedings Format. Preferably, submissions should be in PDF format.

Workshop proceedings will be distributed to all participants and made
available through the workshop website.

The seven best papers and a workshop overview will
be published in the IEEE Computer Society Press Proceedings.

Additionally, all selected papers will be availables in an &#8220;IEEE Xplore
Digital Library File Cabinet&#8221;.

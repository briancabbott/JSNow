Yes, and you can recognize it with a wildcard (.) to shortcut the 
parsing.  This is a first cut at optimizing AST generation.  The next 
is to disallow tree construction in actions (construct trees &quot;only&quot; at 
the grammar level) so that a list of AST nodes to be allocated and 
tree structuring ops so that only nodes used in the constructed tree 
are allocated--that will have to wait for 3.0.

&gt;<i> there might be a way to specialize your tree grammar generator into

Yes, but only in passing.  Ter has some ideas (some incomplete, and 
some implemented in the jGuru site) on code generation, and I think 
that they need to be implemented before we (the community) tackle 3.0 
just to make it easy.  Bug him for the details.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;	#( A B )
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rather than the A B list that might have been expected.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmmm, I'm not sure I would expect the list.  But I guess if I wanted 
</I>the
&gt;<i> tree I would do #( ROOT! A^ B), right?  I can see that the inverse 
</I>(assuming
&gt;<i> a tree) could be problematic.
</I>
Right--you need some way to flatten the tree.  In fact,
     #( r:ROOT! #{ r } A B )
does a conversion of tree to list.

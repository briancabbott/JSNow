<PRE>Are there ways to attach a parser to a channel other than default?

I'm working on a grammar that has need of a javaoc-like facilities, and a 
C#-style preprocessor (i.e. very simple #if's and #defines); and if channels 
actually do anything right now, I'm pretty certain I could make use of it. 
Currently, I'm pushing token text for (&quot;#'  (~LF)* LF ) out to a secondary 
parser. But I can't help feeling that there's a better way to do this.

(Absolutely loving ANTLR 3, btw. After all the grim alternatives -- LL(k), 
LALR(1) and/or hopelessly license-encumbered -- ANTLR v3 is a marvelous 
change. In my opinion, the release of ANTLR v3 is  one of the great 
landmarks in the recent history of software development. Very exciting! 
Congratulations on your release.).

&gt;<i> Hi. :)  token channels are a way to avoid discarding tokens (still  send 
</I>&gt;<i> tokens to the parser) w/o having the parser see them.  So, you  could send 
</I>&gt;<i> whitespace on one channel, javadoc on another, and the  java tokens on the 
</I>&gt;<i> default channel.  Then actions can access the  hidden channels for 
</I>&gt;<i> translation.

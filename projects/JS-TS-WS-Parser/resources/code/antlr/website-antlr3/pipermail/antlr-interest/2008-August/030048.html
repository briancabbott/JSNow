Exactly correct.  Except ... almost all of the machinery needed to 
implement &quot;doSomething()&quot; as an operation on an AST already exists in Antlr!

Most any &quot;doSomething()&quot; can be composed from a well-defined API set 
of AST node-oriented operations, such as create, copy, insert, 
delete, and find.

Some if not most of  the needed atomic AST operations already exist 
in the org.antlr.runtime.tree.TreeWizard hierarchy (create(Token), 
dupNode(Object), dupTree(Object), index, getParent, setParent, 
getChild, setChild, addChild, replaceChildren, etc).

What is missing is a code generation step that would generate the 
bodies of the create, copy, insert, delete, and find methods specific 
to a particular AST node structure.  This is basically the same 
operation used in the generation of a tree-walker.

Tree-walker code is generated using ASTTreeParser.stg using a custom 
tree grammar to define static AST rewrites.  The implementing code 
for AST node create, copy, insert, delete, and find methods would be 
generated based on an analogous &quot;access grammar&quot; and corresponding 
ASTAccessParser.stg.  As with the tree grammar, the access grammar 
would identify the nodes of interest and their relevant structure.

Even with so much existing, this is not a trivial extension to 
Antlr.  Theoretically, the end result of any &quot;doSomething()&quot; AST 
manipulation could be done with a well-planned set of 
tree-walkers.  It is just that a random access approach, supported by 
the equivalent of findFirst, findNext, findPrev, findLast operations, 
is distinctly better than a purely top-down (only getNext allowed) 
approach for non-trivial bi-directionally context-dependent AST 
rewrite problems.

Unfortunately, does not sound like AntlrMorph addresses this 
particular problem.

Ter, do you have another graduate student looking for a project?  Or, 
if I finish my implementation, can I get Ph.D. credits? ;)

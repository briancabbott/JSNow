<PRE>Hello,

&gt;&gt;<i> Now I had downloaded from fisheye, to the same result. This is no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> surprise, since in both cases external_declaration goes to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> function_definition without going through declaration, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> function_definition in turn calls declarator and direct_declarator,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while they require declaration to be on stack...
</I>
&gt;<i> Hmm, that does sound like a problem with the grammar construction
</I>&gt;<i> if there is a path through the rules that does not cause a scope to be
</I>&gt;<i> stacked for the symbol table. Can you provide either your sample input
</I>&gt;<i> or a small example, or confirm that you are using the default supplied
</I>&gt;<i> input? Of course the example grammars are not meant to be rigorous
</I>&gt;<i> examples of a parser for the language, more examples of how to use
</I>&gt;<i> rules and so on, but they should not crash, at least not with the
</I>&gt;<i> sample input. I will try the examples on Linux and make sure it isn't
</I>&gt;<i> just something stupid here.
</I>
Yeah, it is a problem in grammar for me. I was testing on default input
provided with the example. You can find exact path in my original gdb
output, code went through this path:

#0 0x08054f75 in direct_declarator (ctx=0x80b0868) at CParser.c:16284
#1 0x08055897 in declarator (ctx=0x80b0868) at CParser.c:16156
#2 0x0806efa4 in function_definition (ctx=0x80b0868) at CParser.c:13775
#3 0x0806f5c3 in external_declaration (ctx=0x80b0868) at CParser.c:13652
#4 0x0806f89e in translation_unit (ctx=0x80b0868) at CParser.c:13543
#5 0x0806fbef in main (argc=1, argv=0xbf9b45a4) at main.c:188

I am really puzzled how it worked at least once - probably on non-linux
platform (or just different compiler) program was faulty but did not
crashed.

I have also described how to fix the grammar in some previous post,
though I am not sure if my solution was 100% correct.

&gt;&gt;<i> In meantime I have also managed to play a little with C target and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it is working, I am little worried, as for now I have found 2 problems.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a) I wanted to do some lex/yacc-type return values:
</I>
&gt;<i> This isn't anything to do with the C target - you cannot do that in lexers.
</I>
I think there was small misunderstanding. Indeed lexer do not build
symbol tree, but I was doing something different. I wanted something
like code I've found in examples/Python/calc/Calculator.g:

evaluate returns [result]: r = expression { result = r; };

(this is python syntax, though the usage of 'returns' keyword should
stay the same). The problem is that C target when sees something like &quot;r
= expression&quot; does initialize internal variable with NULL before
assignment. This is improper even in plain C. Consider this example
(just reduced and slightly modified version of
examples/Python/calc/Calculator.g):


grammar Calculator;
options {
  language = C;
}

@members
{
        struct foo
        {
                int bar;
        };
}

evaluate returns [struct foo result]: r=INTEGER {result.bar = 42;};

INTEGER: DIGIT+;

fragment
DIGIT: '0'..'9';

Try to compile it. C compiler will say, that you cannot assign NULL to
foo.

&gt;&gt;<i> b) In some cases, by adding 'innocent' code whole thing crashes. Namely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I only add:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scope MyScope
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       int foo;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the working project based on C.g3pl (without using MyScope anywhere)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and program crashes in very nasty way.
</I>
&gt;<i> Well, are you sure that you have recompiled everything correctly?
</I>
Well, in meantime I switched machines, and on the new machine got the
same problem. Tried to debug it with step-by-step debugging under gdb
and found out, that psr-&gt;translation_unit() call from main() does leave
main, but even do not enter translation_unit() function. After
recompilation it started to work, indeed. Strange thing is that it was
new machine where I downloaded sources from svn and compiled.. Anyway,
program is stable now. And I have found another problem with C target :D

Namely, when I use two scopes in target, e.g. like this:

translation_unit
 scope Symbols;
 scope MyScope;
 @init
 {
      $Symbols::types = ....; //This line stops to work after adding
      MyScope.
 }

Program crashes, since $Symbols is not initialized. It seems, that only
last scope is initialized - as I can access MyScope. If I reverse
scopes like this:

translation_unit
 scope MyScope;
 scope Symbols;

I can @init Symbols, but not MyScope.

&gt;<i> If I get the input you are using, I can try to reproduce it. If you
</I>&gt;<i> are using the supplied input without modification, then it should work
</I>&gt;<i> because I tested it. It is possible that something has broken since I
</I>
Yeah, I also suspected that you tested it, that is why the first problem
described here puzzled me ;)

&gt;<i> last tested it, but I usually test the examples before a snapshot, so
</I>&gt;<i> I am surprised. If I could get anyone to volunteer to write some
</I>&gt;<i> regression/unit tests then I could have more confidence ;-)
</I>
&gt;<i> I see, so you haven't done anything... except change the linking
</I>&gt;<i> model ;-) How are you building the .so and did you relink your calling
</I>&gt;<i> binary program with it or just rebuild the library and try to run with
</I>&gt;<i> it. If the latter, then I suggest that that may well be your problem
</I>&gt;<i> and the reason that stack is out of whack. Do you mean you can't
</I>&gt;<i> reproduce either problem with the original example, or just this
</I>&gt;<i> second one which I think is the way you are building it?
</I>
Yeah, it turned out to be my fault, as described above. It also explains
why I was not able to reproduce problem on supplied example. I linked
.so correctly, just main.o was not recompiled.

&gt;<i> Well, you haven't really given me an exact set of instruction with
</I>&gt;<i> which to reproduce your problems! It wasn't until this email that I
</I>
Yes, I know. It was because I did not had them :) And this is why I knew
that I am alone, as I was not able to tell anybody how to reproduce..

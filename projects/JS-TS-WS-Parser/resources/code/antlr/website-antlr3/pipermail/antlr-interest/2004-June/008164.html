<PRE>The more I read your comments and Monty's article, the clearer it all becomes. But it's a lot to get my brain round. I want to avoid tinkering, for two reasons ... (1) I don't understand Java (or OO programming generally) so the less I need to tackle at once, the easier the learning curve, and (2) I want to convert all this to C++ once I've got a functional grammar that does what I need (I've currently got the tree-parser chucking out an assembler, which I am successfully executing using an interpreter :-)

Seeing as you're heavily involved in all this Antlr stuff :-) would it be possible to add a Filter class to the existing Lexer and Parser classes? There's all this over-riding stuff in what Monty's done and I guess you're into the same sort of thing. And it would be so nice to be able to massage the data stream - for me, for Monty, and maybe for you - as it is passed from the lexer to the parser.

It would be something like

class BASICFilterParser extends FilterParser - taking a token stream from the lexer (or another Filter) and returning a token stream to a parser or filter.

It would then take standard rules, so I would have stuff like

commentst : (SEMI|EOL) (&quot;!&quot;|&quot;*&quot;)! (~(EOL)!*) ;
remarkst : (SEMI|EOL) id:IDENT! {if id.getText != &quot;REM&quot; throw recognitionexception} ... ;

where as you guessed, I expect &quot;!&quot; to mean &quot;don't pass this token on&quot; (or mark it hidden, or whatever).

And I would have to trap Monty's &quot;(GOTO | GO (TO)?) tok:. {if tok.getType != IDENT then tok.setType)IDENT)&quot; stuff ...

Basically the whole thing is a set of rules that, if a match is found, allows the user to manipulate the token stream. Exactly what TokenFilter does at the moment, but using standard grammar rules without making the user over-ride all the internal functions like NextToken (I'm in this way out of my depth here ...)

I haven't totally sussed things here, but we'd need the filter to simply try each rule in turn until one succeeded, and have a default &quot;match anything&quot; rule (I haven't sussed whether the Antlr parser objects to unrecognised tokens ...). And on matching a rule, it simply queues the lot in a buffer for NextToken, before running the rules again when it runs out of buffered tokens.

A little bit of history about the language me, and Monty, and RobC are all trying to parse ... the original DATABASIC dialect was written in assembler using a (now lost) state transition table. INFOBASIC (the dialect I'm best familiar with) was written by a bunch of people whos' attitude was &quot;if we think it's crap, we'll leave it out. Compatibility is nice but not necessary&quot;. This variant never had the REM keyword! UVBasic (the dialect I now use) was written using yacc/lex, and compatibility was very important, so REM can lex as a label, a comment, a function call, and a variable - except the compiler can get confused resulting in compilation errors :-( I'd like to follow the INFOBASIC line and just drop the &quot;REM&quot; keyword, but I suspect it would break far too much code ... And Monty's dialect, AREV BASIC? very similar to INFOBASIC, I believe, but I don't really know anything about it. RobC - if it compiles anywhere, he wants his compiler to compile it :-)

Actually, while composing the previous paragraph in my head, I just realised something VERY useful! I seem to remember reading somewhere, that Antlr wasn't good at state-table type parsing. This FilterParser class would make an almost perfect state-table parser! The lexer would simply lex into IDENTs and NUMs or whatever, then the FilterParser would have a state variable which would be tested in a rule predicate, and within that you simply check the tokens that come through!

Cheers,
Wol

Well technically you could put a lexer there but it would probably teach
you more about antlr internals than you want to know ;) Seriously though,
you can probably do everything you want with an extra parser in between
stuff.

You'll be parsing the token stream and storing tokens in a list/queue while
you don't know what to do with them yet.

You get a setup where:

1. Your original parser asks the filter parser for a token. (by calling LA(x))
2. Your filter parser comes into nextToken
   1. sees wether it has tokens queued to pass on
   2. if not scarf tokens from the original lexer and see what should be
      done with them
   3. pass leftover bits to the calling parser

This is the setup that is explained in Monty's filter example. He's using a
queue to store tokens that are still considered to be passed on.

Consider the nextToken of his filter:

public Token nextToken() throws TokenStreamException
{
   Token ret;
   if (queue.length()&lt;=0)
   {
      try
      {
         jumpStatements();
      }
      catch ( RecognitionException e) {;}
      catch ( TokenStreamException e) {;}
   }
   if (queue.length()&gt;0)
   {
      ret = queue.elementAt(0);
      queue.removeFirst();
      return ret;
   }
   return new ArevToken(Token.EOF_TYPE,&quot;&quot;);
}

jumpStatements in the above is a normal parser rule e.g. it get's it's
tokens from the original lexer. generally this will do a number of LA(x)
calls to get tokens these are checked with the match methods which again
call the consume method when the match is succesfull. This is the mechanism
you want to use.

I'm not 100% sure if it will work but you can probably add a store boolean
attribute to the filter and then:

Original filter rule:

commentst : (EOL | SEMI) (&quot;*&quot; | &quot;!&quot;)! (~(EOL)*)! ;

New:

commentst : { store = true; } (EOL | SEMI) { store = false; }
            (&quot;*&quot; | &quot;!&quot;)! (~(EOL)*)! { store = true } ;

Then in consume you'll only append tokens when store is true. You might
need a 'copy-the-rest' rule as well. Not sure since I'm only just now
tinkering with this stuff myself as well (which also explains my interest
in the topic...).

You can also handcode nextToken to parse'n'massage the incoming token
stream. Considering the complexity of the commentst rule this might be a
good option. Actually it's hardly worth using a parser for it. This might
come a long way just implement the tokenstream abstract interface and use
something like this for filter (this lacks exception handling):

public Token nextToken() throws TokenStreamException
{
	if( queue.size() &lt;= 0 )
	{
		// look for tokens
		if ((LA(1) == EOL) ||(LA(1) == SEMI)) {
			queue.append(LT(1));
			origlexer.consume();

			if ((LA(1) == STAR) || (LA(1) == BANG)) {
				// don't queue
				origlexer.consume();
				while( LA(1) != EOL )
				{
					// don't queue
					origlexer.consume();
				}
			}
			else
			{
				queue.append(LT(1));
				origlexer.consume();
			}
		}
		else
		{
			queue.append(LT(1));
			origlexer.consume();
		}
	}
	if( queue.size() &gt; 0 )
		... return front token of the queue ....
	else
		... return EOFTOKEN ...
}

Monty's original probably needs some tinkering with respect to
EOF/EOL/exception handling for your case.

Cheers,

Ric

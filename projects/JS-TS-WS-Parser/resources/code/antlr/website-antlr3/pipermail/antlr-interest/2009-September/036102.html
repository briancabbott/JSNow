<PRE>I've been struggling with a grammar problem for about three day, but
now I'm really stuck. The AntlrWorks debugger has completely stopped
working for me.

I tried swapping ports, but it didn't help. I figured that maybe
something in my amateur grammar was causing it to get hung up and
leave the port open. So I rebooted and copied a short example from
&quot;The Definitive Antlr Reference&quot; into a fresh file. Same thing:
&quot;Time-out waiting to connect to the remote parser.&quot;

I shut down AntlrWorks, did a netstat -ano and killed the offending
process. I did a netstat -ano again and the port was clear. I
restarted AntlrWorks -- the port was still clear. I hit debug on the
sample grammar and got the same error.

I've been rebooting and killing processes for an hour or two now, and
I can't see a solution. Does anyone know how to solve this?

Here's the grammar I'm using to try to fix this:

r : 'call' ID ';' {System.out.println(&quot;invoke &quot;+$ID.text);} ;
ID: 'a'..'z' + ;
WS: (' ' |'\n' |'\r' )+ {$channel=HIDDEN;} ; // ignore whitespace

Thanks.
</PRE>

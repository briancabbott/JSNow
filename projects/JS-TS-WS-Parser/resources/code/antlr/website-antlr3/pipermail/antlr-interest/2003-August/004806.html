<PRE>&gt;<i> As Marco says one way to solve it is to use state variables but 
</I>this 
&gt;<i> doesn't work in incremental lexing (at least in the netbeans 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation), you need some notion of non-restartable tokens so 
</I>&gt;<i> the state is properly updated, e.g. when you change &quot;options&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> to &quot;optios&quot; it needs to relex the following tokens (left to 
</I>right), 
&gt;<i> to pick up what is now an action, when you delete the curly it 
</I>needs ...

This will work, but you are reinventing the wheel. ANTLR has a 
better solution for this: lexer multiplexing. In fact, the problem 
was that the option specification is an embedded language, with a 
different grammar. The &quot;right&quot; solution is to write two lexers that 
call one another when appropriate. Read the documentation and the 
examples from ANTLR distribution for more details. Ter was probably 
too busy and used a quick hack.

BTW, porting the Netbeans approach in ANTLR might not be a good 
idea. They wanted something very general, that works with any parser 
generator, and had to reimplement many features that ANTLR already 
had.

Best regards,
Bogdan

</I>&gt;<i> OPTIONS: &quot;options&quot; (WS|COMMENT)* LCURLY; // Same for tokens

</I>&gt;<i>     main()   /* comment2 */
</I>&gt;<i>     &#8230;
</I>&gt;<i> comment2 has to be &quot;reassigned&quot; not to BLANK, not to RPAREN but to ID 
</I>&gt;<i> because, according to AST construction from grammar, neither BLANK nor 
</I>&gt;<i> RPAREN will be present in the AST.  So, it seems that we have to know 
</I>&gt;<i> (from inspecting grammar and AST construction) that RPAREN will not be 
</I>&gt;<i> in the AST and skip it as we already skipped the BLANK token.
</I>&gt;<i> As far as we can see it, if a comment goes with a token that will not

</I>&gt;<i> we have to go back and reassign given comment to next token (which

</I>&gt;<i> candidate token will be present in the AST.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is it possible? Are we asking too much?
</I>&gt;<i> Should we reformulate our objective? (To preserve comments as HIDDEN 
</I>&gt;<i> tokens attached to &quot;normal&quot; AST nodes).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your answer(s).

</I>Yes, it is possible. This is exactly the problem that I had to solve.
See /&quot;Preserving the Documentary Structure of Source Code in 
Language-based transformation Tools&quot;/ by Michael L. Van De Vanter at Sun 
Laboratories, which talks about the same issue.

What I do is just before stripping out the comment/newline/whitespace 
tokens, I give each physical line of input a
&quot;loose description&quot; (e.g. &quot;declaration of variable i&quot;, &quot;a for 
statement&quot;, &quot;a comment&quot;, etc). Then, later, after translation is
done, I attempt to put each comment back with the line that it seemed to 
&quot;got with&quot; at the start. I can send you more
details from my top-secret-highly-classified design document in email if 
you'd like :)

Yes, I know. I switched from CVS to Subversion once the latter hit  
1.0 and used it exclusively for approximately three years, so I am  
quite familiar with it. It was a pretty dependable, useful system  
with only a few annoyances (the most significant of which were  
the .svn directories being spewed throughout my working copies). But  
merging sucked for reasons I've outlined in another post to this  
thread. I probably would have put up with it if it weren't for the  
fact that there are so many alternatives out there in which merging  
*doesn't* suck.

I switched to SVK when I couldn't bear the pain of merging any  
longer, and then to Git when I couldn't bear the slowness of SVK  
(Perl seems to be the culprit there). And I am more impressed with  
Git than I have ever been impressed with an SCM before; the developer  
community is highly active and innovative, the codebase is very  
robust and well-tested, it's fast as hell and easy to use once you've  
learnt the basics, so it's hard to believe there will ever be  
anything compelling enough to make me switch away from Git in the  
foreseeable future.

Cheers,
Wincent

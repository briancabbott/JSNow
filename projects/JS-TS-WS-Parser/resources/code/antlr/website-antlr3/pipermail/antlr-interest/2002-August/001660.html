<PRE>Hi Andreas,

	Is there any chance to share that information ?

	I assume this was developed for a paid project. 
	This can Make it difficult to release under BSD or GPL License.

	My primary goal is to use a base to simplify the design of my
Lexer/Parser. If No one else has one I will start from scratch.

	I can only offer to share my modification back with you and others
(Requiring that it is under a Open License). And I hope this is enough
incentive (more brain on same problem).


Thanks in Advance,


Bernard Guillot

Yes, but there are still a few bugs and we are uncertain under what license
it might be released.

Ciao,
Andreas

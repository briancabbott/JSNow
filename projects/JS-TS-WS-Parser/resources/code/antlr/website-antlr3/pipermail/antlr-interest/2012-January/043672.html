It's important to admit when you've been going in the wrong direction, no matter how painful. I'm just embarrassed I didn't see this point earlier. most (but not all) of the applications I've built over the last decade or two would have been easier with listeners

Yeah, those guys are very smart and it's a cool tool.

&gt;<i> As a hint to Sam Harwell, I have considered creating an F# library for the

Yep, I'm interested to know what people think about rewriting parse trees. certainly that's what most of the European tools do.

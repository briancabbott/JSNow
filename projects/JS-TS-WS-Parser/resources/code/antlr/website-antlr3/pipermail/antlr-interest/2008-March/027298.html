To elaborate just a tiny bit, you might say this is a superficial 
difference but if you ask a tree from the tool it will of necessity return 
a parse tree because that's the only thing it can return (it can't possibly 
know what kind of AST you want) whereas if you build the tree you will, 
well, not &quot;of necessity&quot; but almost certainly build an AST of sorts, 
reflecting your post-processing needs and thus the semantics of the 
language. Thus in practice the parse tree vs. AST divide tends to overlap 
neatly with the by-default vs. explicitly built divide.

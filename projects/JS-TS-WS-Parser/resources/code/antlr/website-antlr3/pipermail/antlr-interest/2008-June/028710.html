<PRE>  Hi everybody,
  Sorry to disturb you, I've been successfully using ANTLR v3 with JAVA for
3 months now, for one client, and I'm pretty happy with it.

  Now I tried to generate a C++ parser for another project, and I was quite
disapointed by the absence of support for C++ and the very poor support for
C... First I tried the 3.0.1, which was generated 'good' c sources, but I
was stuck with de C/C++ interface, I needed to have more 'C++' inside my
rules, and the 'extern &quot;C&quot; {}' was too restrictive. (Needed a lot of 'glue
code' to interface the C++ classes).
Then I tried to #include my generated parser files in C into some CPP file.
It worked well except a 'cast' problem (which I localized in the C.stg code
generation template...) that was preventing to compile things like : TFoo
tmp = ANTL3_MALLOC(sizeof(TFoo)).
I hesitated to patch the stg and recompile ANTLR (still 3.0.1 at that time).

  When I remember about a recent beta, which I installed immediatly. Nice
:<i>)... But... ;)
</I>  ...But it seems things are worse !!! I still haven't noticed any cast
problem (yet... :) ). But I found some weird bug, which seems to show the
generated code (I assume from the current C .stgs) is buggy. Sorry, I'm
surprised, (maybe it's on my side but I can't understand how...).

  First here is a extract of my grammar source :

[...]
defIndexed
 : INDEXED sz=bitWidth id=identifier '[' cnt=immediateInteger ']'
access=quotedString
 {
  SStringPtr l_pidStr=$id.s;
[...]

[...]
identifier returns [SStringPtr s]
 : quoted=IDENTIFIER
  {
   const char* l_pString=(const char*)($quoted.text-&gt;chars);
   $s = newStringFromLimitedString(1+l_pString,strlen(l_pString)-2);
  }
 ;
[...]

  This looks alright for me, I had almost the same rule in my JAVA project
and it works well. (I remind you that this was not a problem on ANTLR
v3.01)...

  Now here is the generated code by ANTLR :

// The 'buggy' rule code :
static MyparserParser_defIndexed_return
defIndexed(pMyparserParser ctx)
{
 [...]
    id=identifier(ctx);
    [...]
    //Here is the generated code for the rule action :
    {
  SStringPtr l_pidStr=( id != NULL ? id.s : NULL ); //!! THis is NOT a
pointer !!
  [...]
[...]
// The indifier rule that seems to works well...
static MyparserParser_identifier_return
identifier(pMyparserParser ctx)
{
    MyparserParser_cpu_identifier_return retval;
[..]
    return retval;
}
  As you can see, the 'identifier' rule implementation returns its result
into a 'by value' struct, whereas the 'defIndexed' rule implementation try
to see if a 'by reference' (some kind of pointer) result exists...
  I would be greatly surprise to be the first one to find this bug, it seems
so straightforward... Did I do something wrong ? Did I miss something ? I'll
have another note as I 'digged' into the C runtime project, the beta version
has several 'vsrulesfiles' directory (all empty but one... :) ), and some
other 'ghost/empties' directory. It seems far more 'work in progress' than
the 3.0.1.

  Also : I'm a 'warning killer maniac' and compile (using Visual C++ 2005),
in warning level 4, warning as error...

  Finally, as a C++ programmer I don't mind you use classes in your
parser... It can be a C target only. Just if it can compile 'embedded' in a
C++ file, or C++ compliant, without warnings. The most important stuff for a
'C++ ANTLR user' (or for me :) ), is to be able to use 'C++' code inside my
rules actions. I don't mind if ANTLR generated code or ANTLR runtime is C++
or not. I need 'my code' to be C++ that's it. :)

  Despite my first contact with the community is to report a bug, great job
to all of you.
  Thank you !

(By the way : ANTLR is a GREAAAT tool, as a long time 'parser geek' I enjoy
it, and it opens more new perspectives to me :) ).

Garry.

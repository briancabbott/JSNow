<PRE>Hi Addi,

&gt;<i> The issue is rather simple in terms of legalities but complex in the
</I>&gt;<i> eyes of us as developers! Basically the issue is that ANTLR licensing
</I>&gt;<i> does not explicitly state that those who have contributed (or will
</I>&gt;<i> contribute)  to ANTLR can not claim anything financially or otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> in any form or shape now or anytime in the future (i.e. standard open
</I>&gt;<i> source licensing). The legal thinking is that anyone who has
</I>&gt;<i> contributed to ANTLR can in effect claim monetary rewards from any
</I>&gt;<i> company that uses the ANTLR parser (and its runtime library) in its
</I>&gt;<i> product(s). Understandably comapnies (especially large corporations)
</I>&gt;<i> can not (and in fact will not) be able to use the product for their
</I>&gt;<i> own protections.
</I>
I just had a look at the license, and it places ANTLR in the public
domain.  Public domain means /you/ own the code as much as does anyone
else -- we own it collectively as a human race.  One cannot claim any
rights over things placed in the public domain.  That is the nature of
public domain -- all proprietary rights are revoked.

Perhaps your lawyers are concerned that not all contributors have stated
that their contributions are also placed in the public domain?  This
might be a legitimate concern, I don't know.  But barring someone
claiming their code made it into the product 'by accident', public
domain is about as good a deal as you can get.  And a very generous
action by the authors.

Later,
   Chris.

<PRE>For what it can do. I think $49 is very reasonable price :)

</I>&gt;<i> Sent: Thursday, September 22, 2005 12:25 AM
</I>&gt;<i> To: ANTLR Interest
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [antlr-interest] Price of Antlr Studio
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The price of ANTLR Studio for a single user license would be -
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 49$
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For all those who are against the commercialization of ANTLR Studio-
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I dont know why you guys are against commercial software. I think
</I>&gt;<i> commercial is the best way to develop a software, especially one like
</I>&gt;<i> an IDE . NO,I *DO NOT* think free, open source, gpled software is the
</I>&gt;<i> best way to develop software. I think money is a good motive to
</I>&gt;<i> develop software and if possible I would really like to make money by
</I>&gt;<i> doing so than in any other way. Yes, i do think money motivates one to
</I>&gt;<i> develop software. You do tend to give something a higher priority if
</I>&gt;<i> you get paid for it. And if you give a higher priority to something it
</I>&gt;<i> does turn out better.  I do think ANTLR would a far better software
</I>&gt;<i> and there would be far earlier releases of it if we all paid Terence
</I>&gt;<i> 500$ each time we downloaded it. (No offense meant Terence. Please
</I>&gt;<i> dont take this in the wrong way.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Take for example eclipse itself. Sure its free, but the developers who
</I>&gt;<i> develop it are paid highly by IBM to sit and code, cause it serves IBM
</I>&gt;<i> in their strategy for software services which makes them money
</I>&gt;<i> eventually. They dont give eclipse for free cause they like you and
</I>&gt;<i> care for you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As i have already mentioned before i want to make the best IDE for
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR and and i dont think i can do that by giving it for free. If you
</I>&gt;<i> can please go ahead and make one.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Someone mentioned something about 'freedom'.  Hell, its an IDE , what
</I>&gt;<i> freedom do you want other than to use it? If you want to develop on
</I>&gt;<i> top of it maybe in the next version i can put in an interface for
</I>&gt;<i> plugins.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, if by freedom you mean that you take the source , change it
</I>&gt;<i> a wee bit and add your name to it, then NO , you cant do that and i
</I>&gt;<i> would not want you to do that either.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PRASHANT

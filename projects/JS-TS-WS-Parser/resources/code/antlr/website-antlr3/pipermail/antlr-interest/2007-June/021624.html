<PRE>Hi all
I have a strange error with java5 grammar. If I turn on rewrite mode
(options {k=2; backtrack=true; memoize=true; output=template;
rewrite=true;}), the following rule works:

    | 'break' Identifier? ';'      -&gt; template(c={$text}) &quot;
System.out.println(\&quot;BREAK123\&quot;); &lt;c&gt;&quot;

whereas the following one:
    | 'break' Identifier? ';'      -&gt; template(c={$text}) &quot;
System.out.println(\&quot;BREAK1234\&quot;); &lt;c&gt;&quot;

provokes the following incredibile message:

and possibly adding a syntactic predicate.

Having a template message a char longer is really an issue?? I cannot guess
what I'm missing...

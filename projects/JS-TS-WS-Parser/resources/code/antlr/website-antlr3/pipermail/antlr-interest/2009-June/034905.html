<PRE>Hi Jim,

 

Thanks for your reply. 

 

1.       I changed my grammar to be the format you gave to get more
meaningful error message, but it still failed to enter the
mismatched_set_exception, instead it incurred
no_viable_alternative_exception... Did I do anything wrong? Or how
exactly the mismatched set exception can be incurred?

2.       There is no embedded SKIP() method in c antlr lexer, I used
&quot;EMIT()&quot;, apparently it does the same thing. Good to know that it's
another way of suppressing lexer error report in addition to assigning a
function that does nothing to ReportError of the lexer.

 

Regards,

Linlin

Hi Jim,

 

Thanks for your reply. We finally figure out that large number of
expecting is actually -1, which is EOF. 

Yes - I figured as much. 



I guess this would rule out the possibility of a bug in antlr, if we
don't speak of the appropriateness of the message. In the use case I
mentioned in my last email, I would think start(Rule2), start(Rule3) and
; all should be the expected tokens, instead of EOF. Do you think if
there is anything antlr can do to improve the error messages to make
them more relevant? Or should I improve my grammar to get more
appropriate error messages, and how?

You have to write your own message display routines that make sense with
your grammar. The default ones do check for EOF though. Your issue is
that because all the things leading up to EOF are optional, ANTLR
assumes that they are just not present:

Say start(rule2) is FOO and start(rule3) is BAR.

Then after rule1 it says:

No FOO is there, so go past Rule2, it isn't present
No BAR is there so go past Rule3, it isn't present

Now, what is the start set that can come next? Only EOF, so match EOF -
oh it failed, so the expecting token is -1 for EOF.

However, if you do this:

:<i> rule1
</I>    (   rule2
          (
               rule3 EOF
             | EOF
          )
       | rule3 EOF
       | EOF
    )
;

Now, after rule1 has parsed, the followset will be FOO | BAR|EOF so you
will get the error straight away. After rule2 is parsed, followset will
be BAR|EOF so you will get the error straight away, after rule3, only
EOF is viable.



 

Also I can see when the displayRecognitionError() checks the recognizer
type, it only considers either parser or tree parser, why is lexer not
considered here?

1) Lexers can only say: &quot;Not expecting character 'y' here. and so
antlr3lexer.c has its own handler. You should install your own handler
remember?
2) If your lexer is throwing errors, then it is broken really. It should
be coded to cope with anything one way or another. However, sometimes
that is difficult of course. You need to make sure that your lexer rules
can terminate just about anywhere, but throw your own (descriptive
error) about any missing pieces. Then you have a final lexer rule:

ANY : . { SKIP(); log error about unknown character being ignored.

What this does is then move all your error handling up to the parser,
where you have better context. Similarly, you should move any errors
that you can out the parser and in to the tree parser, where once again
you have better context. The classic example is trying to code the
number of parameters that any particular function can take. Don;t do
that, accept any, including 0, then check for validity in your first
tree walk.



I can see that a lexer error is considered a No Via Alt parser
exception, but there is still lexer error report from antlr, where can I
find the lexer error report code? Or how can I intercept the lexer error
like I do with the parser error report?

Intercept the same way, install your own displayRecognitionError, but
make it say &quot;Internal compiler error - lexer rules bad :-(  all your
base belong to us&quot;

Jim

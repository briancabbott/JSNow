&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  well you have to store the data in some way and recording the  
</I>&gt;<i> grammatical structure by encoding it in the structure the tree seems  
</I>&gt;<i> useful regardless of what you're doing.  Better than a linked list of  
</I>&gt;<i> the input tokens right?   I guess you are saying you don't really  
</I>&gt;<i> care about the data structure because you are doing a declarative  
</I>&gt;<i> rule-based translation.
</I>
Right. I'm using a List of Tokens, and it works great for me. I think of 
&quot;public static void main(String[] args)&quot; as a sequence
of 8 tokens. That's a much simpler mental picture (at least for me) than 
whatever AST that parses to.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   I agree that the declarative approach works best in many  
</I>&gt;<i> situations.  On the other hand, I am not sure that what you say in  
</I>&gt;<i> your article is that bad: &quot;part of your work is being done with  
</I>&gt;<i> treewalking, and part is done at the end.&quot;
</I>
I just know that for my app, the treewalking almost always seems more 
difficult than the alternative (which is sometimes
declarative, and sometime just &quot;code that does the job&quot;). One exception 
is expressions: when I need to parse a
conditional expression to change it from a &quot;int&quot; type to a &quot;boolean&quot; 
type, I use an AST, for example.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  one of my big problems though with the declarative approach is that  
</I>&gt;<i> you can easily generate an infinite loop.  I believe this is nicely  
</I>&gt;<i> formalized in many of the papers done by the declarative approach  
</I>&gt;<i> people and is the raison d'etre for Stratego that tries to let you  
</I>&gt;<i> specify what the order of evaluation is for applying rules.  You can  
</I>&gt;<i> clearly get a situation where you loop forever.  Of course, I suppose  
</I>&gt;<i> that you can simply look for where the loop is by tracing the rule  
</I>&gt;<i> applications, but anyone who is programmed in prolog says that it's  
</I>&gt;<i> very difficult to debug when your list of rules doesn't work.
</I>
Yes, that's a problem. Ordering of phases is a huge problem too.
But at least I can deal with these problems...I couldn't seem to even 
get going with initial design/development
using the treewalking approach.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I was raving about this like 7 years ago, it just totally rocks!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Check the archives for my posts about multiple tree grammars, or ask
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> questions if something isn't clear.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> By the last pass, I had a completely vb tree, and then I finally
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> dumped it to text.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I had looked very carefully at all your stuff when I started 4  years 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ago.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My feeling is that if you're going to do a &quot;natural&quot; translation -  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that is:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> String hello = &quot;hello&quot;;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> String world = &quot;world&quot;;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> printf(&quot;%s %s\n&quot;, hello, world);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...becomes...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> System.out.println(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then the &quot;walking the AST&quot; approach doesn't come close to working.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The two ASTs for those two code chunks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have almost nothing in common, and doing that translation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is 1% a &quot;tree-manipulation&quot; problem, and 99% a &quot;code mapping&quot; problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I disagree.  Somehow  you have to find these patterns whether  
</I>&gt;<i> you're looking at the symbol table that was previously populated or  
</I>&gt;<i> you're walking looking at the flow trying to figure out the variables  
</I>&gt;<i> are.  
</I>
But the problem is that many phases can update the symbol table. Every 
time you move a variable declaration
from one place to another, rename a variable, change its type or its 
initial value or modifiers. So I've found that
generally, instead of a symbol table, it's better to just have code that 
can search through the code as it currently
stands and find the variable declaration and examine it.

I don't mean to come out against symbol tables in general, just in this 
case.

&gt;<i> Just for the record I am opposed to the translation you show  here.  
</I>&gt;<i> That is not at all what I would expect unless it's clear that  those 
</I>&gt;<i> variables are always constants.
</I>

Ahh...and therein lies the difference in our approaches. It's not what 
you'd *expect* because of your background
in language tools. But is it what you'd *want* as a customer who wants 
to replace C code with Java? Answer: customers
don't want &quot;JOBOL&quot;, and they don't want &quot;Cava&quot;. (Although, if they do 
want C in Java clothes, there's
a tool for that: <A HREF="http://ovid.tigris.org/Ephedra/">http://ovid.tigris.org/Ephedra/</A>)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think if tree-walking works for most of the translation work, you  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> either
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have two very similar languages, or your output code looks just  like 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> input code with different syntax. &quot;I don't want 'JOBOL'&quot;, as one of my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> customers said :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> heh heh heh...yes, very interesting point.  I was very happy with my  
</I>&gt;<i> annotate the tree approach for mantra which yields like
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     mlist c = mArrayList.of((
</I>&gt;<i>     new Object() {
</I>&gt;<i>       public mstream value(final mstream _input) {
</I>&gt;<i>         mint i = new mint(0);
</I>&gt;<i>         mlist _data = new mArrayList();
</I>&gt;<i>         _input.start();
</I>&gt;<i>         while (_input.more()) {
</I>&gt;<i>           mstring n = (mstring)_input.next();
</I>&gt;<i>           if ( (n).notEquals((new mstring(&quot;Tom&quot;))) ) {
</I>&gt;<i>           mobject _result = null;
</I>&gt;<i>           _data.add(_result);
</I>&gt;<i>           }
</I>&gt;<i>           i = new mint(i.v+1); // huge waste
</I>&gt;<i>         }
</I>&gt;<i>         _input.stop(); // put this in a finally
</I>&gt;<i>         mstream _str = new mListStream(_data);
</I>&gt;<i>         return _str;
</I>&gt;<i>       }
</I>&gt;<i>     }
</I>&gt;<i>     )
</I>&gt;<i>     .value(((mobject)names).toStream()));
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> from the simple looking:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> list c = names:{string n, n!=&quot;Tom&quot;};
</I>
Hehehe...yup. A large part of my time is spent going the other way. 
Many, many times,
you have 20 lines of C code that should (in my view) be replaced with 
one line of Java.
Actually getting that to work in a general way is fun but close to 
impossible.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  naturally, this was easy because even though it's big it's still a  
</I>&gt;<i> one-to-one mapping, albeit with a complicated template.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am very much warming to your ideas about the declarative approach,  
</I>&gt;<i> although the pure declarative approach is not something that has  
</I>&gt;<i> proven popular with users.  All of the large tools that do this sort  
</I>&gt;<i> of thing are so collocated that programmers won't use it.  Your  
</I>&gt;<i> specific declarative system seems very nice and I would like to see  
</I>&gt;<i> more of it some time.
</I>
Cool. Keep up the great work! I'm a slow adopter, but I am looking 
forward to v3.
COBOL seems to have been built for infinite lookahead :(

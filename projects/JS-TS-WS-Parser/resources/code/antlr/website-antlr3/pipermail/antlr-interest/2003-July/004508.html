That's already fixed in my devel snapshots. Ter changed this shortly before
release and I missed because I had too little time to retest the stuff
before release.

I started to use that stuff after java screwed up dependencies on me a few
times. Maybe that it's better now. In general this makefile thing compiles
antlr's java stuff faster than default javac on all the files on my Sun.
Also it builds along all the other antlr stuff I'm interested in.

I considered using Terence's java built for it when I fixed the stuff when
I fixed it after 2.7.2 release, decided against it though since the
configure script catches some stuff that needed to be caught anyway and I
don't want to do a javac `find . *.java` etc. to do small recompiles on my
system since it's slow.

After compress that java_deps file only amounts to 23k nothing to get
excited about ;) It is generated with Bob Werken's javad (which again uses
antlr) so I have faith in the quality of the dependencies.

Currently I don't see reasons to meddle with my Makefile system anymore, it
works. At a later point I might change it to use Terence's java build tool.

Cheers,

Ric

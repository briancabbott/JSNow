Maybe I was thinking of rule parameters.


&gt;<i> I think you can use scopes (though I also recall some discussion

I'll try member vars.

&gt;<i> This is looking complicated enough (and with embedded whitespace

</I>
My knowledge on such things is pretty limited, but I think I'm better
off with it in the lexer. I need to detect these embedded XML-ish
tags, then opaquely match everything through to the matching close
tag, and then farm the lot out to an external program. I don't want
any kind of AST for the tag or its contents, for example. However, I
guess I will end up with a massive token.

I'm a bit confused about what will happen if I use the parser instead:
I will get a sequence of basically meaningless tokens whose types I
will just ignore. Maybe it's ok.

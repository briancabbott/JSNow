Yes, I think that's it exactly.
It seems to me that something like a C-to-Java translator
is more like an English-to-Spanish translator than it is like
a C-to-object code compiler. The work that needs to be done
is so large and complicated, that it lends itself to
a pattern-matching-and-replacement approach rather than
a traverse-the-AST approach.

I did investigate some of the natural language translation tools,
and there were lots of different approaches, but most were
loose pattern-matching approaches. That's because parsing
English into a tree-like structure (English grammar...noun,
verb, etc) doesn't do much for you. The rules for translation
are so complicated that you can't say &quot;when we see a noun, do
the following&quot;. You might think that you could say
&quot;when we find adjective-noun, change it to noun-adjective&quot;, but
there are so many thousands of exceptions to that rule that
it doesn't help much to think in that way.

I mean look at this huge list of just some of what's
 needed to convert
C to Java, omitting almost all detail:

How can you specify
that kind of functionality in a tree grammar?  You'll end up
with tens of thousands of lines of code embedded within
a couple of hundred lines of grammar. Moving the code
out into another file doesn't change much.

I don't want to &quot;walk the tree&quot;, I want to &quot;search the tree
for patterns and make replacements&quot;. If the tree transformations
can all be nicely specified in a little language (like TXL),
then that's fine. But from what I've seen, TXL looks
pretty limited and cryptic too.

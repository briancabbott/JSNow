You can also sell a binary of ANTLR Studio GPL
licensed for say $49 a copy but provide the source
code for no less than say a $40,000 fee.  This is the
model TheKompany uses with its GPL'd software.

Richard Stallman didn't like it much, but he agreed it
was legal.

Again, I strongly recommend just giving it away using
it as an advertising for your services
making/enhancing compilers for customers.  You will
definitely make more money this way than with a
commercial, per-user license.  Show me one company
that failed to make profitability using this model?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some people are saying that there is nothing in
</I>&gt;<i> GPL that does not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allow you to charge for your product.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, that is true, but it also says that you gotta
</I>&gt;<i> distribute the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; source along for free.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now even a bonehead can conclude that if you can
</I>&gt;<i> get the source code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for free then you would rather just download it
</I>&gt;<i> and compile it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; yourself than pay for the software. after all it
</I>&gt;<i> takes only a minute
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to compile. So NO, get this clear, if your
</I>&gt;<i> software is GPLd , it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; CANNOT be sold. Especially one like an IDE.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I sold a GPLed tool for 12k $ recently. The
</I>&gt;<i> customer had a problem, it 
</I>&gt;<i> fixes it, and now the customer is willing to pay for
</I>&gt;<i> more features.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That said some parts of ANTLR Studio do come under
</I>&gt;<i> the Sun Public
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; License and source will be provided with them.
</I>&gt;<i> Specifically the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; AntlrStudio.Lexer_1.0.0.jar distributed with the
</I>&gt;<i> beta is under SPL.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can download the source even now from netbeans
</I>&gt;<i> site.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2.) Why dont i give the IDE for free and charge
</I>&gt;<i> for services? Doesnt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; redhat use the same business model?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is a difference between providing support
</I>&gt;<i> for an IDE and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; providing it for and Operating System.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also AS has from the begining been designed such
</I>&gt;<i> that you can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instantly start using it ful fledged without
</I>&gt;<i> reading any manuals or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requiring any support. If you watch the videos you
</I>&gt;<i> will see it says -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Time to learn ANTLR Studio - 0 minutes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So if you have used Eclipse before you should get
</I>&gt;<i> started with using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; AS right away. There is nothing new to learn. No
</I>&gt;<i> new keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shortcuts, etc. You dont need to modify your code
</I>&gt;<i> for use with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; debugger. Hell, you dont even need to press
</I>&gt;<i> Ctrl+Space to auto
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complete!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All the people who have got the beta version have
</I>&gt;<i> been able to use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without requiring any help from me ( aside from
</I>&gt;<i> the bugs they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; encountered).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3.) Somebody said something like giving the
</I>&gt;<i> software away with GPL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allows the small guy to gain advantage in the
</I>&gt;<i> market.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I will correct you on this. Yes, it does so, but
</I>&gt;<i> only when the the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; small guy is competing in a *large* market. The
</I>&gt;<i> market for language
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tools is small, very small and i wont be surpised
</I>&gt;<i> if ANTLR Studio soon
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; becomes the leaading tool in the market.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4.) Some guys are saying that ANTLR should have
</I>&gt;<i> been GPLed so that all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tools for it would be GPL and that i am *selling*
</I>&gt;<i> the work of Terence!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This really is the craziest message i have got.
</I>&gt;<i> NO, I am NOT selling
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Terence's work! ANTLR is still free and can be
</I>&gt;<i> downloaded free of cost
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from antlr.org. ANTLR Studio has been designed
</I>&gt;<i> from the ground up by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me and me alone.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The reason why ANTLR is not GPL is cause then
</I>&gt;<i> every program that uses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it would need to be GPLed and Terence certainly
</I>&gt;<i> doesnt want that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I had a talk with Terence regarding ANTLR Studio
</I>&gt;<i> going commercial and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; he told me that he was perfectly fine with it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This seems to be *pragmatic* vs *moral*. Some recent
</I>&gt;<i> post said that the only 
</I>&gt;<i> thing that matters is the &quot;usefulness&quot; of the
</I>&gt;<i> software. Maybe that is too 
</I>&gt;<i> ambitious. I find that point of view respectful, but
</I>&gt;<i> weak. In some sense, I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> also pragmatic. I use only Free software because it
</I>&gt;<i> provides me the warranty 
</I>&gt;<i> that I will never regret: everything I learn,
</I>&gt;<i> whatever customizations I do, 
</I>&gt;<i> will help me improving the way I use the tool.
</I>&gt;<i> Non-free software doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> allow me to improve my skills but using their rules:
</I>&gt;<i> papers and keyboard 
</I>&gt;<i> shortcuts, at most.
</I>&gt;<i> I once used a tool called Together. I should had
</I>&gt;<i> used Emacs since the 
</I>&gt;<i> beginning, despite all the features Together had. Me
</I>&gt;<i> as a professional cannot 
</I>&gt;<i> afford going back and forward.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But anyway, if GPL makes it more difficult to make
</I>&gt;<i> money, do you think 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;closing&quot; it will give you better results? I wish
</I>&gt;<i> you luck, but it's not 
</I>&gt;<i> about the GPL: you just don't care enough about the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;4 freedoms&quot; of ANTLR 
</I>&gt;<i> Studio customers. You just discard thinking about
</I>&gt;<i> that *moral* stuff unless 
</I>&gt;<i> you got your monetary compensation. I hope you'd
</I>&gt;<i> reconsider it should you get 
</I>&gt;<i> rich ;).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PRASHANT
</I>&gt;<i>

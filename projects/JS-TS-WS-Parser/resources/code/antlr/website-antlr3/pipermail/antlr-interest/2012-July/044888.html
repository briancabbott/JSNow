As far as I can tell, this is essentially what the linux kernel
project does: <A HREF="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;f=Documentation/SubmittingPatches;hb=HEAD#l298">http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;f=Documentation/SubmittingPatches;hb=HEAD#l298</A>
. I suppose you would want to specify somewhere prominent (e.g. the
pull request form, if possible) that adding the signoff to your commit
that you are certifying the Certificate of Origin.

</I>&gt;<i> Let's make a directory that's part of the source code itself that contains simple text documents with the language of the contributors license followed by the sign off line.

I think using GUIDs and/or hash numbers is going a little overboard,
particularly when contributors are all github users, hence already
have a globally unique user id. I also think having one text file per
contributor is a little much as well, considering we only need a
signature.

My suggestion is to have one text file, with the Contributor's License
for the project, with a spot for contributors to digitally sign it,
where &quot;digitally sign&quot; = a commit that adds a line containing the
contributor's real name, github username, and email address (optional;
I guess it's not really necessary in this scheme). Thus the bar for
accepting a pull request by a contributor is, at a minimum: a) the
pull request contains a commit signing the license or the contributor
has already signed the license, and b) all other commits have the
signed-off-by line by the user submitting the pull request [and the
signed-off-by is a certification that it's all their code, etc etc.].
Someone who accepts the pull request will want to verify the
contributor has signed the license by checking for their name in the
license file.

The upside to this is that we don't need to add an opaque hex id that
github will recognize and linkify (but not local git) to each of our
commit messages; we'd only need to add the &quot;-s&quot; flag every time.
Really the only differences here are that we put all the signatures in
one file and not require a link to that commit from every future
commit. If we put that one file in the top level of the project, I
would posit (without being a lawyer) that that's just as effective.

I'm not actually sure how well github allows editing of commit
messages, but if possible, it should be simple to request that a new
contributor (who filed a pull request without doing all of this) sign
the license and add the commit to their pull request, and add the
signed-off-by message to their commits.

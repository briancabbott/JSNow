<PRE>Hi,

Didn't notice any bugs in them I hardly ever touch them. But maybe some of
the later changes introduce some new interaction that let's something bad
happen.

&gt;<i> As I've found out, `operator=(const T*)' and `operator T*()' are unsafe
</I>
The operator T*() I already replace in TokenRefCount with a operator bool()
which is somewhat safer.

&gt;<i> (in Boost, for example, these aren't defined at all). When implemented
</I>&gt;<i> together, not only they are unsafe, they are rather dangerous since they
</I>&gt;<i> can lead to nonshared ownership of a single object and therefore to its
</I>&gt;<i> premature deletion.
</I>
I personally did not run into premature deletion problems (using a malloc
debugger very regularly to verify my project) There might be a resource
leak though but I'm not sure wether that's due to antlr or my own code.

&gt;<i> Consider the code from BaseAST.cpp (the problems I experience now are
</I>&gt;<i> caused by the implicit misuse of smart pointers in this function):
</I>
I'll have a look at this when I'm not two days behind on sleep... (probably
a lot safer ;) )

&gt;<i> rule
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>     RefAST ast = #[TOKEN];
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> :
</I>&gt;<i>     (
</I>&gt;<i>         index:expression
</I>&gt;<i>         {
</I>&gt;<i>             ast-&gt;addChild(#index);
</I>&gt;<i>         }
</I>&gt;<i>     )+
</I>&gt;<i> ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And as the new `expression' is assigned to `index', the reference count
</I>&gt;<i> for the old falls to zero and the object is deleted instead of staying
</I>&gt;<i> in memory until the reference in the tree is released as well. When I
</I>&gt;<i> then call getNumberOfChildren() the program hangs :(
</I>
Shouldn't there be a '!' on this rule to turn of automatic
treeconstruction? (unless you have it turned off on grammar level) This
might create a loop in the tree which might hang up getNumberOfChildren if
I'm not mistaken.

Cheers,

Ric

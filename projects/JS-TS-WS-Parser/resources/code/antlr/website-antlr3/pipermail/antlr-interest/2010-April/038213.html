<PRE>I've made a few changes locally in the generated code for the CSharp3
target. Partial methods are new to C# 3, and were added so generated
code can add extensibility points. The partial methods and all calls to
them in generated code are *completely* removed by the compiler if there
is no implementation provided in another file.

 

1.       The partial methods &quot;void EnterRule(string ruleName, int
ruleIndex)&quot; and &quot;void LeaveRule(string ruleName, int ruleIndex)&quot; are
generated, and a call to each is placed at the beginning and end of each
rule.

 

2.       For each rule, the partial methods &quot;void Enter[RuleName]()&quot; and
&quot;void Leave[RuleName]()&quot; are generated. They are called *outside* of the
calls to EnterRule and LeaveRule (Enter[RuleName] before EnterRule,
Leave[RuleName] after LeaveRule).

 

3.       The -trace flag no longer affects the generated code. Calls to
BaseRecognizer.TraceIn and BaseRecognizer.TraceOut are always included
in the generated code, and the methods are now marked
[Conditional(&quot;ANTLR_TRACE&quot;)]. The calls are *inside* the calls to
EnterRule and LeaveRule.

 

4.       The partial method &quot;void OnCreated()&quot; is called at the end of
the constructor.

 

5.       The partial method &quot;void CreateTreeAdaptor(ref ITreeAdaptor
adaptor)&quot; is generated for tree parsers. Implement this method if you
want to use a tree adaptor other than CommonTreeAdaptor - no more need
to place conditional initialization inside your rules.

 

I'm also open to suggestions for other partial methods to add, which is
why I included this on the antlr-interest list.

 

Thanks,

Sam

It's a mess internally but it is very stable.

I will do my best to find this and fix bugs until 3.0 comes out, but  
for the most part people seem very happy with 2.0.  I was mainly  
indicating how much I don't like the internals of the old system.   
The v3 is almost identical to the old in grammar functionality so I'm  
pleased with the human interface clearly :)

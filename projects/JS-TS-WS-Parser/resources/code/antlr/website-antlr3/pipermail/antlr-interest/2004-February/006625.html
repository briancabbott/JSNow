<PRE>Quoting Terence Parr &lt;<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">parrt at cs.usfca.edu</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> &gt; Long version:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Forums:  I hate web-based forums (the way Jive is normally used) so I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hope that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you will replace yahoogroups with a mailing list. At the very least, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allow us to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recieve messages in my email, allow us to post messages via email, and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allow us
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to reply to messages with our email programs' &quot;reply&quot; command.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There will always be an email gateway.  What don't you like about 
</I>&gt;<i> forums?  Now's the time to figure out what we want :)
</I>
You have to log in to post (and sometimes to read, if you want proper &quot;I've
already read this&quot; tracking), and I prefer a &quot;push&quot; interface (email is sent to
me) to a &quot;pull&quot; interface (I check a website to see if somebody posted something
new). 

&gt;<i> &gt;  Why would you want antlr.org to host blogs that aren't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ANTLR-specific? There are so many blogging hosts out there right now, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what is the advantage to our &quot;ANTLR community&quot; to adding another one at 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; antlr.org?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> None.  I don't plan on allowing any blogs other than mine.  Perhaps if 
</I>&gt;<i> Monty wants one for somethign purely antlr related.
</I>
I see, it wasn't clear in the original message that this is what you meant.

&gt;<i> &gt; Personally, I'd rather see a read-only ANTLR 3 source code repository 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (perforce, subversion, or cvs).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You shall have it, sir!  The thing is though that I'll not release it 
</I>&gt;<i> publicly until it's semi mature.  It's in my &quot;playground&quot; now and not 
</I>&gt;<i> yet in my formal code repository.  The code is too damn readable also 
</I>&gt;<i> ;)  I'd hate for somebody to scoop me by building ANTLR 3 before I did 
</I>&gt;<i> ;)
</I>
Understandable. I was thinking to write a ANTLR code generator for a functional
language (ML or Nice) and so I wanted to see the &quot;playground&quot; so I can see what
sort of project it would be.

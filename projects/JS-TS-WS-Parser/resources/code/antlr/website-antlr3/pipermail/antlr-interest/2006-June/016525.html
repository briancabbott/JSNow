<PRE>Howdy,

As I rebuild the decisions for cyclic DFA, some simplifications  
present themselves.  These new DFA I'm generating are capable of  
handling all decisions, even the ones with predicates.  I wacked a  
few hundred lines of CyclicDFACodeGenerator.java and think that we  
should consider doing the same for ACyclicDFACodeGenerator that  
handles LL(k) decisions.  Right now there are 2 parallel mechanisms  
in the codegen logic and generated code for LL(k) and LL(*) decisions.

My argument would be that having a single codegen strategy is more  
robust, easier to understand, easier to port, and smaller.  The only  
concern would be that it might be a bit slower to do LL(1) decisions  
this way as I'd need a method call to get to the DFA simulation  
code.  OTOH, switches almost always amount to a binary search rather  
than the quick jump via a transition table.

Actually, their is another issue related to (..)? and (..)* blocks.   
For (..)? example, you don't want the DFA testing the lookahead for  
the bypass state.  It delays error detection but is more what people  
expect.  For (X)? people expect &quot;if ( LA(1)==X ) match(X);&quot; rather  
than having an else clause that tests to see if the lookahead is  
consistent with what follows (X)?  Hmmm...seems like I could just  
avoid generating an error msg for optional constructs.  I'll bet that  
would work.  cool.

ok.  Assume we can use the same mechanism for all decisions.  It  
still seems &quot;wrong&quot; to gen a separate DFA for (COMMA ID)*.  We would  
want:

while ( LA(1)== COMMA ) {
   match(COMMA);
   match(ID);
}

Perhaps I should special case only the blocks that are LL(1) and have  
a single alternative.

As for speed, it looks like a method call is not that bad.  Running  
the java parser on jdk 1.4.2 source, yields 4,762,276 decisions which  
would mean that many method calls.  Running a spin loop around a  
method call that is probably not inlined:

         public int count(int f) {
                 return f+1;
         }

yields the following speed in compiled mode:

/tmp $ java SpinCall 4762276
25ms

Naturally, this may perform differently in the actual java parser so  
I added an extra method call to this bogus method:

     int c = 0;
     int n = 0;
     public int foo(IntStream input) {
         return c++;
     }

to *every* decision in the parser.  Parsing/lexing went from 3082ms/ 
1341 to 3145/1400.  That is 3%/5% increase.  So, not that much cost  
for a big improvement in regularity.

Anybody want to comment?

Ter

<PRE>Andy,

Thanks for your comment. This is very similar to how I do it - by manually
overriding the default AST behaviour. I hoped this could be done in the
grammar file somehow. I guess it could not.

</I>Yes, I think this could be done. I replace C++ operator overloading with
Java function calls as part of my C++ to Java translator (jazillian.com),
which is a little different but related.
Say you're creating a binary &quot;+&quot; operator between two Money objects like
this. You'd parse the source files into ASTs, search the ASTs for binary &quot;+&quot;

operators, and then
figure out the types of the left and right ASTs. If they're both type Money,
then this is the thing you're looking for, and you could replace the &quot;+&quot;
node in the AST by something else, such as some METHOD_CALL type of node.

Print out your modified AST, and you've just used ANTLR as a preprocessor to
convert operator overloading to code without operator overloading. In that
way, your &quot;money1 + money2&quot; expressions would become &quot;money1.plus(money2)&quot;.

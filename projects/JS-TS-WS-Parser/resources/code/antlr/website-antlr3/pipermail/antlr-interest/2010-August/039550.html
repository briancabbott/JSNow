<PRE>Dear all,

I am fairly confident that gUnit is broken. I have tests which fail in
gUnit but not in any test rig I set up myself.

If this list is not the right place to report this then please tell
me. Also, if you know, what is the right place?

The concrete cases I have are a problem with strings which are
manipulated in the Lexer by a function I wrote and seemingly incorrect
parsing of expressions.

The first I already sent to this list. I didn't get an answer on that
so either no one knew the answer or if they did they didn't have time
to reply.

The second is a little more serious and makes gUnit unusable to me.

Basically an expression of the form:

'a' + 'b'

which should work as string concatenation seems to fail in gUnit.
Stepping through the code shows that only 'a' is actually being parsed
which leads to an InvalidInputException.

However, in my own test rig it parses correctly. Also the gUnit tests
on the parser grammar (as opposed to the tree grammar) parses it to
the tree (fragment) that I expect. Only in the tests on the tree does
it seem to fail.

If I cannot trust gUnit in these cases how can I trust it in other cases?

Has any one else seen this problem? Is it possible I am doing something wrong?

mvg,
Jasper

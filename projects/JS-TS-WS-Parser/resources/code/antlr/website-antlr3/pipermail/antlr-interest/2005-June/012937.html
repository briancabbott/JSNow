<PRE>I am trying to use Antlr with Python.  I have a Windoze box that does not 
have Make or any compilers.  I don't have Java or C#, nor do I wish to use 
them.

I used a .msi file to install a binary on my system.  In the lib directory 
is a file called antlr.py, which looks like it should be the program.  But I 
cannot seem to use it.  Can I create my parser files using:

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>python antlr.py test.g
</I>...which should spit out the parser, lexer, etc.?

If so, what is the secret to doing this?  It seems that if I build from 
source on my computer, something like that may work, but as I said, I cannot 
do that.  I don't understand the Python examples because it looks like you 
need Make in order to use them.

If this is not possible, then what exactly is the purpose of the file 
antlr.py?

Thanks,
gevans

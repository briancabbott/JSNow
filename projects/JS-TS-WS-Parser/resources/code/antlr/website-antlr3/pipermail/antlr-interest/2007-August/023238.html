<PRE>Interesting.

Then what would the difference between a list and a vector be?

Personally, I thought that vector would do what you describe.  That  
things would move up in the container as items were deleted.

The reason I thought that list would supported persistent IDs is that  
the list routines are built on top of Jim's hash table routines.

If that's the case, then one way to fix list to handle persistent IDs  
would be to use an increasing integer value as the key, supplied by  
list add(), to the hash routine.  Right now, it uses the size of the  
hash, which means it can decrease when items are deleted, causing  
keys to collide.

This is how I solved it.  I stopped using the list routines and just  
created a hash with an integer key that increased each time I called  
add().

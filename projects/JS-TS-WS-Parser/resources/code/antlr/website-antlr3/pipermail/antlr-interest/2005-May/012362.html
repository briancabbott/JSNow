</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">bounces at antlr.org</A>] On Behalf Of Terence Parr
</I>&gt;<i> Sent: Sunday, May 29, 2005 12:46 PM
</I>&gt;<i> To: ANTLR Interest
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [antlr-interest] submission of patches, fixes, other
</I>&gt;<i> contributions
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Howdy,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the old days, public domain was the most generous license to use
</I>&gt;<i> for software.  Oddly enough, now it's not good at all.  I think a
</I>
Not odd at all.  Try doing a search on &quot;public domain copyright law&quot;.  The
legal consensus is that works published after 1978 cannot be made public
domain before 70 years after the last author dies.
[&lt;<A HREF="http://www.copyright.cornell.edu/training/Hirtle_Public_Domain.htm">http://www.copyright.cornell.edu/training/Hirtle_Public_Domain.htm</A>&gt; puts
works between 1978 and 1989 as being transiently in the public domain (until
the author claims copyright), but that is the exception.]

&gt;<i> large company with 3 letters in their name has emailed me like 4
</I>&gt;<i> times from different groups asking if I have a certification from
</I>&gt;<i> every contributor of patches over the last 15 years that they had the
</I>&gt;<i> right to submit the patch and that they granted me a license etc...
</I>&gt;<i> You get the picture.  Basically, nobody wants to use software anymore
</I>&gt;<i> that could include stolen work etc...
</I>
It isn't so much stolen work, I suspect, as it is work for which someone
could capriciously decide to sue because they changed their mind about &quot;PD&quot;
status.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Going forward, I must ask that people submit everything through the
</I>&gt;<i> website, which will track everything and have a &quot;contributor's
</I>&gt;<i> license&quot; agreement etc...  It just asks that you certify you created
</I>&gt;<i> whatever you're sending in and give me license to do whatever I want
</I>&gt;<i> with it.  Here is my tentative language (in the box at the bottom):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/misc/feedback">http://www.antlr.org/misc/feedback</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Comments on the language and/or issues?
</I>
It doesn't explicitly mention copyright.  I expect the language should state
the the person agreeing is the copyright holder for the contribution.  Also,
talk to your legal people at USF.  You don't have &quot;deep pockets&quot;, but USF
does, and you could be exposing the University to potential lawsuits for
employing you.  [Contribution author sues user; user sues USF.]  This is
very murky water; talk to a lawyer.  If the USF lawyers can't give you good
advice, try giving someone on the UCB law faculty a call.

It may be my imagination, but it seems that we're seeing this sort of 
question a lot lately, and I think it betrays a misunderstanding of 
what a tool like ANTLR can or should be able to do.

ANTLR is a tool for writing _recognizers_ for formally specified 
grammars, not a complete tool for writing compilers, translators or 
interpreters.

In other words, trying to encode the procedural semantics of your 
language using only ANTLR and furthermore doing this in a single pass 
without producing an intermediate representation of the program that 
was decoded during the parsing phase is really not a good idea, to the 
extent it's even possible.

For sufficiently simple translation or transliteration tasks, a 
single-pass ANTLR (or yacc or Javacc, etc.) parser that builds no 
intermediate representation of the input might be feasible. But to 
actually implement some kind of execution model or anything that 
requires information to propagate from one part of the input to another 
(e.g., a language with declarations) really is not something that can 
be done without building an internal representation of the input.

Rather than try to avoid building an AST or some other representation, 
you should just acknowledge that this extra step will make the rest of 
your job a lot easier.

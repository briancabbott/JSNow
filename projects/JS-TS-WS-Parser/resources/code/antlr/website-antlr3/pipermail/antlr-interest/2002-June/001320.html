<PRE>Hi,

Touche ;) I was a bit overbearing I guess sorry.

&gt;<i> so I speak only for Java environments. My Ant task

</I>&gt;<i> if dates are wrong, it invokes ANTLR again. So it avoids all unnecessary

</I>
Ack, basically the same as make but with C++ it goes wrong on touching the
generated header file for the parser.

&gt;<i> By the way, you can do the same in PreservingFileWriter; you have all
</I>&gt;<i> information required about supergrammars, imported files and generated files
</I>&gt;<i> collected during grammar analysis by ANTLR.
</I>
In theory yes.. only making it work in the current codebase makes me less
enthousiastic. This info is basically non existent at the moment the
filewriter is created.

&gt;<i> &gt; Makefile's allow me to do things in a very flexible way and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for as far as Makefile syntax can be cryptic it certainly beats XML
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just incidentally, the next incarnation of Ant (Ant 2) will be independent
</I>&gt;<i> of XML or other particular encoding, which I think it's a step in the right
</I>&gt;<i> direction.
</I>
I'll most certainly will have a look at it again.

&gt;<i> &gt; If I look at compilation times then running antlr is probably less than 1%
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the time to compile the generated files (and without minimal remakes,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this probably will go into the 0.001% (okay I may be exagerating here..
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it means that I would get lethal doses of caffeine)). My educated guess is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that in very few projects antlr's runtime is the biggest factor. So I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inclined to keep this thing the default. (if someone provides a 'clean'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; patch I would not dream of objecting though)
</I>
&gt;<i> You are probably right about times, it's more a psychological factor (&lt;RANT&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> against improvements that make things slower &lt;/RANT&gt;).
</I>
Mwoch together with the use of the extra buffering added in 2.7.2aX it will
probably even out ;) Win some lose some.

&gt;<i> And it's my inability to get grammars right from the first time that makes
</I>&gt;<i> me ANTLR them several times before having something to compile ;-) Or maybe
</I>&gt;<i> it's because those damned temporary files were making the Ant unit tests to
</I>&gt;<i> fail from time to time, and it took us two days to figure what's happening
</I>&gt;<i> :-))
</I>
It sometimes makes you wonder if a pencil and paper is more advanced than a
computer :) And we poor software developers are basically only outthere
frustrating ourselves (and eachother) ;)

&gt;<i> Anyway, I can live with it as default behavior.
</I>
We'll see what Terence cooks up with the new codegeneration stuff. And see
if we can squirrel setting a different printwriter away in it.

Cheers,

Ric

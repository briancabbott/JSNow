<PRE>I have been looking at doing this for VS2005 and ANTLR3 itself -
basically creating the excellent ANTLRWorks environment within VS2005. 

As far as I have looked in to this, it seems that integrating a parser
built with ANTLR (2 or 3) would be the least of the work - at most you
might need a wrapper C++ class to make the calls into the parser conform
to the VS studio requirements. Incidentally, the VS2005 integration
seems a lot easier to work with than VS 2003 .Net.

I thought it might be useful, and relatively easy, to generate a C++
wrapper for integration of any parser into VS2005 with the C codegen of
ANTLR3, and I would presume that should he feel inclined to do the same,
that Ric would have an easier time with the C++ codegen than I will from
C codegen.

Sorry that I can't be more specific but I have thus far only looked into
how feasible this is and decided that it is eminently so, but yet a fair
amount of work. It is on my list of cool things to do with ANTLR though
;-)

Subject: [antlr-interest] Has anybody ever tried to integrate with VS?

Hi All

I want to build a new language integration tool for VS2005. I want to 
integrate Latex into VS (I'm lazy, I'm spoiled and I need my code 
complete thingies ;-). However to do that I need a parser and a lexer. 
The documents assume you use Flex and Bison, however I was thinking 
about Antlr. So now my questions are:

1) Has anybody ever build a language package for VS with antlr
2) Has anybody ever created a LaTex grammar?
3) Has anybody ever tried to create those two things.

Also if anybody has any hints or tips I would love to hear those

Regards

Patrick

<PRE>Craig,

 

As I always like to expend my knowledge, do you have a &quot;recipe&quot; for
building it?

We were able to produce the jar file after some minor tweaking, but I am
short on how to actually make it executable.

 

Thanks again,

 

Eric.

Hi Eric,

 

I have two executable versions I have built.

I have one native exe, built with gcj, and one compiled to MSIL using
ikvm.

 

I could mail them to you if you can receive mail messages of around
three megabytes in size (each).

 

Maybe Terrence is keen to provide a download though?

 

Cheers

Craig

Hi everyone,

 

We have been trying to compile 2.7.6 as a standalone exe file for
windows without any success.

Has anyone done that successfully?

We are using the 2.7.5 version posted on the website last year for now,
but we would love to use 2.7.6.

We have .Net 1.1 and 2.0 on all our build environment if that helps.

 

Thanks,

 

Eric.

<PRE>Hi,
&#160; I keep getting following errors:

warning(138): Query.g:0:0: grammar Query: no start rule (no rule can obviously be followed by EOF)
warning(200): Query.g:27:40: Decision can match input such as &quot;OR&quot; using multiple alternatives: 1, 2
As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input
warning(200): Query.g:31:39: Decision can match input such as &quot;AND&quot; using multiple alternatives: 1, 2
As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input
warning(200): Query.g:39:7: Decision can match input such as &quot;WORD&quot; using multiple alternatives: 1, 2
As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input

&#160; I kind of understand why because if the input is &quot;OR&quot; the parser will just freak out. What I want do is a simple boolean query input validator

(1) valid input:
a OR b
c AND d
a OR b AND d

(2) invalid input:
a AND&#160; 
AND b (This is not working)

What's wrong with the grammer? I really cannot figure it out.

Thanks !

<PRE>Hello,

I've found the following bugs in the generated parser (C target):

1. This is the most annoying problem because I cannot solve it any
other way. My tree grammar is:
function:	^(Function ^(DatabaseObject Nil COUNT) countArgument) -&gt;
^(Function[$COUNT.text] countArgument);

The excerpt from generated code for this is:
pANTLR3_BASE_TREE root_1 = (pANTLR3_BASE_TREE)(ADAPTOR-&gt;nilNode(ADAPTOR));
root_1 = (pANTLR3_BASE_TREE)(ADAPTOR-&gt;becomeRoot(ADAPTOR,
    (pANTLR3_BASE_TREE)ADAPTOR-&gt;createTypeText(ADAPTOR, Function,
(pANTLR3_UINT8)(COUNT162-&gt;getText(COUNT162))), root_1));

The COUNT162-&gt;getText(COUNT162) function returns pANTLR3_STRING which
is casted to pANTLR3_UINT8??? When I manually change the code to:
root_1 = (pANTLR3_BASE_TREE)(ADAPTOR-&gt;becomeRoot(ADAPTOR,
    (pANTLR3_BASE_TREE)ADAPTOR-&gt;createTypeText(ADAPTOR, Function,
(pANTLR3_UINT8)(COUNT162-&gt;getText(COUNT162)-&gt;chars)), root_1));

it works as expected.

2. My tree grammar doesn't do a lot. Because of that I wanted to
switch on rewriting (options {rewrite = true;}). But the generated
parser was not able to be compiled. Some variables were not defined,
getParent() function was called on ADAPTOR which doesn't contain
anything similar etc. (when I generated Java parser from that grammar
it was compiled correctly)

3. The wildcard is not working for the C target! I reported that here
already that there was no response. So once more. My tree grammar is
similar to:
func:    ^(FUNC arg=.) -&gt; ^(Function $arg);

When I try to generate a parser a crazy error message appears that a
template rewriteWildcardLabelRef.st cannot be found. (again, for Java
everything works as expected)

Best regards,
Tomas

<PRE>Dear friends,

I would like to ask you for the hale, or rather for the advice. 
What would you do if you were me ?
I'm Andrew, 27 yers old, from Poland.

Recently I've received the job proposition in the fondation (no meter 
the name) which activity is 
financed by the European Union and some athers french fondations. The 
job would be in the accounitng and administration of this fondation.
This fondation brings help (medical) in some regions in Russia 
sinistrated by the war or the natural catalclisms.
Actually the bring attention in the region of Ingushetia. My work 
will consist on accounting and financial affairs in Poland 
(supervision of financial flow from Eu and France)
and especially in the administrative domaine. The problem is that in 
Russia this humanitar help has already been developped to the 
significant level - it must be well controled - especially 
the trafic of documents must be specified (and controled), some 
internal procedures must be created, I will be responsible of 
external contacts wiyh some russian institutions (especially with the 
Russian Ministry of helth).
My hesitation comes from the fact that I will have to be in place 
(will share my time between Warsaw - Moscow - Ingushetia), wille be 
there 3 weeks a month - the forth weej of the month will be completly 
for me (kind of compensation).
Place of work - Shared between Warsaw, Moscow amd Ingoushetia. Warsaw 
(the city where I'm living), Moscow (it's wanderfull city - I would 
like to see it); but Ingushetia - I'm &quot;a little&quot; affraid. Having the 
frontiere with Tchechenia, it's seems to dangerous.
I'm aslo afraid of this system 3/1 - it can perturbate my private 
live - it's really diffucult to led my life nirmally.

&gt;&gt;<i>From the other hand it can be the great opportunity to survive 
</I>something interesting - Travel, meet people and gain some 
professional experience and earn some maney (it's good paid).
It isn't for a long time (max for some years 3-4)

Actually I'm on unemplyement, will probably start an ather job 1st 
march - but nothing interesting and bad paid (with the same 
perspectives in the future).

So what do you thing ?
Please send me all your commentaries, is it worth or no.
I would be especially freatfull for the answers from people living in 
Russia (Russian).

Thanks Andrew
PS You can answer me in french or english

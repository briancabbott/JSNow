<PRE>Hi, Jim,

On Wed, Mar 3, 2010 at 2:36 AM, Jim Idle &lt;<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">jimi at temporal-wave.com</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> Your points are well taken, but there are some misunderstandings here. I have tried to say on a number of occasions that the string factory thing coming from $xyz.text is just a convenience thing that should not be used in any environment that requires performance/memory efficiency. It is just a reasonable way to access the pointers and stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, look guys, this is C!! By which I mean, for real efficiency, you should be accessing things such as the text of the token via the pointers in the token and not via the artifice of $text.
</I>
Thanks for this tip! By replacing

    std::string id( $IDENTIFIER.text-&gt;chars )

with

    pANTLR3_COMMON_TOKEN token = $IDENTIFIER;
    ANTLR3_MARKER start = token-&gt;getStartIndex(token);
    ANTLR3_MARKER end = token-&gt;getStopIndex(token);
    std::string id( (const char *)start, end-start+1 );

I see another 3-fold decrease in memory usage. In combination with the
bounded lookahead stream and token factory, this brings the memory
usage of my ANTLR 3 C parser roughly in line the ANTLR 2.7 C++ version
(it's still ~40% faster).

&gt;<i> In the next release I will document this better and I apologize for not having done so up to press. There are also lots of macros and switches you can set that will improve performance a lot, and the upcoming release has lots of performance improvements. For comparison, I am currently working on a parser for IBM that is 7X faster than the 2.7.x C++ equivalent. Once again, I apologize for not documenting all of this stuff as well as it might be, but the code itself is well documented; there just needs to be more usage docs I think.
</I>
This is intriguing. Could you point to a few of the important settings
I should be looking at?

Regards,
Chris

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://markmail.org/message/jfngdd2ci6h7qrbo">http://markmail.org/message/jfngdd2ci6h7qrbo</A>) suggesting the most

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> go; then, the parsing rules slow to a crawl because the token buffer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is sitting on all the memory.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wonder if there is a way to change fillBuffer()'s behavior, so that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it will only lex some bounded number of tokens before allowing parsing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to proceed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a partial solution to this problem. To be clear, the issue is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The default token stream implementation tokenizes the entire input
</I>&gt;<i> on the first call to LT().
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The default token factory never de-allocates tokens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since a token structure is more than 100 bytes, large inputs can
</I>&gt;<i> easily consume multiple GB before parsing even begins. (This is in the
</I>&gt;<i> C back-end. I don't know about other back-ends.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The solution consists of:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. A token stream implementation that tokenizes up to a fixed lookahead limit.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. A token factory that pre-allocates a fixed number of tokens,
</I>&gt;<i> recycling old tokens when new ones are requested.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This seems to be a sound strategy, so long as the input grammar has an
</I>&gt;<i> known lookahead limit and the allocation pool is sufficiently large.
</I>&gt;<i> My grammar is LL(2), and a lookahead limit of 2 with a token pool of 8
</I>&gt;<i> tokens works just fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using this implementation, I'm able to parse the above-mentioned 39MB
</I>&gt;<i> input file using less than 700MB memory, a more than 5-fold
</I>&gt;<i> improvement on the defaults (as an added benefit, the parser actually
</I>&gt;<i> terminated after 45s and didn't completely lock my system!). The
</I>&gt;<i> parser is about 40% faster than an equivalent ANTLR 2.7 parser using
</I>&gt;<i> the C++ back-end, but still uses about 5 times as much memory. The
</I>&gt;<i> remaining excess memory usage seems to be due to the default string
</I>&gt;<i> factory implementation, which also doesn't seem to ever release memory
</I>&gt;<i> once allocated. This is a much more complex beast and I'm hesitant to
</I>&gt;<i> tackle it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If anybody is interested in using this code, I'm willing to clean it
</I>&gt;<i> up and share it with the community. Please feel free to contact me.

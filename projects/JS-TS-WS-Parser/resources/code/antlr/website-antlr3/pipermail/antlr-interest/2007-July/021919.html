<PRE>It is very difficult read these messages and just forgets it and move
directly to trash!

Most of people are learning and exchanging knowledge through this
list; It is amazing that a person ask for more than that (for free!)
and use this list for it!

We have a great book available and a great people exchanging info here
- what else is necessary? More docs? The Terr's book is wonderful ,
during the read we know that he wrote that with passion to disseminate
knowledge, and had careful to make the book accessible for everyone!

Now a days I use v3 in my day by day&#8230; and reading these messages I'm
feeling a bit embarrassed and even need to ask for apologies to not
contribute more to this great software...

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I know how you feel. I even bought the book and was pretty

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it's all about managing expectations. ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For starters I had no idea that there would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; absolutely no information about non-Java targets, it's hard to use as
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> there was a serious space issue. I went like 100 pages over their

</I>&gt;<i> figured that should be in the wiki.  The javadoc is up for some
</I>&gt;<i> targets already too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a reference because much of it is treated as a tutorial, there is no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tutorial or reference for the runtime library, there's no specific
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discussion of differences between v2 and v3,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> on the wiki
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no complete grammar file
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in chapter 3
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> you mean other than the complete grammar syntax I put in there?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... I could go on. (mind you, there is a lot of useful
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information despite these problems.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's all about how much I could cram in there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Still, I think it's a general problem in the computer field that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; authors of the most useful projects, i.e. open-source projects, have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trouble getting paid anything for their work. The government, and most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; social institutions, have provided no means of making money except
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; selling copies of something. This is very unfortunate, because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; e-copies cost nothing to make and logically should be free, but I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't think you can blame Ter for it. It's a limitation of our
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Money makes me spend a lot more time on it than I would for free
</I>&gt;<i> doc.  Why should a book be free just because my marginal cost to
</I>&gt;<i> produce is $0?  The value is in the content not the medium.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; society's institutions. He could give away the PDF, but I think the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; truth is, it would hurt book sales. Don't be mad at Ter just because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there are more generous people out there who give away all their hard
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work for little or nothing in return.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are you really saying that devoting 20 years of my life to make the
</I>&gt;<i> best tools possible is not generous?  You kidding me?  others are
</I>&gt;<i> more generous?  You've got to be kidding me.  People swoop in and
</I>&gt;<i> built a few patches or whatever and then move on.  Rare few start
</I>&gt;<i> building something of value and keep honing it. How many people do
</I>&gt;<i> you know that have been dedicated to free software for as long as I
</I>&gt;<i> have?  I am working on the doc and you can help add more doc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I get $3 measly dollars when you buy the book at amazon.  I want all
</I>&gt;<i> you whiners about the doc to either decide you can't use the tool
</I>&gt;<i> because it's not well documented enough or suck it up and start
</I>&gt;<i> helping out.  Most of the whiners are freeloaders....complaining, but
</I>&gt;<i> never having contributed themselves to open source or ANTLR before.
</I>&gt;<i> Bunch of ungrateful freeloaders...how dare you make these demands!

<PRE>Hi Anthony,
 
Thanks for your input to this, it's been doing my head in!
 
Indeed, I've got the following worked out so far:

options {
 exportVocab=PVocab;
 k=3;
filter=AMP;
}
 
protected
AMP
//an &amp; and line break.
 :  '&amp;' '\r' '\n' {System.out.println(&quot;&amp; HIT!&quot;);newline();}
 ; 
 
STRING_LITERAL
// string literals - the only token that can be split with an '&amp;'.
options {paraphrase = &quot;a string&quot;;}
 : '&quot;'! (~('&quot;'))* '&quot;'!
 ;
 
This solves the first problem very well but the second point is that I still want the STRING_LITERAL token to be passed as one token, even when it's been split over 2 or more lines.
 
ie:
 
getrec(tag,&quot;select * from acct,x__ir &amp;
where acct001 = x__ir001 and &amp;
x__ir006 = 'V'&quot;)
 
Effectively I need the 3 lines of strings to be treated as 1 single STRING_LITERAL token, eg:
 
getrec(tag,&quot;select * from acct,x__ir where acct001 = x__ir001 and x_ir006 = 'V'&quot;)
 
and unfortuately shaving the last 3 characters wouldn't always work.
 
Again many thanks for your help,
 
Cheers
 
Craig

	Okay.
	 
	Define a lexer rule as '&amp;' 'linefeed', and mark it with token type &quot;skip&quot;. That should get round your original continuation line problem (unless you can split in the middle of a token). I do note you say you've solved this, though ...
	 
	And look at the example in the manual of lexing ESCape characters inside of a character string. You'll probably need a different lexer rule (almost identical to the one above, though). But if this rule is triggered inside a string, you want to finish it with something like &quot;token.setlength( token.getlength() - 3)&quot; which will lose the &amp;\r\n that's just been added ...
	 
	Cheers,
	Wol

	Hi Folks,
	 
	I have a small problem that, although trawling all the manuals, examples etc, i can't find an example of (although i'm sure i've read about it somewhere!).
	 
	I'm trying to analyse a language where each statement appears on a single line, apart from when the '&amp;' character is explicitly used as a line continuation character. 
	 
	A statement like:
	 
	and(a&gt;1,b&lt;2) can also be written
	 
	and (a&gt;1,&amp;
	b&lt;2)
	 
	The only other issue is that a string token can actually be validly split by '&amp; \r \n' so we may have:
	 
	and(a&gt;&quot;abc&quot;,b&lt;&quot;def&quot;)
	 
	written as:
	 
	and(a&gt;&quot;abc&quot;,b&lt;&quot;d&amp;
	ef&quot;)
	 
	 
	I've tried using a lexer filter and that works fine for the first example but either i'm incorrectly using it in the second example or as the lexer will already be partway through lexing the string (done as per the default java grammer in the distro.) it cannot invoke the filter rule.
	 
	Is the best way of dealing with this a change in the lexing class to automatically filter out any '&amp;\r\n''s from the character stream before it hits the lexer?
	 
	If there's another way or if anyone can point me to an example I would be most grateful.
	 
	Many thanks
	 
	Craig

<PRE>We're developing several SQL parsers for different major DBMS, before 3.1b1 was available, we finished development based 3.0.1, and run a bunch of *.sql files with a great amout of SQL statements againt this parser. Everything went well at that time.

Then when 3.1b1 was available, we switched to it with exactly the same grammar code, and run the same *sql files. Something different happened, all *.sql files start with empty line or lines, SQL comment line or lines, could not pass the test. Now when 3.1 available, the situation is the same as that of 3.1b1. And I learnt that if the file start with lexers with HIDDEN channel, it would fail against the test. 

I wonder if anyone else ever comes across the same situtation? And if yes, any suggestion to solve it?

By the way, I am using the C target.
Thanks!

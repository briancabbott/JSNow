Ok, the funny thing is that there are no other rules at all. I made a  
lexer with that single rule in it because I was trying to figure out  
what it did under the covers... Given that no ambiguity is possible  
with only one rule, I wonder if ANTLR has a hard-coded response to  
lexer rules like &quot;.+&quot;...

The thing which motivated me to start exploring this was a set of  
questions about lexer precedence (by which I mean, how the lexer  
chooses which rules to try) and I had a set of rules which looked  
something like this:

WS : ' '+ ;
FOO : ~('x' | 'y' | 'z')+ ;

At first I mistakenly thought that the lexer would try lexer rules in  
order (WS first and then FOO), but it doesn't. It calls a predict  
method and the predication always goes for FOO without fail. My  
understanding is now that the prediction method favors a greedy  
match, and so even typing &quot;     \n&quot; into the test rig is enough to  
make it prefer FOO over WS (because of the trailing newline). I  
played around with greedy=false but that yielded single characters  
rather than a string of non-whitespace characters. In any case,  
exploring the issue I eventually got down to a minimal lexer  
containing that lone OTHER rule...

I still have a lot to learn about ANTLR lexers!

Cheers,
Wincent

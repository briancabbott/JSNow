<PRE>Harald:

It never ceases to amaze me how professional programmers who write code for
a living expect others to do it for free.

I imagine that Ter's motivation for writing Antlr is not money, but
personally, I hope he gets stinking filthy rich from the proceeds of his
book.  If Antlr were a commercial product, he'd probably be making a nice
living out of it. Tools like Antlr are very specialized things, and good
ones can command a hefty price tag.  But instead he's chosen to give it
away.  Some people appreciate that, sadly, others don't.

If I were Ter, I'm not sure my response to you would have been so cordial.
We all need to vent now and then, but I think you owe him an apology.

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">bounces at antlr.org</A>] On Behalf Of Harald Wellmann

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [antlr-interest] [v3] Lack of documentation
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Getting started with ANTLR v3 is a frustrating experience for its
</I>&gt;<i> lack of
</I>&gt;<i> coherent documentation and non-trivial example code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been using ANTLR since the good old times when it used to be
</I>&gt;<i> called
</I>&gt;<i> PCCTS, and I always used to be fond of it, but I am disappointed with
</I>&gt;<i> v3.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Marketing-style hype about the latest cool features does not really
</I>&gt;<i> help
</I>&gt;<i> when you get no little or no information on how to use them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Even v2 documentatation was a bit scarce, it always cost you some
</I>&gt;<i> trial and
</I>&gt;<i> error to get things right, but this was bliss compared to the
</I>&gt;<i> scattered and
</I>&gt;<i> incomplete bits of documentation you get for v3.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I know there's a book now. And no, I don't think it's in the
</I>&gt;<i> spirit of
</I>&gt;<i>  a successful open source project to hide all relevant information in
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> book that is only available commercially.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's nothing wrong about books, but you can publish a book and
</I>&gt;<i> still
</I>&gt;<i> make the information publicly available, see e.g. the Subversion
</I>&gt;<i> Book.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, even this mailing list is inaccessible to most people in
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> corporate IT environment, as the Mailman Frontend is running on a
</I>&gt;<i> non-standard port 8080 which tends to get blocked by firewalls.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Harald

<PRE>Hello,
 
I agree in principle with Jose's suggestion (though I think templates
are using a sledge hammer to crack a nut!). 
 
My approach in CPP_parser was to sub-class my application code to keep
it separate from the parsing code. This is quite easy to do, though it
still requires function calls from the .g file via CPPParser.cpp etc.
which can be controlled by #if statements. It is quite easy then to
remove my application code from the parser .g file by deleting these
#if blocks to enable the parser to be used by someone else for
different purposes. Don't forget that most application code will be
buried *somewhere inside* their  productions.
 
Anyone interested in doing this for other languages can look at my
ReadMe text. CPP_parser is coded in C++.
 
David Wigg.

Hi,

One thing that could be cleaned up in ANTLR (in my opinion), is mixing
grammar
definition with custom parsing logic. I mean, in ANTLR you can write
code to
execute whenever a rule, an alternative or a pattern matches the
input. Such
logic can be used to direct the parser or to do anything else.
That makes the .g itself coupled with the language the custom code is
and the
output of antlr.Tool.
There's no clean separation between the rules describing the grammar
and the
custom parsing logic.
Also, it makes reusing grammars more difficult than it should. You
start from
a grammar and modify it to suit your needs, but whenever the grammar
you
started from changes you need to apply the changes to your branched
grammar.

Shouldn't be better to separate the ANTLR flow into two steps?

1) You provide a .g file and the desired language the parser will be
implemented in. ANTLR would then generate the lexer and/or parser in
the
target language, as it does currently.
2) From the .g file, ANTLR also generates an interface and an no-op
implementation declaring all the hooks the grammar accepts. The
generated API
would support an optional parameter allowing a different
implementation of
the interface.

I haven't thought too deep in this. I wouldn't like a Context object
back and
forth, but the potential interests me: get a standard set of official
ANTLR
grammars ready-to-use with no source-level changes.
It makes ANTLR less coupled to Java as well.

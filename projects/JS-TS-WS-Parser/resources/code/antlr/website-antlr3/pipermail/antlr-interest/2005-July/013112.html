Just to clarify:

you create 'first' on the stack; you then add 150K siblings. When main 
terminates, the destructor for 'first' is called. This deletes the first 
AST node, but it first has to delete the 'right' field (ie. the 
sibling). Before deleting sibling, we have to delete the second sibling, 
and so on; the delete is therefore recursive. This is necessary because 
you have to decrement a reference count before deciding whether or not 
to delete a node; this means that the process has to be top-down, rather 
than bottom-up. The overflow you're seeing is simply the call stack for 
the recursive destruction. I checked this in valgrind, which shows that 
your test has a negligible stack until the end of the program, when it 
suddenly explodes to 20MB.

If you need to fix this, change your 'first' declaration to:

RefCommonAST *first = new RefCommonAST( new CommonAST());

so that the tree isn't deleted on program exit.

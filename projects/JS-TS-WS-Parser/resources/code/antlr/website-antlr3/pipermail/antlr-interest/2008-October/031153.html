<PRE>LDTA: Workshop on Language Descriptions Tools and Applications

===Call For Papers 2009===

This is the Call For Papers for the Ninth Workshop on Language
Descriptions, Tools and Applications (LDTA 2009)

LDTA is a two-day satellite event of ETAPS which takes on the 28th and
29th of March 2009 in York, England.

==Scope==

LDTA is an application and tool oriented forum on meta programming in
a broad sense. A meta program is a program that takes other programs
as input or output. The focus of LDTA is on generated or otherwise
efficiently implemented meta programs, possibly using high level
descriptions of programming languages. Tools and techniques presented
at LDTA are usually applicable in the context of &quot;Language
Workbenches&quot; or &quot;Meta Programming Systems&quot; or simply as parts of
advanced programming environments or IDEs. The applications areas
include, but are not limited to:
* Program analysis, transformation, generation and verification
* Implementation of Domain Specific Languages (both visual and textual)
* Reverse engineering and reengineering
* Refactoring and other source-to-source transformations
* Application modelling (MDE, MDA, Software Factories, Software  
product lines)
* Grammar engineering / Grammarware
* Language definition and language prototyping
* Debugging, profiling and testing
* IDE construction
* Compiler construction

LDTA is a well-established workshop next to other conferences and
workshops on (programming) language engineering topics such as SLE and
GPCE.LDTA is traditionally a forum where computer science theories are
put to the test of real-world software engineering issues, for example
by applying:

* context-free grammars to parser generation for real programming  
languages,
* attribute grammars to static analyzer and compiler generation,
* term rewriting to source-to-source transformation,
* action semantics to programming language implementation,
* model checking to software verification.

Note that LDTA solicits submissions from any technological or
theoretical domain, as long as the paper is within the application
scope.

==Submission Procedure and Publication==

Submissions in the following categories are admissible:
* research papers,
* tool papers,
* experience papers

The final versions of accepted papers will probably(*) be published in
Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS), Elsevier
Science, and will be made available during the workshop. (*)Due to
organizational changes at Elsevier, publication by ENTCS publication
is provisional; another comparable venue will be found otherwise.

Each submission must:
* clearly and unambiguously state in which of the three categories it  
falls
* be original, i.e. not published or submitted elsewhere,
* contain a clear motivation,
* contain a thorough analysis of the claimed contributions (for
example by comparing to related work),
* be written in less than 15 pages (research papers and experience
reports), or less than 10 pages (tool papers)
* use the ENTCS style.

The authors of each submission are required to give a presentation at
LDTA 2009. The authors of the tool papers are required to include an
interactive demonstration in their presentations.

The authors of the best papers will be invited to write a journal
version of their paper which will be separately reviewed and, assuming
acceptance, be published in journal form. As in past years, this will
be done in a special issue devoted to LDTA 2009 of the journal Science
of Computer Programming (Elsevier Science).

The authors of the best tool papers will be invited to write a paper
and submit the source of code of their tool, which will both be
separately reviewed and, assuming acceptance, be published in the
special issue on Experimental Software and Toolkits (EST) of the
journal Science of Computer Programming (Elsevier Science).

Please submit your abstract and paper using

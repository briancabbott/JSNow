Hi,

Good! :)

&gt;<i> Now that I have had a look at it, I am beginning to wonder: the

</I>&gt;<i> parser or treeparser in particular. 
</I>
Think you're right there. Hmmm. I guess you're te first to notice. I never
much needed the sections and always split lexer/parser/treeparser so I've
never run into it myself. Other than a bug in the antlr parser with respect
to them.

&gt;<i> The ANTLR manual as it is did 
</I>&gt;<i> seem to acknowledge that impression. So if I have a file with both a 
</I>&gt;<i> lexer and a parser, a named header section will be added to both 
</I>&gt;<i> generated classes, that is: the same named header. If you do 
</I>&gt;<i> anything else than including headers in such a header section (for 
</I>&gt;<i> instance, defining auxillary classes or functions, or global 
</I>&gt;<i> variables) it will result in duplicated code.
</I>
Not pretty indeed. Would require some shoveling around of code to fix. Move
the hashmap with the action tokens from the behavior class to the grammar
subclasses (if I recall right on the last one)

&gt;<i> So would we need to put a warning in the manual sections on Cpp and 
</I>&gt;<i> Python runtime (don't know if C# uses those) that if you use named 
</I>&gt;<i> headers you'd better make separate grammar files for your lexer, 
</I>&gt;<i> parser and treeparser.
</I>
Or that...

&gt;<i> Alternatively, we can do some clever processing on the named header 
</I>&gt;<i> files (this is just a proposal). If I want a named 
</I>&gt;<i> section &quot;__init__&quot; - I'm going to the scheme devised for Python now -
</I>&gt;<i>  to be used only for the lexer class, I could provide a 
</I>&gt;<i> name &quot;&lt;LexerClassName&gt;.__init__&quot; for the header. In the case there 
</I>&gt;<i> is also a parser in the file, that would not get the code in this 
</I>&gt;<i> header section. By using the actual name of the class instead of a 
</I>&gt;<i> name &quot;lexer.__init__&quot; it would even be possible to address this 
</I>&gt;<i> issue with 2 lexer definitions in the .g file (if that is at all 
</I>&gt;<i> possible). 
</I>
2 lexers in one .g is not possible. Your idea will work I guess although
moving some stuff around might be prettier. Hmm might also need some fixing
in antlr.g.

Cheers,

Ric

yes. sorry. I got the cardinality on the right of the -&gt; wrong. it
should be (i think):

array: '[' FLOAT+ | STRING+ ']' -&gt; ^(ARRAY FLOAT* STRING* ) ;

because when specifying an array of floats, the list of FLOATs is full
the list of STRINGs is empty and so we must have STRING* on the right
hand side. similar reasoning for FLOAT*.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> array: '[' (t+=FLOAT)+ | (t+=STRING)+ ']' -&gt; ^(ARRAY $t+) ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [Andy - that doesn't work either. I don't get exceptions, but I get errors and non-sensical output]
</I>
not enough information here for me to be of any help to you, sorry. as
far as i recall this works in the Java target, maybe something is
different with the C# target. or more likely i have mis-remembered it...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> array
</I>&gt;<i>     : ( l='[' (f+=FLOAT)+  ']' -&gt; ^(ARRAY_FLOAT [&quot;FLT ARY&quot;,$l] $f+) )
</I>&gt;<i>     | ( l='[' (s+=STRING)+ ']' -&gt; ^(ARRAY_STRING[&quot;STR ARY&quot;,$l] $s+) )
</I>&gt;<i>   ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [Andy - This causes compiler errors, and I'm really not sure what you are getting at.
</I>
compiler errors are odd here, maybe the C# target does not support the [
] notation for initializing an imaginary token?

&gt;<i> i think this last form will simplify subsequent processing of the tree.
</I>&gt;<i> note also the proper initialization of the imaginary tokens.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [Andy - what do you mean &quot;proper initialization of the imaginary tokens&quot;]
</I>
the stuff between the [ ] on the right hand side of the -&gt; is
information used to initialize the imaginary token. in Java, they get
translated into parameters to its constructor. i refer you to Dr. Parr's
book to find out more about this feature.



seems like i probably wasn't very helpful to you after all, sorry about
that...

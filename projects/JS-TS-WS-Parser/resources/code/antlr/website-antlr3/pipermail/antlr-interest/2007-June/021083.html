Ok, interesting idea (I spose). Not come across this before.

Is there any reason why 99 was defined as the hidden channel rather than
stating default=1 and hidden=0. You've already stated that there is no
upper bound on the number of channels, so it would make more sense, I'd
say.

For example, when I was trying to define my specification for
ANTLR.Token, I originally thought that hidden=99, so I created:

   type Channel_Type is range 0 .. 99;
   
   Default_Channel : constant Channel_Type := Channel_Type'First;
   Hidden_Channel  : constant Channel_Type := Channel_Type'Last;

Which is wrong now I know ;)

Thanks,
Luke.

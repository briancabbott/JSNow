<PRE>Mike, and the list,

I see that I have to slightly correct my previous statements.

ANTLR v4 does have embedded actions so v3 grammars might not have to be 
as heavily re-factored as I suggested... however in my own heavily 
mulit-lingual project (Java, C, Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, ...) embedded 
actions have been a real pain, and I for one, want to avoid any embedded 
actions.

However, AST grammars no longer exist, so we will have to heavily 
re-code any AST grammars from v3 for any v4 port....

Regards,

Stephen Gaito

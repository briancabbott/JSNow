Actually, I held off my answer as I'm still writing up that discussion 
this very second. ;)

3.0 will have exactly this stack mechanism; &quot;remote attribution&quot; it was 
originally called.  We'll call it dynamic scoping of attributes and 
perhaps add a new twist.  I'll have something for you to read in a few 
hours.

As Loring say, however, anything can happen before the release ;)  I'm 
cranking away at the moment though because I'm very comfortable with 
the decisions I'm making given past experience (for example SORCERER 
had these stacked attributes).  It's only when we get into new stuff 
that I need to ponder stuff and get everybody's feedback/experience. :)

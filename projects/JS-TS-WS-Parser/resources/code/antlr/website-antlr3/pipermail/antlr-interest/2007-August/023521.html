</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think the current channel handling is something of a work in
progress. Currently the channel support is rather basic.
CommonTokenStream only allows a parser to read from one channel and
there doesn't appear to be any direct way to access off-channel
tokens.
You can override the channel for given token types, it looks like this
is primarily there to support the interpreter but you could use this
to put comment tokens back onto the default channel when you want to
process them. Or you could implement a subclass that processed
multiple channels rather than just one.
Though unless comment usage is rather restricted in your language you
probably want to keep them off-channel to avoid having to handle them
in the grammar which in a language where comments are allowed anywhere
would mean having &quot;comment*&quot; between all tokens in your grammar. You
can use CommonTokenStream.getTokens to get all tokens, possibly
restricted by token type, between given token indexes. Or you may want
to subclass CommonTokenStream and have a method to get all tokens on a
given channel between given indexes.

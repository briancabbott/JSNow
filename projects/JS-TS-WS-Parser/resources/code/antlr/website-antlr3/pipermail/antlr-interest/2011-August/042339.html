<PRE>I woke up this morning and realized what the problem was.  You can't access the &quot;tree&quot; member variable in filter_return directly because it's private.  So, I have to use getTree().  The return type for getTree() is a standard java Object.  However, I know it's a CommonTree (since that's what I specified in the parser definition).  So, I simply needed to cast the return to CommonTree.  CommonTree supports the toStringTree() and things now work as I wanted.  toStringTree() was coming up undefined because of the type of return for getTree() and that's what had me confused.

Thanks for your help

Scott

when using the ^ and/or ! meta-operators, the result tree is not created
until the end of the rule.

technically your printing action is not at the end of the rule because
stuff could appear after that action.

put your print code in the rule's @after{...} section and a reference to
the rulename.tree will not be null.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Isn't there a way to display the string of ASTs from the filter_return object? 
</I>&gt;<i> Scott Stanchfield's video would say you could do &quot;System.out.println(f.tree.getStringTree());&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> but that doesn't compile with Antlr 3.4.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I run the harness as I have it above, it simply prints &quot;=&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
the toString() method of CommonTree does not recurse into the tree's
children (if any). so that is why you see just the root node printed by
your driver.

need to use the toStringTree() method in your driver in order to get the
entire tree printed --- just as you did in your rule's printing action.

<PRE>The organization of this is a little different with the C runtime
because we don&#8217;t have objects and inheritance available. However, the
functionality is all there.

 

pANTRL3_BASE_TREE is always passed to everything, even if you have your
own tree node structures etc. However, within this, there is a pointer
to common tree and within there, there is a pointer that you can use to
point to your own structure (which must contain common tree, which must
contain base tree). So, to get the common tree associated with a base
tree, take the void * called &#8216;super&#8217; and cast it to the common tree node
typedef. You will see that all the structures have this &#8216;super&#8217; pointer,
which is used to point to any structure that is higher up the
organization chain (parent in object terms).

 

I can only think that the particular methods on the java common tree
node stream were implemented after I implemented this in C and somehow I
missed these additions. However, if you look at the C runtime code for
visitChild(), you will see that there is code to stack a current node
and restore a prior node. Hence, you can probably work out how to use
the inbuilt stack system to do what you need. I will make a note to see
when the push and pop were added and why I have not implemented them
yet.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Push/Pop for CommonTreeNodeStream in C runtime
target

 

Hi 

 

          I've written a simple parser/ast walker in Java which includes
loops (for/while) and conditional (if) statements. With help from the
mailing list; this was accomplished in the Java version by using the
Java runtime's CommonTreeNodeStream's push() and pop() methods... 

 

for e.g. see: 

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2007-March/020029.htm">http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2007-March/020029.htm</A>
l

and

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Simple+tree-based+interpeter">http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Simple+tree-based+interpeter</A> 

 

I've been rewriting the grammar in C for performance reasons. So far its
been fairly straightfoward - kudos to Jim Idle (and all involved).
However, the C runtime target's antlr3commontreenodestream.c doesn't
seem to implement the push() and pop() methods -or- perhaps I haven't
been looking in the right place. Could someone please direct me on how
to  &quot;Make stream jump to a new location, saving old location.&quot; as would
be needed for a simple IF statement such as this (Java version):

 

 

grammar file

---------------------

ifStat

    : 'if' '(' expr ')' ifBlock=block

                  -&gt; ^('if' ^(EXPR expr) $ifBlock)

    ;

 

AST file

--------------------

ifStat

   : ^('if' ^(EXPR v=expr) .)

   {

          CommonTree stmtNode = null;

       CommonTreeNodeStream stream = (CommonTreeNodeStream)input;

       if ($v.value != 0)

       {

                   System.out.println(&quot; 'IF' condition is true&quot;);

                         stmtNode =
(CommonTree)$ifStat.start.getChild(1);

       } else {

                      System.out.println(&quot; 'IF' condition is false&quot;);   


          }

       

       if ( stmtNode != null )

       {

                         stream.push(stream.getNodeIndex(stmtNode));

                         block();

                         stream.pop();                   

       }

    }     

 

 

Also, since the node type is always pANTRL3_BASE_TREE in the C runtime,
does this change how such a conditional would be implemented? An example
of how to do this with the C runtime would really be appreciated.

 

Thank you,

    Ron

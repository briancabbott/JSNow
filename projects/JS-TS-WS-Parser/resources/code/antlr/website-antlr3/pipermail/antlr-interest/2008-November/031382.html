<PRE>Hello Randal!

   I agree with you, but my problem is because this &quot;new language&quot; must run
on our windows mobile and java micro edition apps.

   BeanShell doesn't allow this and use a lot of APIs that are from desktop
world (reflection, for example).
   I agree with you that Java is not a good language to act as script
language. But what I'm really looking for is a way to create a small script
language that conforms to any standard (Python for example) and can be
extended easily.

   ANTLR is a good way? There is any solution out of box that i can just get
and use it to improve later without have to learn all about ANTLR?

   Get a already implemented grammar will help and save the day? If so could
you give the way to use it?

Thanks!

tk

</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR will help you detect and either eliminate or accommodate any

</I>&gt;<i> from scratch inventing a scripting language.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly, there are several dynamic languages that integrate well with
</I>&gt;<i> Java and which can serve as scripting languages for programs written in
</I>&gt;<i> Java. They include (but are by no means limited to) Groovy, Scala and
</I>&gt;<i> Clojure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In short, don't invent something you don't need and don't use a language

</I>&gt;<i> requirements and audience.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please, help!

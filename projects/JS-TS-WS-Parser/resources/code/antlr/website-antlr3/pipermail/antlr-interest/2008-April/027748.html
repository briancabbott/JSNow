<PRE>Johannes,

&gt;<i> Well, the latest changeset is 4759, but looking over the logs 
</I>&gt;<i> in perforce I see that I didn't mention it there. I assumed 
</I>&gt;<i> that once the wiki page is updated, people will know it in 
</I>&gt;<i> general. Otherwise I don't see any file in the source 
</I>&gt;<i> distribution, which mentions changes.
</I>
Thanks. The bug that required C# v2 to fix. I might have to backport that
specific fix. What was the fix for?

&gt;<i> &gt; One can use any value type with the 'CSharp' target already AFAICT. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does the new 'CSharp2' target remove the need to update the 
</I>&gt;<i> 'csharpTypeInitMap'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; default value map in the templates for unspecified value types?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, I meant this, even if it didn't came correctly over.
</I>
How is this achieved?. Using any value type without needing a template
change I mean... 

The use of Nullables to solve (the obvious solution) doesn't require a new
target AFAICT. Just C# v2+.

&gt;<i> &gt; Interesting. What problem/issue was solved by removing Token as the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; abstract base class for all the token types included with 
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR? Had 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quick look at the diffs and nothing jumped out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The simple reason is that Token as base class didn't add 
</I>&gt;<i> anything beyond an extra step in the hierarchy. Nearly all 
</I>&gt;<i> IToken properties were abstract and the one that wasn't was 
</I>&gt;<i> overridden anyway. Also the Java target operates on the 
</I>&gt;<i> interface itself, as does the rest of C#. Nothing but extra 
</I>&gt;<i> complexity for no benefits.
</I>
YAGNI?. We can agree to differ about Token's utility. It's easy enough to
retain it locally here in any case.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - No binaries for .Net 1.1 created yet. It is on my todo list.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you have .NET v1.1 and .NET v2 installed on your box (or 
</I>&gt;<i> in a VM), 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the Nant script takes care of building both:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    nant release -t:net-1.1 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    nant release -t:net-2.0
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, it could be that I'm using Linux and Nant 0.86 Beta, but I get:
</I>
Most likely is. We didn't have time to do Mono build testing for obvious
reasons...

&gt;<i> I suppose it doesn't matter because I will switch to Prebuild 
</I>&gt;<i> due to later reorgs in the code base. Then I can get easily 
</I>&gt;<i> uptodate project files.
</I>
Prebuild has bugs in it's Nant build file generation and vs2005/vs2008
project file generation iirc. Related to resource files I think but can't
remember the specifics at the moment, sorry.

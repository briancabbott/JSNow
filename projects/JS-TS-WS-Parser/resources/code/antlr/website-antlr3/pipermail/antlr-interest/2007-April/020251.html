Those are good things to know about, of course. If you have no need to 
know the precise locus of the origination of an exception, and very 
often that is the case (debugging being the only real exception, I 
imagine), then a pre-built instance is just fine. You can still set 
descriptive attributes in the Exception (subclass) instance, with the 
caveat that they must be retrieved before the same instance is again 
thrown. It seems that in practice this is an easily accommodated 
requirement.

I'm not so sure about that. Backward compatibility was the original goal 
and a significant constraint on the design of the Java 5 generic 
mechanism, but as I recall, there turned out to be some issues and 
that's why there's a distinct class file version identifier for classes 
compiled for language version 5 and those classes will not load in a 
1.4-series JVM.

I'd test these things out before committing to any scheme that uses 
generics and purports to produce 1.4-compatible class files.

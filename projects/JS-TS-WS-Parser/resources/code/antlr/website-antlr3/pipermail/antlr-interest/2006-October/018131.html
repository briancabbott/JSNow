Right, I'm building a simple tool to do that right now.
But what I'm doing will probably be specific to Java/C/C++ expressions only.

So my main recommendation to Terence is to think about how one could 
build a tool
that does this for any grammar and in a very flexible way (with more 
than just
'v' and 'x' types of placeholders, hooks into code (i.e. &quot;actions&quot;), 
constraints
(&quot;only apply this rule at certain points in the AST), etc.

Basically, an alternative to the treewalker approach, for those of us 
who want to
frame the problem as a series of these kinds of rules, as opposed to a 
series of
actions that fire at various points during a tree walk.

</I>
Yes, but I think in general that &quot;faster&quot; at runtime is not a big issue for
high-level-language to high-level-language translators (as opposed to
compilers).

</I>
There is syntax and there is semantics. Syntax means only correct use of 
the grammar, but not necessarily that the semantics are correct, that 
there is meaning being conferred. &quot;The jam flew like carwinkle.&quot; is 
correct syntax, but still nonsense.

Other example. In C# you can use modifiers in front of class-, method-, 
etc.-definitions. But while there is a set of known modifiers, only a 
subset is valid for certain definitions and even there is additional 
context involved. Allowing all modifiers at every place would be 
syntactically correct.

Semantically correct, you can use &quot;virtual&quot; on methods, but not on 
classes. Classes can be &quot;protected&quot; or &quot;private&quot; only when being nested 
themselves. Methods can have &quot;override&quot; only, if there is in a base 
class a suitable &quot;virtual&quot; method.

Some of these limitations can be expressed in BNF where you just allow 
only sensible modifiers, removing only the ones which are never used. 
But this imposes semantic meaning on a pure syntactical construct. This 
should be done in a second pass, because then one can check for other 
context-dependent limitations.

&gt;<i> what would the second pass look like? what grammar should it use? a tree 
</I>&gt;<i> grammar maybe?
</I>
A tree grammar is probably the right approach. At least I don't know any 
reason why it isn't. I would use the first pass also to create a symbol 
table. While I haven't gotten around to get my own C# compiler to 
include symbol tables yet, my dissertation thesis may be still useful 
for you, at least the bits about compiler design and ANTLR grammar 
tweaking. If you like I can send you one copy.

&gt;<i> i want to do a mostly complete transformation using a heterogenous ast 
</I>&gt;<i> build by using rule arguments and return values. this puts more stuff to 
</I>&gt;<i> the rules than using rewrite rules but the result is really nice.
</I>
That goes beyond my own expertise. Sorry. :(

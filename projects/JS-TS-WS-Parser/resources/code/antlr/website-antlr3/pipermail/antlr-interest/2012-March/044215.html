<PRE>Hi, I found a C++ grammar at download section of

<A HREF="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/hcb/">http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/hcb/</A>

its in xml form, but I guess it should be easy to write a grammar to
parse this xml to antlr grammar notation (I have not done so yet)...

I would like to avoid a target language as far as possible (I
personally find it hard to interpret/use a &quot;polished&quot; grammar full of
actions and detail handling) and would like to pass it to a tree
grammar before any actions are applied (is this possible?). I inted to
use java as target language as soon as actions are unavoidable (there
already is an antlr grammar with c++ target)...

Theres already some issues I dont understand in the xml: theres
multiple sections (do they refer to certain parsing passes? or are
they just grouped by topic?), and the literal &quot;while&quot; seems to be
present in both the keyword and iteration rules...

Another problem I have is: how should things like #include be handled?
to call the translation unit rule these files should already be
included, so it seems unavoidable to have actions that include these
files like a preprocessor would? pretty confusing all

Anyone else interested in collaborating? i.e. creating a grammar to
convert this xml to grammar notation, and then finding out what the
sections mean?
I think once the sections have their own antlr grammar notations, we
could more easily see which sections depend on others, etc....

regards!
</PRE>

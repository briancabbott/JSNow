</I>&gt;<i> Missing ']'&quot;.  However, for named tokens (e.g. those created in the tokens  
</I>&gt;<i> { ... } stanza), tokenNames contains er.. the name of the token.  So for  
</I>&gt;<i> example, I'm using the names RPAREN for the token ')', and I see messages  
</I>&gt;<i> like &quot;... Missing RPAREN.&quot;  Unfortunately these names aren't going to make  
</I>&gt;<i> any sense for users.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>It is the same as the other targets, in that you need to create a local 
function that returns/displays/adds to the message, the name you want to 
use for error display. It is just a switch statement on the token type 
basically, or you could create a local map and initialize it the first 
time it is required. It is just a bit of slog really. Java provides a 
method to override to do this, but in C, you just call your own local 
function.
&gt;<i> I understand why tokenNames is the way it is (named tokens could be more  
</I>&gt;<i> compilcated than a simple string).  However, is there a way that I can  
</I>&gt;<i> show the matching string for simple tokens rather than the name, (possibly  
</I>&gt;<i> limited to just those declared with &quot;tokens {...}&quot;)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I considered removing some or all of the simple named tokens, but this  
</I>&gt;<i> would be inconvenient as my grammar generates trees which re-use the same  
</I>&gt;<i> tokens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm already maintaining my own version of C.stg for other reasons, so I  
</I>&gt;<i> could make changes to that if necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Let me know if there is something that you changed that really needs to 
be in the main template - I know of at least two things that I need to 
resolve (@after for instance), but obviously would prefer that you can 
use the main branch. I don't know when you split, but there have been 
one or two tweaks to C.stg, so make sure you pick them up.

</I>The token stream must know what input has been consumed and what is 
pending. I can't see why it could not re-lex the pending input but I 
have to admit I don't understand the antlr internals: so I'll take your 
word for it.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>My parsing problem is that sometimes fields in my text file are 
delimited by '.', ':', ';', and various other tokens. My problem is that 
in many cases these characters are part of the values of the fields and 
in other cases they are delimiters. I can only know which is which at 
parse time. So I thought what I was doing was the natural solution. 
Obviously I just misinterpreted the documentation!

Does anyone have any advice for how to approach this problem? None of 
the examples in the antlr documentation deal with this sort of grammar.

Thanks,
John.

Please take some time to read through the online documentation again - 
specifically the instructions on building the source code. Perhaps that 
is what you are trying to follow, but if there is no configure script 
then you have downloaded the wrong version from somewhere. I don't think 
that putting source and binary versions of ANTLR on distributions is 
very useful, it seems to throw people off.

Reading those instructions all the way thorough once will be of enormous 
benefit.

The versions on the download page (linked from main download page on the 
home page) are the ones you want:

I just checked these distributions and the configure script is where it 
should be. Otherwise you need to have the autoconf authoring tools 
loaded and run autoreconf -ir - but that is only for maintainers. 
Configure works out that you don't have install and uses a pre-supplied 
script. By the way, you should probably install those kinds of tools 
anyway. I thought that Ubuntu had some &quot;Development&quot; package that loaded 
all that stuff, however I had to give up on Ubuntu as it was too 
unstable and out of date.

The instructions you should be reading if you are not doing so already 
are linked from the ANTLR home page as Runtime API Doc. Select the C 
link and read ANTLR3 C Runtime API and Usage Guide.

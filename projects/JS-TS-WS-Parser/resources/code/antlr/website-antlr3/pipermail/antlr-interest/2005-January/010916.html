Yup.

ANTLR2 does not generate the speediest parsers/scanners. It's easy
though to use a flex scanner with antlr2. ANTLR provides some extra's
over flex/bison in terms of ease and error handling. Also antlr
parsers are very debuggable due to the fact that they're readable.
ANTLR2 performance relies for a lot on how you structure your grammar
(use of syntactic predicates, that introduce backtracking).

In general flex/bison will be faster than antlr2. ANTLR3 is in
prototype stage and will be a lot faster, the hope is to release
ANTLR3 within a year. ANTLR3 might be faster than flex/bison. ANTLR3
will also give much more ease in developing grammars (thanks to the
new LL(*) algorithm and intended tool support).

&gt;<i> I am trying to do contract management--processing
</I>&gt;<i> contract terms over millions of financial transaction
</I>&gt;<i> records..
</I>
It is possible to get good performance with ANTLR2 but it might
require some tinkering with the support lib. And it also depends on
what you want/need in the backend.

Cheers,

Ric

<PRE>I ought to do some tests, but my own query language parser was first
done in java and took forever to load and get going (fault of java not
the code really), though I could have course have pre-loaded it and so
on. Once it was going it was pretty OK. The C version however is many
many times quicker. So, my on experience says that it is very much
better, but I can't give you anything specific until I do some real
tests. I have also been running profiling on the out and will be making
general tweaks to improve performance over time.

Hi Jim

 

Do you know if there are general performance comparison information

between the C parsers and java parsers all generated by antlr ?

 

 

Merry Christmas

 

Tom

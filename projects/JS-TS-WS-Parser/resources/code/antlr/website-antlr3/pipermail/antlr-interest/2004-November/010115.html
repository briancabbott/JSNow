Oh Michael, I can.

Because last 10 years my main job is creation of super-fast piece of code.
I have made a lots of different profiles for a lots of algorithms,
with different compilers and different platforms.

So I hope I have enough experience to say &quot;by eye measure&quot;
that here or there things can be done better.

&gt;<i> More importantly, how can you convince other people to accept your
</I>&gt;<i> speculation?.
</I>
Alex Sedow already have give you exact numbers:
    3-4 times speed up thanks to special string + allocator.

Do not worry. We will make profiling also and will try fix some things self.
Of course we will inform this list about results.


&gt;&gt;<i> * may be another problem is in exceptions, although I like mechanizm of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exceptions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think that for 3.0 Rick and community should produce own, special, very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> optimized for ANTLR tasks antl::string class. This class should simply have 2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pointers on start/end of tokem. Pointer must point directly into original
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parsed text. There is no need copy any byte of parsed text. Everything must
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work on pointers. Tell me that I am wrong?! :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can't but, I can at least ask that you take of one the simple

</I>
Problem is that I do not have a lots of wish to study internals of ANTLR and
its algorithms. This is separate big task...

Exists major developers of ANTLR. I give an advice.
It is business of these developers listen or not.
It is business of these developers TRY and PROVE that std::string is best of
the best by speed.

But if they will find that special class can give us AT LEAST 10% of speed
up, then I vote for new class. I hope my logic is clear ?   :-)


Just I want underline. Many times was told:
    parsing is so fast task comparing to MAJOR DBMS tasks.

    Now we have the first benches which show that our DBMS
    can do work 10-15 times faster that parser itself.

    This means that _such_ parser become huge overhead for us.
    this is not pleasant of course.

I like ANTLR. We have spend 18 months with it.
So I'd prefer get faster ANLTR that to be forced for new parser.

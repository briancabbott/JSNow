<PRE>The problem I find is actually FINDING all this stuff. I have a bit of
an aversion to hypertext, much prefer a linear hard copy in front of me,
and find RMS's addiction to &quot;info&quot; for GNU documentation highly
offensive ...

Anyway, enough of the rant ... and I know - the rule is &quot;if you want it,
why don't you write it&quot;, but a FAQ, clearly signposted, that consists of
a mildly complicated, highly documented, teaching grammar would be well
received. There are some wonderful resources out there, but IME it's
been a case of either pointers to &quot;get you started&quot; stuff, or a case of
&quot;look at the supplied grammars&quot; (but which one do I want to study for a
&quot;teach yourself&quot; course?).

I'm not saying there isn't anything out there, but I am frustrated time
and time again in that I seem to find either elementary stuff aimed at
newbies, or reference stuff aimed at experts. It's almost impossible to
find stuff aimed at the &quot;I know you're experienced but have never met
this before&quot; level guy. When I started programming in C I went on a
&quot;Beginning C for experienced programmers&quot; course - the prerequisite
being you had to know one - any - computer language well but were
presumed to know nothing about C at all. Where do you find stuff like
that?

Cheers,
Wol

Yeah, it seems people need a guide to reading the code sometimes.  This
stuff is in Ter's lectures, but maybe something that pointed out
techniques
used in the examples would be helpful too for those of you who just
start
hacking away?

Great Monty, thanks - these little tips of yours are really helpful to
those
of us running blind here : ). I will structure things that way then...

Cheers,
Robin

&gt;<i> Yeah, typically you wouldn't nest at each DOT, you would have one root
</I>and
&gt;<i> then all the DOT WHATEVERs as children.  The java grammar or C grammar
</I>&gt;<i> should have examples of this.

</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, I got it to work like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> primary_expression!
</I>&gt;<i> { AST curAst = null;}
</I>&gt;<i>  :    ps:primary_start
</I>&gt;<i>       {curAst = ps_AST;}
</I>&gt;<i>      (
</I>&gt;<i>          ma:member_access
</I>&gt;<i>             {     curAst.setFirstChild(ma_AST);
</I>&gt;<i>                    curAst=ma_AST;
</I>&gt;<i>             }
</I>&gt;<i>      )*
</I>&gt;<i>     {#primary_expression = #ps;}
</I>&gt;<i>  ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe there is an easier way? Maybe I 'dont want' this in the first
</I>&gt;<i> place...?

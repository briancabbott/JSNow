<PRE>Cliff,

I'm not asking how to make abstractions or functions, or &quot;how to look
at other languages and figure it out myself.&quot; No matter the
abstraction mechanisms you have in place (and we have a bunch of them
in our language), for you to complete certain kinds of operations you
need some kind of a low level bridge that can ultimately tell new, or
unique, pieces of hardware to physically do something. For example, if
a user wanted to add in a MIDI controller in our language, or a sound
library, or to tap into an ethernet controller, or some unique piece
of hardware we haven't considered, that simply would not exist unless
we had a low level bridge, which they could then tie into both the
hardware and our language, and then ultimately build abstractions
around in our language (e.g., a wrapper to a JNI library, as I stated
before).

There's lots of ways to approach it. LUA has an interesting approach.
Java uses JNI, while C allows you to embed assembly directly if
desired. I'm curious what more modern approaches folks take.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Our development team here is nearly complete with a DSL that we've

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or so. Right now, we parse down to the ANTLR Java target and are

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> statements, looping), there are no APIs or libraries for doing file
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IO, connecting to hardware, network programming, or other such things.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Does this community have any experience adding in these sorts of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> features, as in, suggestions as for what kind of approach we should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> take? For example, we could allow something like a Java Native
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Interface, that would allow a developer to connect in utilities that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allow things like File access. Or, we could allow custom native
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functions for low level things, like a file keyword, but that doesn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sound very flexible or extensible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any general suggestions on an appropriate approach to take?

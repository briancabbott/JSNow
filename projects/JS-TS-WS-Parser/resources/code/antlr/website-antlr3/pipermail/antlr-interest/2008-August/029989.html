<PRE>Hi Ian,

My sentiments exactly re v2 conversion to v3.  That is why v3 is STILL  
written in v2 ;)

Performance is not bad with backtracking and memoization; linear time  
cost.  Still better to let ANTLR predict with a simple DFA rather than  
backtracking.  Also can set backtracking per rule.

Thanks for the kudos, Ian!  Glad to see you using v3, even if painful  
to get there.

</I>&gt;<i> I admit that I have not RTFM (e.g., the last chapters of The Book

</I>&gt;<i> match the longest sequence first, so that a match is not missed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    In summary, I send my thanks to Terance and Co. for the great

</I>&gt;<i> I've ever had before with a parser generator.

</I>
That seems like a neat idea.  It might be useful to be able
to have a validating predicate before consuming a token, as this might
be at the correct line number and column position to report a compiler
error.  I guess then if the action was empty, like:

a : {p1}? {} {p2}? A
  | A
  ;

Then {p2}? would still be a validating semantic predicate.
 
&gt;<i> If it's really desired to have it be a disambiguating predicate, 
</I>&gt;<i> then as others have pointed out it should be possible for the 
</I>&gt;<i> grammar author to merge the action into p2, and even then possibly 
</I>&gt;<i> merge p2 with p1.  So making this change results in a gain of 
</I>&gt;<i> functionality without losing any -- another good reason to do it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Having said all this, I'm not sure my opinion should be given much

</I>
Which is fine if you are lucky enough to be parsing a context free
language that does not need dis-ambiguating semantic predicates.

&gt;<i> -- if given the option to specify arbitrary code, most 
</I>&gt;<i> people want to use parameters and prior-matched fragments to make 
</I>&gt;<i> decisions with, and when they get hoisted then all bets are off.
</I>
Of course I do not wish to use parameters, as you are saying that
does not work as the dis-ambiguating semantic predicates may be hoisted.

&gt;<i> For example, what about this case:
</I>&gt;<i>    rule: A {bar();} b=B ({foo($b)}? C D)? E;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The sempred here is a disambiguating predicate, but it might need 
</I>&gt;<i> to be hoisted in certain contexts -- and if that happens, things 
</I>&gt;<i> will break, since it turns out that foo() depends on something 
</I>&gt;<i> done by bar().
</I>
The results of the something that was done by bar() could be either:

- stored in the symbol table.

- stored in the token A, and then foo() could scan backwards
looking for A, and retrieve the result.

Likewise for foo() needing to look at B:

- An action could be introduced after consuming token B to store
information about B in the symbol table, then foo() could look
up the information about B in the symbol table.

- foo() could scan backwards looking for B.

- An action could be introduced after consuming token B to store
information about B in the symbol table, and a pointer to the
symbol table information could be stored in token B.  Then foo()
foo() could scan backwards looking for B.

Thanks, Mark
 
&gt;<i> Admittedly this is a bit of a contrived example, but I'm not sure 
</I>&gt;<i> there is a good solution for this last one (the only idea which 
</I>&gt;<i> comes to mind involves backtracking and &quot;rollback&quot; clauses, which 
</I>&gt;<i> seems bad for performance).  But it is something that people will 
</I>&gt;<i> beat their head against from time to time.

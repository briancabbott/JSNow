 this displays the decision-making DFA, not the syntax diagrams.

I believe you can detach some of the windows, but maybe not the syntax diagram view.

 I will probably leave this out of the 1st version.

&gt;<i> A few other thoughts after reading your post:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. I definitely agree that the syntax diagram, interpreter, console,
</I>&gt;<i> and debugger are sort of odd as tabs. Having them all as pinned
</I>&gt;<i> windows is more common in an IDE
</I>
 can you tell me what they pinned window is exactly?

&gt;<i> and has the advantage of letting you
</I>&gt;<i> see more than one at a time (if you wish).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. It might be nice if you could have (on mac) a tabbed interface for
</I>&gt;<i> multiple grammars instead of multiple floating windows.
</I>
 I think for imported grammars that might work.

&gt;<i> My most common
</I>&gt;<i> use case is switching back and forth between a tree walker and a
</I>&gt;<i> parser.
</I>
 true, but isn't a nicer to see two Windows next to each other to compare?

&gt;<i> Managing multiple tabs on multiple windows is somewhat more
</I>&gt;<i> tedious than having one window where you can click on a new file and
</I>&gt;<i> the syntax/interpreter, etc windows auto-respond accordingly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's a few more thoughts, for what it's worth,
</I>
 thanks very much for the feedback!

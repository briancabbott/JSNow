<PRE>
I'm making some progress on my own problem (quoted below).  I've created an antlr3config.h file by hand, as I found some docs suggesting that I should do so.  I'm now trying to build a project containing the antlr C sources, my generated parser from AntlrWorks, and the main.c example on this documentation page:

	<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/api/C/buildrec.html">http://www.antlr.org/api/C/buildrec.html</A>

Actually, I have not taken that file exactly as it is on that page; I needed to make two changes:
1. In place of #include &lt;treeparser.h&gt;, I have followed the advice in the code's comments and instead included the generated files for my language, LMParser.h and LMLexer.h.
2. Throughout that file, it uses Lang as the language name, which I have replaced everywhere with LM, the name of my language as in the code generated from AntlrWorks.

However, my build still fails, and the errors indicate that there are some identifiers that are not declared.  So I grepped for them, but they appear nowhere in the antlr sources at all, only in that one example piece of documentation!  So is that documentation out-of-date?  Is there a correct piece of documentation I should be following?

Thanks!

Nathan

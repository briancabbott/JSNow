Sort of a, &quot;Tell me you need a TV in your golf cart&quot; kind of question?
:<i>-)
</I>
I'm hard pressed to provide a more defendable answer than &quot;because that
is the way I think&quot;.  It's sort of like the object models between
Smalltalk, Java, C++ etc.  Some people are comfortable with the
&quot;everything is a subclass of Object&quot; way of doing things while others
say &quot;why do you needlessly abstract things into a common base class&quot;.

When I think about the various structures in the language I'm parsing, I
think of them as distinctly different entities (declarations, type
definitions, expressions) and not as just a bunch of homogenous nodes.
That is just the way I think about it.  I feel much more comfortable
working with an object knowing what it is and what I can expect from it
without having to do a bunch of run-time type interrogation and casting.

Think about it this way.  Imagine trying to program in Java or C++ and
not ever using the &quot;.&quot; (as in computer.drives[1].head.position) and
instead having to interrogate every object using only &quot;getFirstChild()&quot;
and &quot;getNextSibling()&quot; and having only type and text information.
Imagine trying to express what I just typed? (i.e.
computer.drives[1].head.position) You get something like:

Object getHeadPosition(Object computer, int drive_number) {
  int found = 0;

  // Search for all drives associated with computer
  for(Object d=computer.getFirstChild();d!=null;d=d.getNextSibling()) {
    // Is this a drive (or some other member of computer)?
    if (d.type==Drive) {
	found++;
      if (found==drive_number) {
        for(Object h=d.getFirstChild();h!=null;h=h.getNextSibling()) {
          if (h.type==Head) {
            for(Object p=h.getFirstChild();p!=null;p=p.getNextSibling())
{
              if (p.type==Position) {
                return p;
              }
            }
            throw NoPosition;
          }
          return d;
        }
        throw NoHead;
      }
    }
  }
  throw CantFindDrive;
}

Yikes!  Isn't &quot;computer.drives[1].position.head&quot; much simpler and
statically checkable?

Granted, tree parsers make this a lot easier, but I'm not using tree
parsers (and perhaps I'm just dense, but I don't think they will help me
in what I'm trying to do).

&gt;<i> The main reason I've seen is for people who want
</I>&gt;<i> to access the node objects directly from C++ instead of through a tree
</I>&gt;<i> grammar.  I've only recently tried to use them with C++ on a contract
</I>&gt;<i> and I agree that antlr's tree building scheme is not easy to
</I>&gt;<i> comprehend.
</I>
Let's forget about C++.  I'm doing this in Java (although many of my
previous comments *were* directed at the C++ side).  I switched to Java
in the hopes that things would be a lot easier but it didn't turn out
that way.

&gt;<i> The more diverse uses we collect the better off we are in the future.
</I>&gt;<i> You're the one who wrote up a whole bunch of notes on tree building
</I>&gt;<i> already, right?
</I>
Yes, I did write up a bunch of stuff before.  I'm not sure how useful it
was but I will try to write up some additional material once I get
something I'm happy with (on the off chance that other people are
interested in an alternative approach).

&gt;<i> It really helps.
</I>&gt;<i>

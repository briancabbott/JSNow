</I>&gt;<i> It depends where you are asking from. Also, if your input is really

</I>&gt;<i> and UCS2 and don't handle surrogates. If you want UTF32  (this is what
</I>&gt;<i> is handled internally) or OTF16 then you need to roll your own. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>Well technically our input is UTF-16, but we won't be supporting
languages outside the BMP, so UCS2 would do just fine.

&gt;<i> &gt; When I parse my input, the token offsets are all rubbish. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You realize that the indexes are in characters and not bytes right?
</I>
Yes I do, but even in characters the indexes I get returned are way too
big. As stated for the simple input &quot;12376 87562356&quot;, the idexes are in
the millions.

&gt;<i>  What does your driver program look like. 
</I>
I just followed the basic example in the docs (and sprinkled some C++
sauce over it) :

Antlr::Pointer&lt;
    ANTLR3_INPUT_STREAM_struct
  &gt;                                   input(
                                       antlr3NewUCS2StringInPlaceStream(
                                          text.begin(),
                                          text.size(),
                                          0
                                        )
                                      );    
  
  Antlr::Pointer&lt;
    WarpLexer
  &gt;                                   lexer(
                                        WarpLexerNew( input.get() )
                                      );   

  Antlr::Pointer&lt;
    ANTLR3_COMMON_TOKEN_STREAM_struct
  &gt;                                   tokens(
                                       antlr3CommonTokenStreamSourceNew(
                                          ANTLR3_SIZE_HINT,
                                          TOKENSOURCE( lexer.get() )
                                        )
                                      );

  Antlr::Pointer&lt;
    WarpParser
  &gt;                                   parser
                                        = WarpParserNew( tokens.get() );

  WarpParser_translation_unit_return  parser_return
                                        =
parser-&gt;translation_unit( parser.get() );

[...]
&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Naturally I was working with 3.1b2 and not the official release, so when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I saw that 3.1 was released I went ahead and tried that one. This was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even worse! 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are you sure you don't need a few more exclamation marks to get across
</I>&gt;<i> your disdain with more emphasis?
</I>
My apologies if this was the tone you picked up in my posting. There is
no disdain whatsoever on my part. As said, I'm very impressed with ANTLR
and I like it a lot.

&gt;<i> &gt; 3.1 with the C target does not even generate the type of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; AST in the return structs of the rules. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that you meant to say: &quot;I looked in the past posts of the last
</I>&gt;<i> two weeks and saw that this question was answered 6 times already and
</I>&gt;<i> that when producing trees you need:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> options
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>    ASTLabelType=pANTLR3_BASE_TREE;
</I>&gt;<i> } 
</I>
Yes, Gavin Lambert pointed this out to me yesterday on this very list.

&gt;<i> &gt; Clearly we are missing something important here. Or maybe I am missing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something obvious. I used the C-runtime from the ANTLR source
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distribution and tried it also with the stand-alone C lib distro. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; building an Ubuntu 7.1 with gcc 3.4 (64-bit).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Try the released runtime, correcting your grammar and make sure that
</I>&gt;<i> you are using the UCS2 input stream. Use the built in references for
</I>&gt;<i> $pos and so on in the lexer and see what you get.
</I>
Well, I would use the released runtime, if the generated grammar would
compile (see my reply to Gavin Lambert's post yesterday). I have no clue
what's going on there either.

By the way, what's $pos? I found no mention to it in the book.
&gt;<i> 
</I>Thanks,

Sven

An interesting point, though, I'm not all that worried about this issue.

&gt;<i> For example, when Artistic State released &quot;Perl for Windows&quot;, everybody

</I>
Interesting...problem is that the current version of ANTLR could be 
&quot;stolen&quot;.  The horse may already be out of the barn ;)

Thanks,
Ter

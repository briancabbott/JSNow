&gt;<i> &gt; like a nightmare. So after several months work, I gave up on

</I>&gt;<i> Really interesting approach. I have two problems similar with those

</I>&gt;<i> and the comments reassignment. I used a system similar with the code
</I>&gt;<i> snippets you mention. I use XML because I need to describe classes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder though, is the Token stream approach powerful enough?
</I>&gt;<i> For example if you have the code snippet:
</I>&gt;<i> someMethod(x) -&gt; translation
</I>&gt;<i> and there are two overloaded version of someMethod say:
</I>&gt;<i> someMethod(char c) and someMethod(uint c)
</I>&gt;<i> how can you provide a different translation for those cases?
</I>
I would just write two rules, one that matches:
v1(char v2) {
...and the other that matches:
v1(uint v2) {

The first would match any method that takes a single &quot;char&quot; arg
The &quot;v1&quot; and &quot;v2&quot; are placeholders. And this pattern:
v1(x) {
...would match any method declaration at all.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My approach uses AST to AST translation.
</I>&gt;<i> Why did you refuse this approach? What was the main drawback
</I>&gt;<i> of this approach?
</I>
I just found AST to AST too cumbersome.
To oversimplify, I'd rather just write:
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) --&gt; public static void main(String[]
args)

Writing that line is far easier than figuring out what each of
those two ASTs look like and how to convert from one to the
other.

I also found that examples like the &quot;main&quot; one above
seemed to be about the
most complicated examples shown for AST translation languages
like TXL. When in fact, that &quot;main&quot; example is one of the
simplest rules, and I have many hundreds of rules, most more
complicated than that.

I found that I was just getting bogged down trying to keep ASTs
in my head. I felt it was much easier to write translation rules
in simple text as shown with the &quot;--&gt;&quot; separator above. That way,
you never even have to think about ASTs much.

Do you have any documentation on your AST-to-AST mechanism?

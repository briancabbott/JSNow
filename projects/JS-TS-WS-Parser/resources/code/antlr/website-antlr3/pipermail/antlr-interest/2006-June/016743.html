Hi Thomas, that error is a code gen issue using my new table-based  
approach.  Can you send me the grammar directly?


&gt;<i> I have managed to somewhat chart the issues but largely through  
</I>&gt;<i> trial and error, removing rules I suspect might cause troubles and  
</I>&gt;<i> rewriting the grammar a number of times in different ways and  
</I>&gt;<i> seeing where it falls apart. Are there any better methods?
</I>
Well, the analysis usually only fails when you have rules like:

a : foo ...
   | foo ...
   ;

where foo is huge or recursive.  It then backs off to LL(1) by  
dfault...i'm adding a backtrack option that will backtrack for any  
alt in the decision that is a problem.

&gt;<i> I understand you can set a fixed k and resolve the issue that way  
</I>&gt;<i> but this seems like a non-optimal solution as I think some of the  
</I>&gt;<i> ambiguities should be resolvable without backtracking (especially  
</I>&gt;<i> the main statement rule which currently requires fixed lookahead +  
</I>&gt;<i> a predicate to distinguish varDef and funcDef rules).
</I>
Generally they are...my java statement rule is super complicated.

&gt;<i> Also, what effect does setting a fixed lookahead on one rule have  
</I>&gt;<i> on the analysis of calling rules?
</I>
It only affects the set of tokens used to predict which alt gets  
applied not the calling of rules.

&gt;<i> And, specifically, has anyone looked at doing a C grammar in Antlr 3?
</I>
If you send it to me, we should have it built within a few hours!

&gt;<i> Oh yeah, and wow, Antlr 3 rocks.
</I>
Thanks!  I suspect now that people are really using it we'll find a  
few nasty surprises that I'll raceto fix by 3.0 final.  I'll look  
into your error today though.

</I>I have developed a source to source translator too. It translates ASP pages 
(text + JavaScript + VbScript) into PHP.
Because 2 languages are involved the steps I use are more and of greater 
complexity. However, I do not have multiple passes.
Here are my steps
1)lex your input into tokens. A StreamSelector is used to join multiple 
languages used in the same ASP page. The vb lexer will do some name 
transformation so case sensitiveness of identifiers can be guarantied.
2)recognize the tokens in your grammar and build a source AST. Also find for 
each identifier it's type(if it's possible) and recognize functions and classes
declared in the page.
3)recognize and morph your source AST to a target AST. Informations collected 
from parsing are used here (functions, classes, identifiers...).
4)generate your output from the target AST. I use an other tree parser for this 
who does not produce AST.

This was my approach.

<PRE>Thank you for your responses. I am biased against using semantics predicates
for the reason that I want to keep out the target language as much as
possible from the parser that generates the AST.

Are there any other approaches other than Jims?

The downside I see to this approach is that one always needs to keep a
global list of keywords under the 'id' production. This becomes a bit of a
nightmare for maintenance.

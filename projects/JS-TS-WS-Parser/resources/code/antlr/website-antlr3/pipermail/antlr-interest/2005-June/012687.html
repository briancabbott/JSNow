Good catch!!!  yeah :)

</I>
Yeah, sorry about that...i'm scrambling to finish up the damn thing.   
The examples do help, right?
&gt;<i>  My only fear (hoping not to start a religious war) is that  
</I>&gt;<i> graphical tools built in Java always seem to crash, hang, have slow  
</I>&gt;<i> GUIs and so on (at least on windows, and though it would be easy to

</I>&gt;<i> tool suffers form the same issues &#8211; though I am loathe to offer any  
</I>&gt;<i> judgment at this stage in the game &#8211; I would prefer to contribute  
</I>&gt;<i> to its betterment.
</I>
Java guis are indeed slow, but portable...sort of. ;)  As for  
crashing and hanging, I find this tool not too bad for early access  
release :)
&gt;<i>  I very much like the syntax diagrams, though I have not decided if  
</I>&gt;<i> they are just a cool gimmick for the programmer or not yet.
</I>They are like the &quot;dashboard&quot; on Mac OS X Tiger...cool, but not  
always useful to experienced developers.  OTOH, they are REALLY great  
for tracking down ambiguities...for this, they are really spectacular :)
&gt;<i> They certainly will aid in documentation enormously. Perhaps we  
</I>&gt;<i> could have a mode that could export all the syntax diagrams at once  
</I>&gt;<i> (sorry if it is there and I missed it)?
</I>
Use -nfa or -dfa to get something like that from antlr itself.  I  
think Jean will have something to print / generate PDF for these  
puppies out later.
&gt;<i>  Some suggestions (not criticisms):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I would suggest that errors from parsing the grammar appear by  
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;check grammar&#8221;, or &#8220;Build&#8221;, in their own pane, instead of the Java  
</I>&gt;<i> console, and be able to double click them to locate the error in  
</I>&gt;<i> the source code.
</I>&gt;<i> Don&#8217;t prompt for output locations all the time, but allow a change  
</I>&gt;<i> of &#8216;properties&#8217; if the programmer wants to change the output  
</I>&gt;<i> location after the first run.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In light of the above, perhaps have a project file that hold such  
</I>&gt;<i> things. Borrowing from some of the good things in like Visual  
</I>&gt;<i> Studio .Net 2003 (err, I mean the freeware tools such as Eclipse),  
</I>&gt;<i> is not a bad idea. I realize of course that there was quite an  
</I>&gt;<i> effort to get to this point first and such things tend to get  
</I>&gt;<i> filled in afterwards.
</I>
Thanks a lot for the feedback!  Good stuff.

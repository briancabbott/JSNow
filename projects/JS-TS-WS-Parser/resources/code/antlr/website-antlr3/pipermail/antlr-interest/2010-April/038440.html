<PRE>Hi Ron,
Thanks for the reply. It helped me get few of my doubts cleared as to what I
have to do. It turns out, that the errors that I am trying to catch are the
lexer errors, and not the parser errors. I will look into that, and once I
have the solution I would post back here. If anyone has already dealt with
this issue, any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks

</I>&gt;<i> There's a getNumberOfSyntaxErrors() method available on the parser object.
</I>&gt;<i> If there were any errors this will return a number greater than zero (though
</I>&gt;<i> I don't believe it includes lexer errors, you have to check separately for
</I>&gt;<i> them). You can test this when the parsing finishes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To detect at the end of individual rules, you can test the state.failed
</I>&gt;<i> field. But just looking at the generated code, I don't think testing it in
</I>&gt;<i> the @after will work, because a match failure will result in an early
</I>&gt;<i> return, so the @after won't get executed. I don't know if there's a way to
</I>&gt;<i> tell Antlr to put your code in the finally block to guarantee it always gets
</I>&gt;<i> executed (and if so, you'd probably want to check state.backtracking to see
</I>&gt;<i> if this is a real failure or a failure during backtracking). Otherwise, I
</I>&gt;<i> think you'd need to check in an action in the calling rule (but then that
</I>&gt;<i> action won't be executed until the calling rule succeeds). I'm not sure if
</I>&gt;<i> there's a way to make this work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Turning off recovery is a separate issue. I don't know if there's any other
</I>&gt;<i> way than overriding the recover method and possibly some related methods in
</I>&gt;<i> BaseRecognizer.

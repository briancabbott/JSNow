<PRE>Thanks Paul and Ric, I appreciate your help. I didn't know of the 
-diagnostic option. It helps greatly as it lists down the FIRST and FOLLOW 
sets, which I used to generate by manually for debugging.

Although it is still not clear that even after a lookahead of 2, the above 
warnings are generated because I thought that the after looking ahead two 
tokens the parser would be able to decide concretely as to which rule to 
follow. I guess the diagnostic files may help...

Thanks again.
Tarun

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Notice that the (DOT IDENT)* may match the empty word e.g. nothing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Add to that that (DOT TAB)? may also match nothing. Add to that that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the start of both may be a DOT. So antlr has a hard time choosing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; between the closure (DOT IDENT)* and the optional part (DOT TAB)?.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But what if k is 2, as Tarun said in his original post?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure didn't follow the first part of the thread, didn't see the
</I>&gt;<i> complete grammar. It may come from surrounding rules, maybe in
</I>&gt;<i> combination with the alternative that only matches a TAB. Would have
</I>&gt;<i> to check all the lookahead sets generated with -diagnostic. When you
</I>&gt;<i> have parts that match nothing or complete rules that match nothing you
</I>&gt;<i> get really unintuitive behaviour in the lookahead sets, that's why we
</I>&gt;<i> have ANTLR to tell us if we might have missed something. Although
</I>&gt;<i> antlr is sometimes a bit overzealous. (version 3 will make life quite
</I>&gt;<i> a bit better...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anycase left factoring is usually a good solution to getting rid of
</I>&gt;<i> those warnings. Also
</I>&gt;<i> in this case you get better performance thanks to the left factoring
</I>&gt;<i> since antlr can decide things by looking ahead one token in stead of
</I>&gt;<i> two (or more).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,

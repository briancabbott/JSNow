<PRE>Hey Michael,

In a way I applied a fix, I just don't know if it is the right one. I added
code to check and see if noViableOption printed to the output. Now if there
can be a legal case where noViableOption contains a throw statement and the
howToFinish.needAnErrorClause can be false then yes I have updated my fix to
the unreachable code warnings. I just don't know if that is a legal case.

As for using 2.7.2a4 I was looking at adding the C# codegen to it but the
new 2.7.2a4 files I downloaded have a minor difference so my merge tools
consider the two files completely different so I can't see the changes
required to the base ANTLR files to make sure the merge is clean to add the
C# codegen in. I might get to it later but it will require visual inspection
which is slower.

-Richard

Hi Richard,

&gt;<i> Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is my CSharpCodeGenerator.java. I have coded around the error I 
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned here by making sure the noViableOption string is actually
</I>going to
&gt;<i> get printed to the file.
</I>
Thanks. Are you saying that the file you have attached includes a fix 
for the issue you raised in your original message (in addition to the 
previous two issues) ?

&gt;<i> Sorry about the mix-up on version. I have
</I>&gt;<i> downloaded 2.7.2a4 but I am currently not using it. I applied the
</I>fixes to
&gt;<i> the C# codegen for 2.7.2a2.
</I>
OK. I just thought you had applied the C# codegen to ANTLR 2.7.2a4. 
That's one way to start testing the C# codegen against the latest 
ANTLR version  ;-)

&gt;<i> This version also contains a fix to silence the
</I>&gt;<i> warning:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> warning CS0168: The variable 'pe' is declared but never used
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By adding in a dummy call to pe.getLine();
</I>
OK.

Micheal

<PRE>Something that has been bugging me:

Why do virtually all parser generators produce a warning
for the classic case of if-else ambiguity? It's only technically
ambiguous: there is absolutely only one resolution to the
ambiguity that could possibly make any sense at all,
so warning the user that an ambiguity exists just
wastes the users time -- this is a class of ambiguity
for which the parser generator can make the correct
choice with 100% confidence.

Indeed, it wastes a huge amount of user time even
if you only measure the time spent posting and answering
the same &quot;why is this else ambiguous&quot; question over
and over again (as a quick Google will show). This is
not, as is often claimed, a situation where using a
default of &quot;consuming more input&quot; is &quot;usually what
you want&quot;. This particular example is a case where
there is only one possible choice that could be right.

Part of the problem is people keep explaining the problem
utterly incorrectly. For example, the yacc manual goes
into the if-else ambiguity in great detail, and claims
that the problem is that the else can bind to either
an inner or outer if. That is wrong. The else can only
bind to the inner if.

One can demonstrate that point by taking the example
if-else grammar from the yacc manual and then using
%prec to force it to choose to reduce instead of shift
when it encounters an &quot;else&quot; token. The result is a parser
that produces a syntax error whenever it sees an &quot;else&quot;
token -- no &quot;else&quot; token can ever be consumed. There
were never really two possible choices that could
make sense, there was never any possibility of matching
an &quot;else&quot; to an outer if. There is only one *valid* choice
between the two *technically* ambiguous choices since
the other alternative is, as the Dragon Book says,
&quot;surely wrong&quot;.

There is no doubt that this particular &quot;ambiguity&quot; can
be resolved with 100% confidence 100% automatically,
without wasting endless hours of user time by informing
them that it was &quot;ambiguous&quot;. The only interesting question
is, what is the general category this case belongs to?

Roughly speaking, I think the category is simply those
situations where ambiguity arises because, effectively,
you have the same optional non-terminal adjacent to
itself:
        N? N?

For example, in this grammar:

%token IF ELSE EXPR
%%

stmt
    : if
    | EXPR
    ;

if
    : IF EXPR stmt else_opt
    ;

else_opt    /* optional else */
    : ELSE stmt
    |
    ;

The ambiguity could be identified (by either a top-down
or bottom up parser generator) as occurring in the &quot;if&quot;
production right after &quot;stmt&quot; has been recognized.
However, it can be automatically determined that
the cause is the fact that &quot;stmt&quot; can end with an
optional else, putting two optional else nonterminals
adjacent to each other, which matches the previously
mentioned category -- therefore this is a false
ambiguity.

One can see the problem simplified here:

%token DIGIT
%%
digits
    : '(' DIGIT digit_opt digit_opt ')'
digit_opt  /* optional digit */
    : DIGIT
    | /* epsilon */
    ;

Only one choice for the &quot;ambiguity&quot; can possibly be right;
the alternative is that the parser would never be able to
match any of the optional digits. It will always be the case
when you have two adjacent optional non-terminals that
there is a technically ambiguous choice between either
consuming input, or rendering illegal a token that obviously
should be legal at that point. The correct choice is always
clear, and the alternative could never make sense.

There are many other (at least vaguely related)
cases where a warning absolutely should be
issued, of course:
     N* N*
for example, or
    N* N
or even
    N? O?
where FIRST(N) and FIRST(O) intersect (I'm all for
warning if there's the slightest possibility the user
isn't going to understand what's going to happen).
But for this category I've identified as pseudo
ambiguities, there is no possibility of user confusion,
there is no actual alternative that could ever
possibly make any sense. It is a mere curiosity,
not a true ambiguity.

IMHO, modern parser generators should not be
wasting enormous amounts of total user time by
warning about this class of pseudo ambiguities.
And modern parser generator documentation
should not repeat the utterly incorrect if-else
explanation that implies there is a different
choice that produces anything sensible
whatsoever.

I feel better now. :-)

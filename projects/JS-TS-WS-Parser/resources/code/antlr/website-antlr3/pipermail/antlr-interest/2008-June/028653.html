<PRE>Thanks for the suggestion - I've now got something that works well.

What I've done, as I've traversed the AST of the template declaration  
to replace the template parameters with an actual value, is to build  
up a map of &quot;don't print that token, print this CommonTree instead&quot;.   
When I want to print out the &quot;instantiated&quot; template, I can iterate  
over the Token Stream from getTokenStartIndex() to  
getTokenStopIndex(), printing out each Token, unless it appears in my  
map, in which case I print out the tokens from the  
getTokenStartIndex() to the getTokenStopIndex() of the tree that the  
placeholder was replaced with.

This has precisely the effect that I was after - printing out the  
template verbatim, with all whitespace and comments preserved but with  
the substitutions made.

Thanks,
Geraint.

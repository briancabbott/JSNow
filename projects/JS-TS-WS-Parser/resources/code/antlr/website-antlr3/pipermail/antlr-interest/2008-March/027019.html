<PRE>Gavin,

Thanks for your reply.

Sorry about not left-factoring my grammar; I forgot that this is an
LL-parser generator.

Well, this little example is helping to explain some problems I have
been having.  First, I've noticed that the generated parser seems to
accept illegal input for some grammars.  For example, the empty
language specified in the grammar &quot;grammar does_not_match_empty; e :
;&quot; would accept anything! I now understand that it should have been
&quot;grammar really_matches_empty; e: EOF;&quot;.

In fact, I should think that because one will need to define a grammar
with a production &quot;S' -&gt; S EOF&quot; or some equivalent, ANTLR would do the
construction for me.  Maybe this is part of a feature that I am
unaware of.  But, it is so different from what I'm used to (e.g.,
Yacc) in the LR parser world that I feel that the documentation and
examples should explain this better.  There is no mention of this in
Terr's book &quot;The Definitive ANTLR Reference&quot;.

As a consequence, programming by example using some of the grammars in
the ANTLR Grammar List (<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/grammar/list">http://www.antlr.org/grammar/list</A>) has led me
into trouble.  Three of the five highlighted grammars do not define an
EOF-augmented grammar, including Java.g
(<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/grammar/1152141644268/Java.g">http://www.antlr.org/grammar/1152141644268/Java.g</A>).  Unfortunately,
these grammars can accept illegal input without raising errors!  For
example, with the Java.g grammar, this input is accepted but
obviously illegal Java:

/* beginning of file */
import org.antlr.runtime.*;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    ANTLRInputStream input = new ANTLRInputStream(System.in);
    JavaLexer lexer = new JavaLexer(input);
    CommonTokenStream tokens = new CommonTokenStream(lexer);
    JavaParser parser = new JavaParser(tokens);
    parser.compilationUnit();
    }
}

Here is the beginning of some illegal stuff, but not flagged!
Have a nice day!
/* end of file */

The second problem I was having was the error &quot;no rule can obviously
be followed by EOF&quot;.  Maybe it is because of the common prefix in two
alternatives as you suggested.  But, I think there is a problem in the
ANTLR tool that searches for start symbols and adds end states to the
NFA constructed for the grammar.  This check occurs in the following
ANTLR code:

(In TreeToNFAConverter.java)
    protected void finish() {
        List rules = new LinkedList();
        rules.addAll(grammar.getRules());
        int numEntryPoints = factory.build_EOFStates(rules);
        if ( numEntryPoints==0 ) {
            ErrorManager.grammarWarning(ErrorManager.MSG_NO_GRAMMAR_START_RULE,
                                       grammar,
                                       null,
                                       grammar.name);
        }
    }

(In NFAFactory.java)
   /** add an EOF transition to any rule end NFAState that points to nothing
     *  (i.e., for all those rules not invoked by another rule).  These
     *  are start symbols then.
     *
     *  Return the number of grammar entry points; i.e., how many rules are
     *  not invoked by another rule (they can only be invoked from outside).
     *  These are the start rules.
     */
    public int build_EOFStates(List rules) {
        int numberUnInvokedRules = 0;
        for (Iterator iterator = rules.iterator(); iterator.hasNext();) {
            Rule r = (Rule) iterator.next();
            String ruleName = r.name;
            NFAState endNFAState = nfa.grammar.getRuleStopState(ruleName);
            // Is this rule a start symbol?  (no follow links)
            if ( endNFAState.transition(0)==null ) {
                // if so, then don't let algorithm fall off the end of
                // the rule, make it hit EOF/EOT.
                /*
                if ( nfa.grammar.type==Grammar.LEXER ) {
                    return; // 11/28/2005: try having only Tokens with EOT 
transition
                }
                if ( nfa.grammar.type!=Grammar.LEXER ||
                     ruleName.equals(Grammar.ARTIFICIAL_TOKENS_RULENAME) )
                {
                    build_EOFState(endNFAState);
                }
                */
                build_EOFState(endNFAState);
                // track how many rules have been invoked by another rule
                numberUnInvokedRules++;
            }
        }
        return numberUnInvokedRules;
    }

(In NFAFactory.java)
    /** set up an NFA NFAState that will yield eof tokens or,
     *  in the case of a lexer grammar, an EOT token when the conversion
     *  hits the end of a rule.
     */
    private void build_EOFState(NFAState endNFAState) {
        NFAState end = newState();
        int label = Label.EOF;
        if ( nfa.grammar.type==Grammar.LEXER ) {
            label = Label.EOT;
            end.setEOTTargetState(true);
        }
        /*
        System.out.println(&quot;build &quot;+nfa.grammar.getTokenDisplayName(label)+
                           &quot; loop on end of state 
&quot;+endNFAState.getDescription()+
                           &quot; to state &quot;+end.stateNumber);
        */
        Transition toEnd = new Transition(label, end);
        endNFAState.addTransition(toEnd);
    }

Unfortunately, with the grammar &quot;grammar test; a : 'A' a | 'A' ;&quot;, the
NFA constructed contains cycles so endNFAState.transition(0) is never
null, numberUnInvokedRules is never incremented in build_EOFStates(),
and the error message is printed.  One could simply add the rule &quot;xxx:
;&quot; to almost any grammar to bypass the error!  Debugging ANTLR using
the &quot;test&quot; grammar, it seems to me that the check isn't quite correct
because the NFA constructed should have labeled the NFA state after
the 'A' transition from the 2nd alternative as an &quot;end&quot; state.  But,
then again, I'm not sure how end states are labeled in ANTLR.

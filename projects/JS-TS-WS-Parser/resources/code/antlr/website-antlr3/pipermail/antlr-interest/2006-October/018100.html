</I>&gt;<i>I've thought a lot about this idea of having a generic intermediate

</I>&gt;<i>a couple of products that say they do this. I can't see how to make it

</I>&gt;<i>No way to know, unless we also store that information, so we add some

</I>&gt;<i>generic representation. The guy working on the generic-to-Java part 
</I>&gt;<i>demands that the
</I>&gt;<i>guy working on the COBOL-to-generic part stores that information, even 
</I>&gt;<i>though it's
</I>&gt;<i>meaningless to the COBOL guy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Then, the next day, the generic-to-Java guy realizes that A can be any 
</I>&gt;<i>arbitrary expression,
</I>&gt;<i>and that the expression must be evaluated first, before the assignment 
</I>&gt;<i>is made. He starts
</I>&gt;<i>going to make the generic representation more generic, and the COBOL 
</I>&gt;<i>sees him and says
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;WTF are you doing? You can only add two numbers! I'm not going to deal 
</I>&gt;<i>with your
</I>&gt;<i>complicated data structure, I just want to store the fact that you're 
</I>&gt;<i>adding one number to another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>And then the next day, the problem goes the other way. The COBOL guy 
</I>&gt;<i>realizes that
</I>&gt;<i>the Java guy is going to need to know that B is 10 digits before the 
</I>&gt;<i>decimal, 5 after the decimal,
</I>&gt;<i>and a particular precision. The Java guy eventually realizes
</I>&gt;<i>that he can't even use &quot;B += A&quot;, he's got to use BigDecimal. That 
</I>&gt;<i>doesn't bother him so much
</I>&gt;<i>as the term &quot;digits&quot;.  &quot;You're going to tell me how many 'digits' it 
</I>&gt;<i>is???&quot; He screams.
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;Don't you mean bytes?&quot; No, he really does mean &quot;digits&quot;. And you 
</I>&gt;<i>haven't seen nothin' yet,
</I>&gt;<i>Java guy. Wait till he tells you how to store those digits on disk in 
</I>&gt;<i>packed decimal format.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So in the end, the &quot;generic representation&quot; can't really be &quot;generic&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i>The Java guy just wants to know
</I>&gt;<i>whether a variable is a &quot;int&quot; or a &quot;long&quot;, while the COBOL guy wants to 
</I>&gt;<i>say how many digits it is
</I>&gt;<i>before and after the decimal. OK, I suppose you could make it generic, 
</I>&gt;<i>you can store both,
</I>&gt;<i>or have the &quot;generic representation&quot; automatically
</I>&gt;<i>convert between the two. But things are going very badly and you just 
</I>&gt;<i>got started :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I've been wanting to say this, ever since Monty said &quot;AREV and VB are 
very different&quot; ...

Look at the following snippet of AREV code (bear in mind that : is the 
string concatenation operator, and all variables in AREV are strings...)

X = X : 0

What do you think the programmer meant?



















In VB, this *probably* translates as

int X
X = X*10

Of course, if the AREV guy accidentally put a real number in X, then it 
would have no effect at all, and if he'd put text in X he'd have 
appended a 0 to it (note that in the original code, the 0 wasn't quoted, 
so it was a number not a string ...).

Your point about the programmer's original intent was well made, Andy 
:<i>-) (and no I'm not suggesting programmers should write code like that, 
</I>but as someone who programs in that language, I make use of that sort of 
trick)

Cheers,
Wol

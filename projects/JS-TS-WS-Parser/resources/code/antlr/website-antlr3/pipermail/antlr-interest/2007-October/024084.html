<PRE>Hi,
 
The code generated by the C# code gen in 3.1 (and all other 3.1-ready
targets too, I suspect) requires a 3.1 runtime. The runtime API has changed
(mostly to satisfy the grammar import feature). The RecognizerSharedState is
one such change.
 
The combination of the C# codegen and runtime for 3.1 in the depot (as of
when I checked it in) when used together were probably alpha-to-early_beta
quality. Once Johannes et al complete the update/testing of examples-v3 for
C#, it should be closer to release quality.
 
For now, use the 3.0 dlls with the 3.x C# codegen or, build and use the new
3.1 runtime from the depot contents along with the 3.1 templates in the
depot. The Nant build is currently broken after Johannes' recent check-ins
so, use VS.NET (or #Develop) to build the runtime.

Actually, the previous version does work perfectly. It seems that there is
now something called ParserSharedState in which the fsp is kept, but it is
either not inherited or not public enough for the generated code to use it.
Is the current code supposed to be usable with the source code based
runtime, or is it in some quasi-state at the moment?

Guys,

 

It seesm that the runtime binary that was working (for me at least) has
gone, so I built the C# runtime from the source code that was there. However
the generated code now seesm to complain that followingStackPointer_ does
not exist in the current context.

 

Before I revert to the previous version, does anyone know why this might
suddenly be the case or is it just that the C# .sln for VS2005 that is now
in the depot is no quite up to scratch, or something else altogether?

 

Jim

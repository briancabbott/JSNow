<PRE>&gt;<i> yup i did. my codes are as follows:
</I>
OK.

[Once again, I have just looked at the code so I might have missed 
something.]

I looked at the code and applied it to the only sample you've given 
of the data you wish to parse (from Msg# 7128):

angle focus : 0.0005
color : blue
line width : 12

Looking at your grammar, this data generate errors because:
1. &quot;angle focus&quot; is not a keyword (keyphrase?), but &quot;angle factor&quot; is.
2. &quot;color&quot; is not a keyword, but &quot;initial color&quot; is.
3. &quot;line width&quot; is not a keyword, but &quot;initial line width&quot; is.
4. &quot;0.0005&quot; will be matched as two NUMERIC tokens.

The problem in [4] above lies within the following rules (I assume 
that [1], [2] and [3] are obvious):

protected SYMBOL : ('-'|'+'|'%'|'/'|'.'|',')+;
protected DIGIT   : ( '0'..'9' ) ; 
NUMERIC :(SYMBOL)? (DIGIT)+ (SYMBOL DIGIT)* 

This says that a NUMERIC has:
a) an optional leading SYMBOL followed by
b) one or more DIGITs followed by
c) zero or more SYMBOL-DIGIT sequences

e.g: (In examples SY means SYMBOL and DG means DIGIT)

Hence the following are VALID numerics:
1) %0000.9+8/%..+7 ==&gt; %=[SY] 0000=[(DG)+] .9+8/%..+7=[(SY DG)*]
                       { since .9=[SY DG] +8=[SY DG] /%..+7=[SY DG] }

2) 10 ==&gt; no-leading-SY 10=[(DG+)]

3) -10 ==&gt; -=[SY] 10=[(DG+)]

4) /+,,-%..10 ==&gt; /+,,-%..=[SY] 10=[(DG+)]

And the following are INVALID numerics:
1) 0.0005 ==&gt; no-leading-SY 0=[(DG)+] .0=[(DG)*] &lt;NUMERIC-MATCHED&gt;
              no-leading-SY 005=[(DG+)]          &lt;NUMERIC-MATCHED&gt;

2) -10.10 ==&gt; -=[SY] 10=[(DG)+] .1=[(DG)*] &lt;NUMERIC-MATCHED&gt;
              no-leading-SY 0=[(DG+)]      &lt;NUMERIC-MATCHED&gt;

So, the keywords are being correctly indentified as keywords and not 
identifiers but some of your rules need more work to better reflect 
the true syntax/semantics of the language (i.e data) you are trying 
to parse.

I suspect for instance that NUMERIC would be better written as:

protected SIGN   : ('-'|'+');
protected SYMBOL : (SIGN|'%'|'/'|'.');
protected DIGIT  : ( '0'..'9' ) ; 
NUMERIC          : (SIGN)? (DIGIT)+ (SYMBOL (DIGIT)+)* 

This says that a NUMERIC has:
a) an optional leading SIGN followed by
b) one or more DIGITs followed by
c) zero or more sequences of: a SYMBOL followed by one or more DIGITs

I removed ',' from SYMBOL, because I didn't know what it meant. You 
would know that and should put it back in the right place. If it 
means &quot;comma-separated list of NUMERIC&quot;, perhaps it should be handled 
in the parser?

Once again, have a look at Ter's Getting started guide and the 
tutorials it links to. Also look at the examples directory for ideas. 
The java grammar for instance has a good, well-tested rule for C/C++-
style multiline comments. Your version would report incorrect line 
numbers for all rules after a multiline comment.

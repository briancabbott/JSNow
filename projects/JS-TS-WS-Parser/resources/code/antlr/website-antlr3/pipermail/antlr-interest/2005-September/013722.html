<PRE>As far as I recall, Prashant never said it would be free. The &quot;video-only&quot;
previews were just to demonstrate what he was doing and gauge interest. 

RE &quot;testing a commercial product&quot;, have you never heard of public betas?
Many many many commercial products have public betas, and some even ask that
you pay to participate (the M$ office betas, for example).

Absolutely nothing wrong with this, so please chill...

Prashant has chatted with me about price possibilities, and he's looking to
keep it inexpensive. I told him it's a very niche market and that he may not
sell many unless the price is very low, and even then he probably wouldn't
sell many.

I think you should view it more as a &quot;payware&quot; tool than a commercial
product (as he's not doing this as a business).

I do recommend that if you think ANTLRStudio may be potentially useful that
you send a note to Prashant stating what you would be willing to pay for a
tool like that, as it may help him set a price.

Later,

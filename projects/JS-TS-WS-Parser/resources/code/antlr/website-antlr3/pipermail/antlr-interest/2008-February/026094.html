<PRE>Thanks again very much for the explanations.

&gt;<i> The cardinality of a rewrite rule element must match the cardinality of 
</I>&gt;<i> the actual element.  In the case above, you're telling the rewrite 
</I>&gt;<i> engine that &quot;elements&quot; might not have any value, so it needs to insert a 
</I>&gt;<i> test to check for that before inserting it into the tree.  Had you left 
</I>&gt;<i> the ? out, it treats it as an assertion that &quot;elements&quot; always has 
</I>&gt;<i> exactly one value and thus won't include the test (for performance 
</I>&gt;<i> reasons), which will lead to a runtime exception if it turns out that it 
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't actually supplied.
</I>
Wonderful! As you pointed out farther down, that was the reason for the
RewriteEmptyStreamException I posted earlier, not the presence of multiple 
lines in the input (there was a &quot;[]&quot; in my inputs).

&gt;&gt;<i> Expr.g in &#167; 3.3 of the book does just that, though. Isn't that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what the NEWLINE as a stat option is for?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't seen that example
</I>
I have attached it. You don't need the book to get it, as all the
code from the book is available somewhere on the ANTLR site as a
zip file.

&gt;<i> In particular, if you have both a NEWLINE and a WS rule
</I>
But I need a WS because I want to allow superfluous spaces anywhere,
e.g. not just [1,2], [1, 2], [ 1 , 2 ] etc etc without encumbering
the array rule with ( *) and such.

&gt;<i> It's not that unhelpful 
</I>
OK, maybe with experience one can decode it but do all runtime
problems lead to blowups? Why doesn't it just say &quot;Invalid input:
[] at line 3&quot; or some such?

-- O.L.

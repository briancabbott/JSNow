<PRE>Hi Tom,

&gt;<i> Is that going to work? I think you'll need to have a rule that
</I>&gt;<i> matches those particular characters. Literal matching only happens
</I>&gt;<i> to the match of rules, not to every character on the input stream.
</I>
Nothing changes in the way lexer looks. Of course the lexer will have a rule
---
EQUALS: '=';
---

and since it imports parser's vocabulary and tests the literals on this rule 
it will return the right token for &quot;=&quot;.

Unfortunatelly you'll have in the tokens table something like:

---
&quot;=&quot;=6
&quot;;&quot;=7
EQ=8
SEMI=9
---

If you assign a token in the parser to &quot;=&quot;

---
tokens {
   ASSIGN=&quot;=&quot;;
};

than the token table (by Lexer which imports parsers vocabulary) will look 
like:
---
ASSIGN=&quot;=&quot;=6
&quot;;&quot;=7
EQ=8
SEMI=9
---

It's kind of strange indeed...

&gt;<i> Having a rule which matched the characters used as literalswould
</I>&gt;<i> mean you'd have to maintain it. So you probably want to add a rule
</I>&gt;<i> that matches all characters that aren't matched in other rules,
</I>&gt;<i> probably just all non alpha-numeric, less maintenance, though you'd
</I>&gt;<i> have to have to have your own literal matching that threw an
</I>&gt;<i> exception if there was no match, or you'd have weird invalid tokens
</I>&gt;<i> coming through. Then there's the issue of making that informative.
</I>
I was thinking about leaving the lexer as it is. Nothing changes there. If 
there is no rule ASSIGN, than the &quot;=&quot; token in the parser vocabulary will 
never show up.

&gt;<i> And when something breaks in your parser with handling those it
</I>&gt;<i> could be wierdness related to the literals handling.
</I>
This is what I am interested in. What if something breaks in the parser?
Missing tokens are the only thing that comes to my mind, and missing &quot;=&quot; is 
clearly reported.... Unless I am missing something here...

&gt;<i> True you don't have to remember the token name, but
</I>&gt;<i> only in the parser, so you've got this weird stuff going on in the
</I>&gt;<i> parser, somehow these tokens don't really have labels, you can't do
</I>&gt;<i> this your tree parsers
</I>
1) in your tree parsers you may carry on &quot;=&quot; same way as you would carry on 
any literal (&quot;try&quot;, &quot;class&quot;...)
2) if you want to create new nodes using the &quot;=&quot; token in the parser, 
apparently you can specify the token for it in the tokens section:

---
tokens {
    ASSIGN=&quot;=&quot;;
}
---

And it works, even if you get an warning at compile time:

---
ANTLR Parser Generator   Version 2.7.2   1989-2003 jGuru.com
LookWalker.g:14:12: warning:Redefinition of token in tokens {...}: ASSIGN
---

3) anyway, creating nodes like 'a new for loop' in your AST means using 
'LITERAL_for' which is not a very short name to type. 

Ideally one could build a node specifying the string (at least in case of 
literals). Something like #[&quot;class&quot;], not limited to #[LITERAL_class] or 
#[LITERAL_class, &quot;class&quot;].

&gt;<i>  But I guess it's partly a matter of taste,
</I>&gt;<i> but I'd be worried about how maintainable any code like that is, for
</I>&gt;<i> you and then more so for others.
</I>
This is my concern as well and I guess I'll have to look deeper into this 
before starting (if I'll start) to use this approach.

Thanks,
Cristian

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello guys,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Case:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    o sometimes I kind of foreget what name I gave to the &quot;=&quot; token
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> from the
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lexer (EQ/EQUAL/EQUALS/ASSIGN) when I want to add a new rule to a
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> parser.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    o sometimes I get bored to write LCURLEY instead of &quot;{&quot; or '{'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    o sometimes it's hard for me to follow rules full of SEMI, LCURL
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (E)?Y,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; LBRACK, LPARENS and so on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For example, I would like to see my parser rules look like:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assign:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         ID &quot;=&quot;^ ID &quot;;&quot;!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     ;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I browsed throw the documentation/big examples, yet I couldn't
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> find any
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; similar approach as a guideline or something.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yet, it doesn't seem impossible (see the attached files).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Although the parsers token table won't have a token type attached
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> to &quot;=&quot; (I
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; asssume LITERAL_= is not a valid id in almost any language), it
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> reserves a
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; number for it. Now importing the parsers vocabulary in the lexer,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and leaving
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; testLiterals true (default value) it seems that the lexer's token
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> table keeps
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the number from the parser for &quot;=&quot; and adds to it a token type
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (EQUAL/EQ/ASSIGN, oops I don't remember).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are there any disadvantages/risks related to this approach?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Of course, in the parser, if somebody likes to build new AST nodes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> using &quot;=&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it may attach it a token type in the tokens section and use it...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Either I am a maniac, or the parser gramar looks much clearer to
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> me...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And the walkers import the lexers vocabulary (see the attached
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> files).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Or it's just a matter of taste?

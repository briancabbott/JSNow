<PRE>The problem is that your rules are ambiguous with fixed look-ahead,
which is what antlr 2 uses.  Given 4 digits and k=4 look-ahead, either
rule could match, hence the warning when compiling the grammar.  You
need a semantic predicate to disambiguate it:
 
APAC_NUMERIC_TICKER 
    : (DIGIT+ COMMA) =&gt; ((DIGIT)+ (COMMA) (CHAR) (CHAR)) 
    ; 

The sample input you give is precisely where it is ambiguous.  1350
looks like 4 digits, which will match NUMBER or the beginning of
APAC_NUMBER_TICKER.

ANTLR 2.7.7
	
	

	Hi, 
	
	I get the following warning when building my lexer from
stragegy.g: 
	
	/Grammar/strategy.g: warning:lexical nondeterminism between
rules NUMBER and APAC_NUMERIC_TICKER upon 
	./Grammar/strategy.g:     k==1:'0'..'9' 
	./Grammar/strategy.g:     k==2:'0'..'9' 
	./Grammar/strategy.g:     k==3:'0'..'9' 
	./Grammar/strategy.g:     k==4:'0'..'9' 
	
	Passing the following string fails: 
	
	&quot;spx dec 1350 c 43 44&quot; 
	
	As it takes 1350 to be an APAC_NUMERIC_TICKER when I it to be
considered to be a NUMBER.  Interestingly, the following works: 
	
	&quot;spx dec 135 c 43 44&quot; 
	
	My definition for the lexer rule is: 
	
	APAC_NUMERIC_TICKER 
	    : ((DIGIT)+ (COMMA) (CHAR) (CHAR)) 
	    ; 
	
	I want this to only be used if a string entered &quot;has at least
one DIGIT and is followed by a COMMA then two CHARs&quot;.  This is clearly
not the case for the string 1350 - and yet it matches,  and then throws
the exception: 
	
	
antlr.TokenStreamRecognitionException: expecting ',', found ' '



	Can anyone suggest a way to only match this rule if it is in the
correct format ((DIGIT)+ (COMMA) (CHAR) (CHAR)) ? 
	
	Thanks in advance, 
	
	Clive 
	
	
	
	Attached is my grammar file.

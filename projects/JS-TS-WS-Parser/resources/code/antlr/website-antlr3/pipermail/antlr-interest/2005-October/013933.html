<PRE>Hi Akhilesh,

OK, I see what you're saying now. Split BaseAST into two: a base class
that has no reference to &quot;down&quot; and &quot;right&quot; fields, and a subclass that 
does.

I guess that makes sense. A couple of things though:
*  the subclass will need to be called BaseAST and not the base class,
or else everyone's code will break.
* You'll still want the &quot;type&quot; and &quot;text&quot; fields in the base class, I 
assume -
I can't imagine an AST that doesn't need these
* I'm still having trouble picturing why you would want to implement
these &quot;down&quot; and &quot;right&quot; fields any other way. I don't doubt that you need
to do it, I'm just saying I can't picture it. So in the end, it may not 
be worth
it for Terrence to fold in this change, because you may be the only
person who ends up needing/wanting it. I know there's no real harm in
him doing it, but it does add a little complexity.

And in defense of BaseAST (and it's author :), it's certainly not 
obvious that
someone might not want to keep &quot;down&quot; and &quot;right&quot; fields, and in fact I 
suspect
that you may be the only user who wants/needs to. So I think the
&quot;this BaseAST design is awful&quot; is unwarranted. Making your change may
be an improvement, but the current design has worked just fine for every 
ANTLR user
for many years, AFAICT.

</I>&gt;<i>concrete implementations of set/getFirstChild() and
</I>&gt;<i>set/getFirstSibling() etc. How the concrete class
</I>&gt;<i>implements them is again of no concern of BaseAST. The
</I>&gt;<i>contract from AST interface says they return an
</I>&gt;<i>instance of type AST... so as long as it is fulfilled
</I>&gt;<i>by concrete class everything should be fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>But BaseAST itself implements the tree
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>relationships, not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>your subclass.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thats what is wrong. BaseAST should not do it. It
</I>&gt;<i>implements just the algorithms, which should have
</I>&gt;<i>nothing to do with how data is *actually* stored.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>If you want to do that yourself, you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>shouldn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>be subclassing BaseAST.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>But there is problem with it. BaseAST implements a ton
</I>&gt;<i>of algorithms which work just fine. They are tested
</I>&gt;<i>and would work (may not be most optimally) whatever
</I>&gt;<i>way data is stored. I don't want to reimplement (and
</I>&gt;<i>debug) them again... I don't even want to copy/paste
</I>&gt;<i>them in MyBaseAST (which will be *identical* to
</I>&gt;<i>BaseAST with the two fields less).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So eg, addChild() would work fine even if childs are
</I>&gt;<i>stored in a doubly linked list, however, if the
</I>&gt;<i>implementer wants better performance she/he might
</I>&gt;<i>choose to implement it in fashion that gives O(1) 
</I>&gt;<i>performance rather than O(n) which is right now.
</I>&gt;<i>Again, it is implementer's choice.

<PRE>&gt;<i> I can understand why you would not want this restriction. Actually 
</I>&gt;<i> it is not a .NET exe that is important; a native exe would do. From 
</I>&gt;<i> the perspective of people who only wish to use Antlr, and not build 
</I>&gt;<i> it, the JVM dependency is a hefty bit of luggage with its own 
</I>&gt;<i> versioning issues.
</I>
You are absolutely correct about the usefulness of native binaries 
for the ANTLR tool itself.

&gt;<i> That is all I meant. Many .NET developers don't 
</I>&gt;<i> use the JVM at all anymore, except for things like Antlr.
</I>
;-)

I actually agree with you on this. Unfortunately, J# is the only 
option available to me currently. GCJ doesn't do Windows executables 
AFAICT and I don't have TowerJ, JOVE or other similar Java-NativeCode 
compilers that do support recent versions of the Java2 platform.

Perhaps someone on the list does?

<PRE>Hi Don

Thanks for this great overview. It seems that the whole process is a lot 
harder than I would have thought :-(. I'll see if I can find any simpler 
ways of achieving my goal and if not I'll use your hints and tips.

Again, thanks heaps.

</I>&gt;<i> I've built a language package for VS that uses Antlr.  It is a commercial
</I>&gt;<i> product so I can't share the code, but I can give you a few tips.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You'll need a lexer for syntax highlighting.  There's no need for a parser,
</I>&gt;<i> the language service just needs a sequence of tokens with certain
</I>&gt;<i> information such as the starting column and length, the text type (i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> text, comment, etc.), and some other things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The lexer is called once for each line of source code, so it should be as
</I>&gt;<i> simple and efficient as possible (e.g. don't use semantic predicates), and
</I>&gt;<i> you should reuse the same lexer instance for the entire time your package is
</I>&gt;<i> loaded.   You don't want to create a new instance of the lexer each time it
</I>&gt;<i> is needed, the initialization costs are very high (especially the init of
</I>&gt;<i> the tokens table) and it will slow down typing and scrolling in the editor
</I>&gt;<i> if it isn't very efficient.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I use a static stringstream object to feed the lexer and just reinitialize
</I>&gt;<i> it each time the lexer is called.  In addition, you need to call
</I>&gt;<i> lex-&gt;setColumn(0) and lex-&gt;getInputBuffer().reset() to &quot;reset&quot; the lexer
</I>&gt;<i> each time you need to parse a new line.  You don't need to worry about the
</I>&gt;<i> line counter, since you will never be parsing more than one line at a time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You also do not want to ignore comments in this lexer (since they must be
</I>&gt;<i> colorized too) and you must maintain state for multiline comments and you
</I>&gt;<i> cannot assume that when you encounter the beginning of a ML-comment you will
</I>&gt;<i> find the end.  The end might be on a different line and you only get to lex
</I>&gt;<i> one line at a time, so you must return a state code to the language service,
</I>&gt;<i> which it will then return to you when it asks you to tokenize the next line.
</I>&gt;<i> You must structure your lexer to be able to be entered in a state where you
</I>&gt;<i> are within a multiline comment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If your language has any other constructs that can span multiple lines (like
</I>&gt;<i> literal strings in C/C++) then you must maintain state for that as well.
</I>&gt;<i> You cannot assume that you will be lexing each line in sequence, or if you
</I>&gt;<i> will be lexing any particular line at all.  The language service maintains
</I>&gt;<i> your returned state code for each line that has been colorized, and you will
</I>&gt;<i> always be given the state code for the preceding line when you are asked to
</I>&gt;<i> lex another line.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To get tokens without using a parser, do something like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    RefToken tok = lex-&gt;nextToken();
</I>&gt;<i>    while ( tok-&gt;getType() != Token::EOF_TYPE )
</I>&gt;<i>    {
</I>&gt;<i>       // ...
</I>&gt;<i>       tok = lex-&gt;nextToken();
</I>&gt;<i>    }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Next, you will need another lexer and a parser to support code collapsing,
</I>&gt;<i> intellisense and various other things that the VS editor supports.  This is
</I>&gt;<i> more like a traditional parser, where you want to ignore comments and
</I>&gt;<i> whitespace.  You will be asked to parse all, or part of the source file.
</I>&gt;<i> Rules in your parser will have to return the proper information to the
</I>&gt;<i> language service, depending on the reason for the parse.  There are numerous
</I>&gt;<i> reasons for invoking a full or partial parse (code collapsing, intellisense,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.).  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If your parser is efficient enough, it is easier to parse the entire source
</I>&gt;<i> file each time, but the language service will also give you the coordinates
</I>&gt;<i> of only the text that's changed.  You can maintain state information and
</I>&gt;<i> only parse the changed source or parse the entire source file each time.
</I>&gt;<i> Although colorizing and intellisense operations are generally called on
</I>&gt;<i> background threads, you want them to be as efficient as possible so there is
</I>&gt;<i> no noticeable delay to the end user.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This lexer and parser generally does not need to be as thorough as those
</I>&gt;<i> used in a compiler.  You only need to parse things to a point that you can
</I>&gt;<i> supply the needed information back to the language service.  So, you don't
</I>&gt;<i> really need to be concerned with things like operator precedence and things
</I>&gt;<i> of that nature that are only significant if you are actually going to
</I>&gt;<i> generate code.  Again, you want to make this as efficient as possible so
</I>&gt;<i> there is no noticeable delay to the end user.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some language services like C# actually attempt to do a background compile
</I>&gt;<i> (minus codegen) while you type, so that syntax and semantic errors can be
</I>&gt;<i> displayed in real time in the error list pane.  That requires a more through
</I>&gt;<i> parser that does semantic analysis, type resolution and so forth, and you
</I>&gt;<i> may want to generate and persist an AST if you attempt this.  Some of C#'s
</I>&gt;<i> advanced intellisense features also require this level of parsing.  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Writing a Visual Studio language (or project) package is not a trivial thing
</I>&gt;<i> to undertake, especially given the quality of the sample code and
</I>&gt;<i> documentation that's provided, so be prepared for a bit of work.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi All
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I want to build a new language integration tool for VS2005. I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want to integrate Latex into VS (I'm lazy, I'm spoiled and I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need my code complete thingies ;-). However to do that I need 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a parser and a lexer. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The documents assume you use Flex and Bison, however I was 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thinking about Antlr. So now my questions are:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Has anybody ever build a language package for VS with antlr
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Has anybody ever created a LaTex grammar?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Has anybody ever tried to create those two things.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also if anybody has any hints or tips I would love to hear those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regards
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; I think it would be good if antlr
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would provide .NET version of tool. Especially for people who 
</I>only 
&gt;<i> use the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; C#  version (me). It's easier to integrate into VS and is only 
</I>one 
&gt;<i> 500K
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; executable file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I agree strongly. If you don't use Java for anything else, it

Hmmm,.....&quot;just another maintenance burden&quot; is an unfair 
characterization of Java with respect to ANTLR usage even on 
purely .NET projects. Nevertheless, I have wanted to eliminate Java 
entirely on many occasions in the past too. In fact, we had a .NET 
executable available - courtesy of J# - long before ANTLR/C# was 
born. It is seldom used today.

If a decision is taken to _always_ produce a .NET executable of the 
ANTLR tool itself using J#, hidden within that is an implicit 
assumption then that ANTLR would restrict itself to using JDK1.1.4 
features only. Otherwise we end up with two code bases.

Personally, I can see no strong arguments in favour of such a 
restriction just to support the availability of a .NET executable. 

Of course, if a robust Java-to-CIL compiler were to become 
available.....

Cheers,

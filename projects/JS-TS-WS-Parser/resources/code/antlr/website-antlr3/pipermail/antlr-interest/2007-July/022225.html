<PRE>Hi,
 
Just a thought, does Ter's mantra language project count as &quot;complex&quot;
enough?. It has a website that is referenced from the V3 download page.
 
On project documentation, ANTLR can always benefit from more hands manning
the wiki pumps so to speak. You can help with improving the wiki
documentation as you learn ANTLR. You seem to have a good idea what is
needed to better help new users and beginners.
 
Have you reported the ANTLR3 bugs you mentioned in your footnote?

Subject: [antlr-interest] Comments on ANTLR book


I am dissapointed by the book.


Why? because the examples are not really helping. The easy concepts are easy
to grasp without the book and the advanced ones lack adequate examples.

If i were Ter, i would have constructed with the book a complex parser, for
let's say SQL. I would have touched all the features of ANTLR and showed HOW
CONCEPTS are applied.

When I have problems, I google for it, when dispair comes I post here ...
but i feel i don't have a complete example where i can look and even
&quot;borrow&quot; some patterns. 

And I feel this is exactly what is lacking to the ANTLR project: a very good
HELP that is targeted to the beginners, and that goes step by step.

Most of the times I either find too complex things or too simple ones. 


PS: ANTLR3 is fantastic, even with its bugs. ANTLRWorks is so slow on
windows...

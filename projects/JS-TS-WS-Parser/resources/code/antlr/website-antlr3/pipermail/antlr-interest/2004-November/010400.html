Yes, I had looked at that early on. If you have
more details written up (or have the code
laying around), I'd love to see it.

I think what makes my situation different is the approach I took.
The example you give on that page says you change this:
IF R.CUST.ADDR[1,6] = 'PO BOX'
...to this...
IF (arvEQ(arvSUBSTRING(arvEXTRACT(R_CUST_ADDR, CUA_ADDR_LN1, 0, 0), 1,
6), &quot;PO BOX&quot;)

I made a decision early on that I wanted to generate Java code
that looks hand written, even at the expense of possibly not
being correct code! I have a lot of writeup on this at my website.
The other C-to-Java tools (e.g. C2J and Ephedra) do what you're
doing here: generate code that works correctly, but is not at
all what a person would write.

So try to write down the VB code as you would
write it manually, and then figure out how you would do that
translation, and see if a treewalker is still a good fit.
Maybe it will be for you, but I guess I never got comfortable
enough with treewalkers (and I guess ANTLR in general) to
make it a good fit for me.

And thanks so much for writing the cgram grammar - don't know
where I'd be without it (perhaps still at a &quot;real job&quot; :)

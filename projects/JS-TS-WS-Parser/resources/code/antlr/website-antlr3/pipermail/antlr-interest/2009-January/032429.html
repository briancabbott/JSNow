Hmm. I thought I had a pretty good grasp of C++. It lacks a &quot;finally&quot;  
keyword, which means you implement automatic-code-execution-on-scope- 
exit with RAII. This requires instantiating objects on the stack at  
appropriate places. This is fine, if sometimes cumbersome, but I  
wanted to avoid letting someone put &quot;finally&quot; in their grammar.

Yeah, I love C++, really, but I disagree with the creators/sustainers  
on a few issues. This is one. I love that I can use RAII, and often it  
is better, but frequently you have one-off cleanup that is much more  
compactly written in a finally clause. There's no good reason not to  
have both.

An interesting approach, but a bit icky, don't you think? If you can  
guarantee a superclass to the exceptions, it could be a bit tidier,  
perhaps, but really, C++? Can't we just have finally already? :-)

Anyway, I guess I have my answer. Thanks!

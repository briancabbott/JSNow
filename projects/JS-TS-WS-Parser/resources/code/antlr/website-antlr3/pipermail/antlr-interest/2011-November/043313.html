<PRE>Greetings!

First 2 caveats then see discussion below:

1) I do not know C#. all of my suggestions are based on the Java target.

2) My suggestions are from memory. I have not actually tested them (or
rather I have tested them in the past on other problems and hope memory
works).

use whatever sub-string functionality is available in C# to remove the
first and last characters from the string. but do so at the last
possible moment.

generally, any time you have a cardinality meta-operator (the ? * or +)
in the syntax portion of a rule, you will want a similar cardinality
operator in the re-write portion of that rule.

thus a first try at a re-write rule is:

array: '[' FLOAT+ | STRING+ ']' -&gt; ^(ARRAY FLOAT+ STRING+) ;

the separate lists on the right of the -&gt; work because your syntax
specifies separate lists.

and i guess this first try really reduces to this rule:

array : '['^ FLOAT+ | STRING+ ']'! ;



note that you can use the += operator to accumulate lists of things. but
these lists are homogeneous (e.g. all of the elements in the list must
be of the same type).

and in this specific case both of your lists are lists of Tokens, so a
second try at a re-write rule is:

array: '[' (t+=FLOAT)+ | (t+=STRING)+ ']' -&gt; ^(ARRAY $t+) ;


to me both of the above are not good choices because information that
the parser immediately has about the type of the elements in the array
is not explicitly placed into the tree.

so i would have 2 imaginary tokens ARRAY_FLOAT and ARRAY_STRING and use
this rule:

array
    : ( l='[' (f+=FLOAT)+  ']' -&gt; ^(ARRAY_FLOAT [&quot;FLT ARY&quot;,$l] $f+) )
    | ( l='[' (s+=STRING)+ ']' -&gt; ^(ARRAY_STRING[&quot;STR ARY&quot;,$l] $s+) )
  ;

i think this last form will simplify subsequent processing of the tree.
note also the proper initialization of the imaginary tokens.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> fragment LETTER : '$'| 'A'..'Z' | 'a'..'z' | '_' ;
</I>&gt;<i> fragment DIGITS : ('0'..'9')+;
</I>&gt;<i> fragment EXP : ('e'|'E') ('+'|'-')? ('0'..'9')+ ;
</I>&gt;<i> STRING : '&quot;' ( ~('&quot;') )* '&quot;' ;
</I>&gt;<i> ID  :   LETTER (LETTER|DIGITS)*;
</I>&gt;<i> FLOAT :  (DIGITS? '.' DIGITS EXP?) | (DIGITS EXP?) ;
</I>&gt;<i> WS  :   (' '|'\t'|'\n'|'\r')+ {Skip();} ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Hope this helps...

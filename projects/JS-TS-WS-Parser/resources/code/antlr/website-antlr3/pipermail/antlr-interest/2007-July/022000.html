Finally!  Given the current state of affairs in this country and 
around the world, I for one very much look forward to Terence 
continuing (that is, beginning with the unholy &quot;book&quot;) to work his 
pernicious deeds and insidious machinations to swiftly achieve world 
domination by defeating the Berne/capitalist/communist conspiracy, 
and forming a more perfect union of information publishing houses 
that pay the insider information elite more than $3 a copy.

You know this destiny to be true and inevitable.  Need you look any 
further than Terence's own picture so blatantly published on the 
antlr.org masthead.  Truly the face and antics of an evil genius if 
ever there was one.

Thanks, Scott, for injecting a bit of levity into the list.  BTW, I 
very much appreciate your documentation of some of the inner details 
of Java Bean Attributes and property editors.  I have made use of it 
many times over the years.  Always thought you could write a much 
more expansive and detailed Beans book than all of those I have 
bought over the years.  Seriously.

Best,
Gerald

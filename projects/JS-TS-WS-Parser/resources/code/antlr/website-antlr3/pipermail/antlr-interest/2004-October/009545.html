Greetings,

    This is more of a compiler question than an ANTLR question. I 
will give some background on what I'm doing, which you can probably 
skip, because the question itself is at the end.

BACKGROUND:

    I am building an error detection tool for an academic project 
that detects errors by finding conflicting statements in the code. 
The target language will likely be Java, but I'd like to be able to 
extend the tool to work with other languages.

Example: 

initial statement: int x=0; implies that &quot;x is 0.&quot;
later statement: x=y/x; implies that &quot;x is not 0.&quot; (can't divide by 
zero)
contradiction: &quot;x is 0&quot; and &quot;x is not 0&quot;

(This is a simplification of Dawson Engler's approach to error 
detection.) 

I was planning on using ANTLR to create an abstract syntax tree which 
would be traversed to generate implications of each statement and 
then search for conflicts. The implications would need to be 
propogated based on execution path, the further the better.

THE QUESTION:

-How to determine execution path?

It would be ideal to not code this myself if the functionality is 
available in an open source tool. I would appreciate any information 
that can be provided, even if it is just pointing me in the right 
direction.

Many thanks,

Steve

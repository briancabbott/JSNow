<PRE>Why is it hypocritical?

If *I* drive recklessly, you are arguing that it's fair to blame the
occupants of the car I hit for the accident (equally with me, of course
:<i>-)
</I>
The *contributor* is placing the project at risk by virtue of his
contribution, therefore he has a duty to certify that he has behaved
properly in making that contribution. You cannot ask the USER to certify
that the CONTRIBUTOR has behaved himself. Therefore you (have to) place
a higher duty on the contributor.

Cheers,
Wol

&gt;<i> Now to your point.  What I suggest is not hypocritical, but you are

</I>
It's both asymmetric and hypocritical.  One of the big points about the
intent of the F/OSS world is the removal of hypocrisy.  I.e. the point
of
all of this is *more* than just the legal minimums.

[...]

&gt;<i> As a practical matter, regardless of any technically legal asymmetry
</I>in
&gt;<i> the license wording (and to a certainty if the risk is equally
</I>shared),
&gt;<i> the contributor, the project and the community will all likely loose
</I>&gt;<i> everything in defense of even a minimally credible legal challenge.
</I>
Yes, indeed, transaction costs in the current legal climate are utterly
ridiculous.

As to the &quot;likely to loose everything&quot;, that's still a very open
question.

Take care,
	John

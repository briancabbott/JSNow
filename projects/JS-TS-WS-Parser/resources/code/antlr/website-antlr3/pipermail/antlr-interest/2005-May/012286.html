&gt;<i> I'm off on holiday for 2 weeks on Thursday, and I think I'm rapidly

Is there some particular reason you need to switch to C++?

Basically, as Antlr v3 fleshes out, I'm going to be redoing the C grammar
in that.

&gt;<i> And, I mean this in the nicest possible way, but I've already tried 3
</I>&gt;<i> compilers (and failed to build a fourth, as well as failing to download a
</I>&gt;<i> fifth, and installed a new OS along the way), so I can't immediately see
</I>&gt;<i> that trying a sixth is going to bring anything to the party. If it works
</I>&gt;<i> with javac 1.4 then I'm not sure that we've actually learnt anything. I
</I>&gt;<i> just needed a sanity check to make sure that I wasn't being stupid.
</I>
Sure we (will) have.  Java v1.5 has a lot of little nasty corners where
things have change and GCJ is still a fair ways away from completeness.
Sun's JDK is the benchmark against which any such work should be checked
and the current stable, production quality is the latest Sun JDK v1.4.2_0x
release.

Take care,
	John

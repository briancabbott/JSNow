Hi Stefan. :)  Well, I'm of the camp that likes one way to do each  
thing.  Escaping a quote happens once or twice in for parsing a  
language like Java...not a big deal.  I did consider the issue of  
perhaps multi-line strings etc..., but you are breaking stuff up into  
bites on purpose with a parser...you don't get long token string  
definitions.

&gt;<i> This makes parsing harder, but everyone can choose what looks best,  
</I>&gt;<i> a source of error (using the wrong quotes) is eliminated, and the  
</I>&gt;<i> need to escape is reduced to the cases where you have both ' and &quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> inside the string.
</I>
I'm mainly concerned with the 100s of unit tests I have that are now  
unreadable.  i'm tempted to make it '...' just to get my unit tests  
back ;)

I was thinking on the way to my office today that perhaps if we use  
'...' for literals, then &quot;...&quot; could be used for a lexer grammar  
fragment like: &quot;'0'..'9'* ('X'|'L')&quot;, but then I decided that this is  
rarely what you want...unless you are trying to write a small amazing  
example for a journal paper article ;)

<PRE>Here's a problem I am having and can't figure out: I am trying to parse a hexadecimal string and zeroes

I build a very small example to highlight what the problem is.

Suppose an elemental log file for your check account. It just has credits and debits. Debits are identified by a prelude of '0001' and credits by '0002' Then comes the amount, up to $ 65535.


We make a modest start with a $100 credit and a $50 debit. So our log is '0001006400020030'

But the input window shows 0001064000103, some zeroes are missing - which of course is not what we want.

If we try with a $ 4369 deposit, the log is 0001111100020030.

Now the input window shows 0001111100010030. The credit is not altered, the debit is still losing zeroes.

My question is &#191;Why do the zeroes get this &quot;special treatment&quot;? &#191;How can I avoid it or work around it?


I would really appreciate either an explanation or some pointers to learn what is wrong here. I don't mind studying and learning, but need some help because I haven't been able to figure it out or to find an explanation.

Thank you very much in advance, your help will be greatly appreciated
&#193;lvaro.




P.S. I know this particular example can be easily solved using regular expressions. I just built this toy example to show how zeroes disappear from the input. I don't want to escape them with '\' symbols.

<PRE>Howdy folks,

My continued job as a professor, which gives me lots of time to do 
ANTLR stuff, rests ultimately on how well USF's new MS Internet 
Engineering program works out.  We have a very good response already to 
this program in terms of prospective students, but I would like to 
attract more students to the program to ensure it's success.

One of the best target markets is companies in the San Francisco Bay 
Area.  It would be great if any of you ANTLR folks out there could pass 
me the name of a contact at your company (perhaps a friend's company) 
in San Francisco to whom I could discuss attracting employees to the 
MSIE program.  Perhaps the contact is a programming manager, a quality 
assurance manager, training person, employee enrichment person, lowly 
hacker!?  Our MSIE courses generally start at like 5:30PM and we give 
20% discount on tuition to companies that send us more than 2 students. 
:<i>)

Sorry for the spam, even if related to supporting antlr ;)

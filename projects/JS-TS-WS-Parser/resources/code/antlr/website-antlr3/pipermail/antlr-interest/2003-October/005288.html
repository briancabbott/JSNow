<PRE>That's an unusual tree structure, it's like you have down and right mixed
up.  Think siblings and children.  All the catch blocks would be siblings,
right?  I would recommend something like:

idCatch--(right)--&gt; (another idCatch, etc.)
   |
(down)
   |
   v
Exception1--(right)--&gt;e1--(right)--&gt;block--(right)--&gt;null

The code:

statement :
   TRY^ block catchBlocks 
      (idFINALLY:FINALLY! finallyBlock:block!
	   {## = #(##,#(idFINALLY,#finallyBlock))} )?
   ;
 
catchBlocks :
	(catchBlock)+
	{##=#(#[CATCH_BLOCK],##);}
    ;

catchBlock:
   (CATCH^ LPAREN! identifier IDENTIFIER RPAREN! block
   )+
   ;

Also, try using toStringList() to print out your tree, you'll get a better
idea of the structure that way.

catchBlocks uses a standard tree building idiom to root a tree with an
imaginary node (which you'll define in your tokens{} section)

Note I split your catchBlock rule into two rules to be able to easily build
the tree I want to build.  I could have done the same with the &quot;finally&quot;
block part of &quot;statement&quot; too.

Subject: [antlr-interest] AST generation in a recursive rule

Hey all,
&#160;
I can't seem to get my mind around how to solve the following problem I am
having.&#160; I have rules to match a try-catch construct similar to that in
Java:
&#160;
statement! :
&#160;&#160; stateTry:TRY tryBlock:block idCATCH:catchBlock ( idFINALLY:FINALLY
finallyBlock:block )?
&#160;&#160;&#160;{ #statement = #(#stateTry, #tryBlock, #(#[CATCH], #idCATCH),
#(#idFINALLY, #finallyBlock)); } 
&#160;&#160;&#160;;
&#160;
catchBlock! :
&#160;&#160;&#160;( idCATCH:CATCH LPAREN! eType:identifier eID:IDENTIFIER RPAREN!
catchBody:block
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; { #catchBlock = #(#catchBlock, #idCATCH, #eType, #eID, #catchBody); }
&#160;&#160;&#160;)+
&#160;&#160; ;
These rules match input similar to the following:
&#160;
try {
}
catch(Exception1 e1) {
}
catch(Exception2 e2) {
}
catch(Exception3 e3) {
}
finally {
}
&#160;
I would like the resulting AST tree for the catchBlock rule&#160;to look like the
following:
&#160;
idCatch--(right)--&gt;Exception1--(right)--&gt;e1--(right)--&gt;block--(right)--&gt;null
&#160;&#160; |
(down)
&#160;&#160; |
&#160;&#160; v
idCatch--(right)--&gt;Exception2--(right)--&gt;e2--(right)--&gt;block--(right)--&gt;null
&#160;&#160; |
(down)
&#160;&#160; |
&#160;&#160; v
idCatch--(right)--&gt;Exception3--(right)--&gt;e3--(right)--&gt;block--(right)--&gt;null
&#160;&#160; |
(down)
&#160;&#160; |
&#160;&#160; v
&#160;null
&#160;
Everything parses without errors, but the resulting AST from the catchBlock
rule contains only the first and last catch AST's, the rest are somehow
discarded.&#160; What I suspect is happening is that instead of adding an
additional child, it overwrites it.&#160; What is the syntax to construct an AST
by appending consecutive subtrees to the resulting root AST for the
catchBlock rule?&#160; I am unable to find&#160;(or missed) any reference on how to do
this.
&#160;
Thanks,
&#160;
Jeff

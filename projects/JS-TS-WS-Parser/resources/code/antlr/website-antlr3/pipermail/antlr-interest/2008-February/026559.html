<PRE>Hello Jim,

 

I have an Antlr V2 C++ project that I would like to port. I'd be willing to
try porting it to Antlr V3 and C++ as a test.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Verifying bug reports in C runtime, beta
testers,unit tests

 

I am just about finished with the updates for the C runtime for the
impending ANTLR 3.1 release, but I need to verify a few things and look for
a little help. 

 

Firstly, a number of you sent me bug reports, which I believe I kept track
of correctly, but I think I missed putting some of them in Jira. Then my new
mail server trashed all my archives and an eagle swooped down from the sky
and stole my homework, and... The long and short of it is that in order that
I can make sure I really have covered all the reported bugs, if you have
reported a bug or asked for a feature from me since the last release, please
send me a repeat email with the bug and I will endeavor to ensure that the
bugs are fixed. Sorry for the extra work, but in future I will be putting
things straight into Jira as I get them rather than fooling myself that I
will have the time to verify the bugs first and so on. I am fine with
getting repeat reports and won't  b upset or offended, so just email me
anything you have in case I have missed it. Thanks in advance for that. 

 

 

Secondly, once the code is testable I would hope that some of you might wish
to try it out for m and tell me of any bugs that you find. I have not had a
lot of testing time for this release so if a few of us get together then the
testing will take no time at all. I don't need anyone to find the actual
reason for the bugs, just give me grammar snippets or code snippets and tell
me what goes wrong. Let m know if you have time to do that. 

 

Thirdly, the other targets have unit tests that can be run for regressions
and so on. Apart from hating producing unit test, I always think it is a
good idea for someone other than the developer to write such things. If
anyone feels like they are pedantic enough to write good unit tests for the
C runtime (I don't care how they are written etc, so long as it does not
involve installing 60 Java jars to do it ;-), then please let me know and I
will arrange some access to perforce for writing these with Ter. 

 

Finally, I intend that this release will allow the generated code to be
compiled as C++. This does not mean that the libraries will compile as C++,
they will still be an external C library, but it should mean that you can
use your own C++ classes in your grammar and they will compile just fine.
The output file will still be a .c, so it is up to you to switch on whatever
flags you need to compile it as C++. I would like to know if anyone is
willing to test this out as soon as I say go. There is nothing special to do
but try it out, but I would just like to know that one or two people HAVE
tried it out, rather than just hope they have. 

 

Finally finally, this release will come with a huge improvement in API and
usage documentation, which will be placed on the web site from the usual API
documentation links on the front page.  I am hoping that a few people might
run through it looking for errors or places where my
Yorkshire/Cockney/American grammar combination doesn't make sense. 

 

Thanks for you help, 

 

Jim

Maybe you should investigate the techniques used by the browsers. They 
bend over backward to accommodate the kinds of ill-formed input you 
have to deal with and generally do pretty well.

Also, I take it the authoring of these Wiki pages is an interactive 
process? Perhaps you'd be better off guiding users towards correct 
usage rather than trying to come up with useful interpretations to bad 
input?

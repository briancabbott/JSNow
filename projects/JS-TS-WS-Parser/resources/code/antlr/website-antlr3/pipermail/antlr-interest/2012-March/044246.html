<PRE>Hi Daniela.

Thanks for the response. I had tried what you suggested but no joy. 
However, it occurred to me that the problem might be that I am running 
Java 1.7. So changed AW's configuration to use Java 1.6, and it worked!

Again, thanks for your response.

Roger.

Hi

I usually have that problem in different circumstances (and in Windows):
1. When I launch the debug and for some reason didn't proceed the run 
until the end. It seems that the process for the debugger keeps alive and 
in the next run you get that error you mention. Solution: close 
antlrworks, make sure that all java processes related with it are killed 
and reopen antlrworks.

2. change the default port to a different one.

i hope that this help

Hi,

I just downloaded and installed ANTLRWorks version 1.4.3 with no problem.
I'm completly new to ANTLRWorks so I thought that I would start with the
expression evaluator tutorial [1]. So I downloaded the example grammar [2]
and opened it in AW (running on Ubuntu 10.10). I then proceeded to follow
the directions given in the tutorial; but when I tried to execute the
debugger, I received the following error message:

       Cannot launch the debuggerTab.
       Timeout waiting to connect to the remote parser.

I Google'd around look for others with similar problems and discovered a
few from 2009 and 2010. However, none of those had a resolution or work
around. I tried increasing the time out value as one of the posts
suggested, but that made no difference. I'm stumped at this point and have
no idea what to try next. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Roger Alexander.

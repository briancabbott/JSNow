</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are you doing anything to ensure that different (incompatable)
</I>&gt;<i> version
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of antlr can be used side-by-side in a project? I.e. Use different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; package names?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can't really do anything...the more common situation is to get an  
</I>&gt;<i> updated version and expect your code to still compile.   
</I>&gt;<i> antlr275.Token would be annoying, but is the only solution if you  
</I>&gt;<i> must have multiple version :(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Well... It's really only an issue when there is an incompatiblity.
If you know a new release is incompatible with an older one you 
can change the package name or deprecate the old class and put the
changes into a new class.

At this point I'm sure all your attention is on version 3 but going
forward it's a good thing to keep in mind that multiple versions of
antlr may have to run side-by-side in the same app.


&gt;<i> &gt; What about when Antlr 3.x come into widespread use? Will it be able
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be used in the same application with Antlr 2.x?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fortunately here we have org.antlr.* now instead of antlr.* so it  
</I>&gt;<i> works fine.  Indeed 3 is written in 2.7.5 :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is good to hear, you did use different package names.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An example I just encountered is Struts 1.2.7 comes with Antlr 2.7.2
</I>&gt;<i> and Hibernate 3.0.5 comes with antlr-2.7.5H3.jar.
</I>&gt;<i> In this project I'm not doing any development with antlr I'm just a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;user&quot; of Struts and Hibernate. And as a user I don't know if there
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> any dependencies on a particular version of antlr or even if these
</I>&gt;<i> two
</I>&gt;<i> are compatible.
</I>&gt;<i> If I use the later release 2.7.5H3 will it break something is Struts?
</I>
So does anyone know if there are any gotchas when upgrading from Antlr
2.7.2  to 2.7.5H3 (or the latest 2.7.x) release?

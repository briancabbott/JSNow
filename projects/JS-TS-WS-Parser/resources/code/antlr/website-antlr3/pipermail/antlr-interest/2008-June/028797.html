<PRE>Dear Benjamin,

2008/6/24 Benjamin Niemann &lt;<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">pink at odahoda.de</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> EOF is the only predefined token here. There are a few others, but
</I>&gt;<i> they only appear when working with tree parsers.
</I>&gt;<i> They all have in common that they do not match any of the input characters.
</I>

Thank you; however, \n is not defined in my grammar, so presumably it is
defined in Antlr somewhere.


&gt;<i> Since you are using Python, an easy way to see which tokens your lexer
</I>&gt;<i> match is to use
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> python DCPLexer.py &lt;input.txt
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> python DCPLexer.py
</I>&gt;<i> [enter input, then hit CTLR-D]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  (under UNIX, Windows might be slightly differently) and it will just
</I>&gt;<i> dump a list of matched tokens.
</I>

I'm running this under Windows. I'm afraid I didn't get any output from
either of those commands.


&gt;<i> The only special thing about \n is that it is always used to track the
</I>&gt;<i> line/column information which is attached to the tokens. But there's
</I>&gt;<i> no magic or special handing when it comes to matching tokens.
</I>

It would be good to know more about this. I haven't found anything very
helpful on the Antlr site or wiki yet.

And regarding the exhaustive guide: As far as I can tell the wiki
&gt;<i> should contain everything in a 'reference guide' style, i.e. all
</I>&gt;<i> information regarding syntax, symbols etc. is in there. But for a
</I>&gt;<i> deeper guide to the semantics, you should probably have a look at the
</I>&gt;<i> book.
</I>

Thanks for the suggestions; I've already consulted both. I will continue
looking, but since searches (I have the book in PDF) haven't turned up
anything much, I think I've probably covered the existing bases. This kind
of surprises me, because it means everyone using Antlr either just &quot;gets&quot;
the syntax (I don't; though I &quot;get&quot; some of it), or they are essentially
reverse-engineering undocumented parts of the syntax and learning as they go
(which is a lot more effort than just consulting a spec sheet; I would have
thought Terence Parr was against this sort of effort).

I'd be grateful for further suggestions if you have any. Many thanks,

Sam

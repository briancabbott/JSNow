</I>&gt;<i> If so, could you add it into a &quot;Developer's&quot; section of the ANTLR V3

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Gang, thanks very much for all the helpful and insightful suggestions. I also talked it over in person with a few people yesterday. Sounds like the simplest thing to do is to create a single contributors file in the repository that contains the contributors license. Anyone that wants to be a contributor, can simply fork, add their name, commit, send a pull request and then they are in the system. Any future pull requests can be merged with a quick check on their name. The contributors file can also be augmented with their signoff him during the first pull request.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This would be on a per project basis.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On a related problem with pull requests. As Sam Harwell pointed out to me, github has a pretty serious problem when it comes to forked repositories.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We've started fully qualifying everything in our normal commits, but the pull requests are still being merged with the syntax &quot;Merge pull request #23 from parrt/master&quot;, which will then propagate to and mess up the issues of everyone who merges antlr/antlr4 into their forks.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This I guess is only a problem if you are creating your own issues in your own fork of antlr, right? Can anyone comment on this problem?

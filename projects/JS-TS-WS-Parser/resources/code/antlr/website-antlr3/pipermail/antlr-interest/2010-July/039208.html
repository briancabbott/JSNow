</I>Hi Cid,

I had to deal with a similar situation, and neither of the solutions 
suggested in the wiki worked for me 
(<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1741">http://www.antlr.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1741</A>), and I 
haven't seen any other solutions described in the email. After a lot of 
experimentation I came up with a hybrid solution.

One approach described is to define identifier like this:

identifier : KEY1 | KEY2 | ... | ID ;

The reason that this doesn't work is that where you have a production 
that says &quot;( KEY1 | identifier ) &quot;Antlr reports a conflict and disables 
the second alternative unless it can resolve the conflict with its 
extended lookahead. So depending on which order you put them either KEY1 
or identifier gets disabled, neither of which gives you a working 
parser. The only way you would be able to make this work would be to 
define a different identifier production for every different situation, 
with the conflicting keywords removed. That might work for a handful of 
different keywords, but doesn't scale.

The other suggested solution is to create productions like this:

keyIF : {input.LT(1).getText().equals(&quot;if&quot;)}? ID ;
keyCALL : {input.LT(1).getText().equals(&quot;call&quot;)}? ID ;

This is even worse than the other solution. I don't think there is any 
way to make this work at all. The problem is that the semantic predicate 
doesn't get applied when doing looking ahead in other productions, only 
when actually trying to make the keyXXX productions. So everywhere you 
have &quot;( key1 | identifier )&quot;, to Antlr this looks like &quot;( ID | ID )&quot;. 
This completely throws the lookahead for a loop. In many cases it will 
actually generate a parser without warnings, but the actual lookahead 
it's doing is just wrong. For example, I had a case something like 
&quot;(keyA keyB LEFT_BRACKET) | (keyC keyD keyE)&quot;. To Antler's lookahead 
analysis this said &quot;(ID ID LEFT_BRACKET)|(ID ID ID)&quot;, so it generated 
lookahead that basically said &quot;if (LT(3) == LEFT_BRACKET) option1 else 
option2&quot;. So it was taking other things like &quot;C D (&quot; and trying to parse 
them as &quot;A B (&quot;, then of course throwing run time exceptions on the 
failed semantic predicates.

The hybrid approach I came up with was to define the keywords as 
separate token types and define an identifier rule like in the first 
approach, but then also create keyword productions similar to the second 
approach:

keyIF: {input.LT(1).getText().equals(&quot;if&quot;)}? IF ;

I know at first glance the semantic predicate seems pointless. But it 
causes Antlr to ignore the conflicts that it would have reported 
otherwise, resulting in a working grammar.

There are just two caveats with this approach. First, it can also 
suppress reporting of real conflicts, causing bugs in your parser. To 
avoid this it's a good idea to first develop and test the grammar 
without the semantic predicates in the keyword rules and without the 
keywords as alternatives in the identifier rule. Once you have the 
grammar working this way with no conflicts, then it's safe to put the 
other rules that handle the non-reserved keywords.

Second, all those semantic predicates can cause the size of the 
generated parser to blow up. It can cause syntactic predicates to have a 
lot of special states and make the DFAs huge. This may only be a problem 
with the Java runtime, where the JVM imposes extreme size limits on 
class size (64KB). With large grammars or complex lookahead situations 
it can result in an uncompilable Java class being generated.

Hope this helps,

Ron

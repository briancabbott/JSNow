&gt;<i> There's a big difference 
</I>&gt;<i> indeed between expanding a macro and evaluation an expression.  If you 
</I>&gt;<i> splice a rule (expand a macro), you first construct the text by merging 
</I>&gt;<i> (a purely syntactic operation, no matching/eval/etc.), and the result is 
</I>&gt;<i> another piece of grammar to be matched.  But if you delegate, you first 
</I>&gt;<i> do the matches (in a new local scope), then tokenize the result (bind it 
</I>&gt;<i> to a single token) which is inserted.  So the components are *not* 
</I>&gt;<i> inserted into the syntax.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In a word, you end up with different token structures depending on 
</I>&gt;<i> whether you splice or delegate.  At least that's the idea.
</I>
Just an example:
FOO: &quot;abc&quot; BAR;
BAR: &quot;def&quot;;

vs.

FOO: &quot;abc&quot; BAR;
protected BAR: &quot;def&quot;;

vs.

FOO: &quot;abc&quot; &quot;def&quot;;
(protected) BAR: &quot;def&quot;;

All of these will currently result in a single FOO token containing
&quot;abcdef&quot; on input &quot;abcdef&quot;. There is no observable difference to the
user, except for non-determinism problems if something else than BAR can
match &quot;def&quot;.

&gt;<i> But if you delegate, you first 
</I>&gt;<i> do the matches (in a new local scope), then tokenize the result (bind it 
</I>&gt;<i> to a single token) which is inserted.  So the components are *not* 
</I>&gt;<i> inserted into the syntax.
</I>
As far as I know if you &quot;delegate&quot;, e.g. do not have a protected rule,
it does not return a Token instead of a String or something - there is
also no (Java) implementation difference, but that should not matter to
the user anyways.

I'm not sure what you're referring to with local scope, but if mean that
a &quot;spliced&quot; rule should be able to access stuff from the scope of the
&quot;calling&quot; rule, then this is -sorry- pure madness. Macros are evil! A
single &quot;,&quot; operator that changes the semantic meanings of the access to
scopes is just completely confusing and does not have any reasonable
use. You actually have (protected/internal/sub)rules so you can separate
your code, not so you can mix it all together and have scope accesses
from the other end of the source file.

&gt;<i> &gt; I'd propose to call those rules &quot;internal&quot; - as stated, they cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directly accessed from outside of the Lexer (in the rule matching
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; meaning) and &quot;internal&quot; also expresses the Java protected behaviour.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Internal/external, hidden/exposed, etc. - that's all distinct from the 
</I>&gt;<i> core issue of splicing v. tokenizing, no?
</I>
Well, I'm arguing that there is no splicing issue, just an
internal/external issue.

&gt;<i>   Which might be construed more 
</I>&gt;<i> usefully as syntactic v. semantic splicing.  I suppose one might argue 
</I>&gt;<i> that the internal/external distinction is itself an irrelevant 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation detail - what counts is tokenizing.
</I>
Internal vs. External has a huge impact, e.g.
FOO: &quot;abc&quot; BAR;
BAR: &quot;def&quot;;
BAZ: &quot;def&quot;;
does not work, as BAR and BAZ are identical. Add &quot;protected&quot; or
&quot;internal&quot; or whatever to BAR, and it will work. The example is a bit
contrived, but you get the idea.

Regards,
Martin

PS: can you use another word for what you call &quot;tokenize&quot;? I think it's
reserved for the process of splitting an input up into several Tokens,
e.g. what the Lexer does.

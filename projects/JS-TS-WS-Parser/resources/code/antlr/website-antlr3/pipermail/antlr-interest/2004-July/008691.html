There's a number of ways to go about this and it kindoff depends on what
you'd exactly want.

1. You can use different lexers for the normal lines and the comment lines.
Check out the multiLexer examples from the distribution.

2. In some cases you might be able to us the filter option from the lexer.
(probably not in your case) (this does not work for parsers)

3. In another case you might look at the hidden token approach to 'hide'
the comment parts. Check out the preserveWhitespace example.

4. The tokenStreamRewrite stuff could also apply in some cases. Check out
the tokenStreamRewrite examples. (C++ version is available only in
development version (unreleased yet))

Could well be that you need a combination of 1 and 3.

&gt;<i> Is there any way to tell ANTLR to call a special method in my code for
</I>&gt;<i> anything which does not match any of the given parse rules?
</I>
Not really. Or you have to meddle a lot with the error handling mechanisms
(probably a lot of headache while the options above might be better suited).

Cheers,

Ric

<PRE>
&gt;<i> and Jean Bovet has created a 1.0ea1 release of his excellent 
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLRWorks:
</I>
&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/works/index.html">http://www.antlr.org/works/index.html</A>
</I>
&gt;<i> The ANTLRWorks jar has everything you need including ANTLR 3.0ea1.
</I>
ANTLRWorks early comments:

1. Build &amp; Debug should provide a sensible default for the location of
working/generated files.  I suggest a &quot;debug&quot; sub-dir below the location of
the grammar file. The tool should indicate if the dir needs to be created.

2. From the Build &amp; Debug dialog, clicking browse to change the current
setting doesn't start browsing from the current setting's location, it
always starts at the user's &quot;home directory&quot; (the &quot;My Documents&quot; dir on my
Windows box).

3. As per my previous message, I get a lot of entries in the console about
it's inability to write to a grammar.stats file. The dir/folder does exist
but the file doesn't.

&lt;error&gt;
[14:41:29] internal error: Exception
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException at sun.nio.ch.FileLockImpl.release</A>(Unk
nown Source): can't write stats to C:\Documents and
Settings\MichealJ\antlrworks\grammar.stats 
&lt;/error&gt;

4. Can this support cross-language debugging?. Is there some TCP protocol
that needs to be supported by geberated parsers/lexers to support this
scenario?.

5. The syntax diagram is a useful addition. I was expecting to be able to
navigate and perhaps refactor visually. Perhaps in time... ;-)

6. Perhaps the tool should keep track of generated status internally and
disable the items on the &quot;Generate&quot; menu accordingly. Got tired of being
told I couldn't show code until something had being generated.

On a different note, the java.g grammar in the examples archive doesn't have
a &quot;comilationUnit&quot; start rule equivalent.

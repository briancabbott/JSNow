<PRE>Hi!

The package I told you about is a part of a project that me and a friend
have done some time ago. It is a relational DBMS called Tomato
(<A HREF="http://tomato4j.hypermart.net/">http://tomato4j.hypermart.net/</A>). It is written in Java and includes(besides
other tools) a (hand built) compiler for a custom language. It generates
.class files. The class file generator package is a small one but it offers
sufficient functionality.

Currently, the project currently is at version 1 (beta) and it is freeware.
The good news is that we intend to release version 2 as open source - with
the compiler rewritten using ANTLR and the database engine extended with a
JDBC driver.

The release date of version 2 is unclear right now. I know ArgoUML and it is
a remarcable effort. This is why I'm going to send you (in a separate mail)
the sources of the classfile reader/writer package. It might not be the best
thing around, but it could be enough.

Robert

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; First of all, I don't know about the existence of such a (n ANTLR)

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I know pretty much the java .class file format. As it is straighforward,
</I>I
&gt;<i> &gt; have built a package that reads and writes this file format.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Based on that experience, I think the main problem of building such a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grammar would be to apply a certain rule a specific number of times (for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instance you read the number of methods the class file holds and based
</I>on
&gt;<i> &gt; this number, you iterate to read every method). This is the main
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; characteristic of the .class format (as well as of many binary file
</I>format).
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know. I already thought about that problem and I guess it could be
</I>solved
&gt;<i> within the production of such a rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I know that predicates are one of the features ANTLR has. I think this
</I>could
&gt;<i> &gt; be the only salvation... However, if you manage to find an existing
</I>grammar,
&gt;<i> &gt; please let me know.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Robert
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PS.: You may find the exact description of the .class format in the Java
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Virtual Machine Specification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I studied the JVM specs before I wrote my posting. That's when I thought
</I>that
&gt;<i> doing the parsing with Antlr should be easier than writing the parser
</I>myself.

It's ANTLR itself that produces it, and it's not quite true that 
nothing relies on it.  If you have a separated lexer and parser 
then the .tokens file is an output of the lexer and an input of 
the parser (via the tokenVocab option), since both lexer and 
parser need to agree on a common set of tokens.  (I think it's 
used internally in a similar fashion even when building a combined 
lexer/parser.)

I believe it can also be an output of the parser and input for a 
tree parser, since the parser can introduce new imaginary tokens 
for use in the AST.  But I've never actually used a tree parser 
myself, so I'm not completely sure about that :)

</I>
Well, there *is* licensing involved in contributing to ANTLR; I'm 
simplifying but basically you have to agree that the code you've 
written can be freely distributed and modified by other people.

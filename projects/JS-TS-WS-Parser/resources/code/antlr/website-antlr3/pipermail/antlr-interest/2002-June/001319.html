I don't know much about C++ (&lt;RETURN-RANT&gt; more precisely, I don't want to
remember &lt;/RETURN-RANT&gt;), so I speak only for Java environments. My Ant task
is looking at the imported token files and at the generated files, and only
if dates are wrong, it invokes ANTLR again. So it avoids all unnecessary
recompilation, except for cases when you add a whitespace in the grammar. It
also save time by not invoking ANTLR at all, when it's not necessary.

By the way, you can do the same in PreservingFileWriter; you have all
information required about supergrammars, imported files and generated files
collected during grammar analysis by ANTLR.

</I>
Just incidentally, the next incarnation of Ant (Ant 2) will be independent
of XML or other particular encoding, which I think it's a step in the right
direction.

</I>&gt;<i> this probably will go into the 0.001% (okay I may be exagerating here..

</I>
You are probably right about times, it's more a psychological factor (&lt;RANT&gt;
against improvements that make things slower &lt;/RANT&gt;). And it's my inability
to get grammars right from the first time that makes me ANTLR them several
times before having something to compile ;-) Or maybe it's because those
damned temporary files were making the Ant unit tests to fail from time to
time, and it took us two days to figure what's happening :-))

Anyway, I can live with it as default behavior.

Cheers,
Bogdan

&gt;<i> Another option is extending the interface of Tool.java to select a

</I>&gt;<i> method. But I'm not 100% sure how this interacts with antlr's preprocessor

</I>&gt;<i> and probably we should move the openOutputFile stuff to the codegenerators
</I>&gt;<i> where they can select the preferred PrintWriter, then have Tool.openoutput

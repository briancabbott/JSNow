that is true; unfortunately I'm not really qualified to write that  
book ;)  Well, not if we're talking about programming languages too.

&gt;<i> It's awkward. Language Design Patterns is a little snappier than  
</I>&gt;<i> Design Patterns for Language Implementation, I'll admit,
</I>
yup. snappy is good :)

&gt;<i> and replacing language with more implementations-specific words like  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;parser&quot; is bad as it changes the emphasis to sound like it's about  
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR &quot;under the hood&quot;. Of course, there's always that word - ANTLR.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seriously, ANTLR Design Patterns, and then a subtitle much as you've  
</I>&gt;<i> already mentioned.
</I>
yeah, trying to make it as general as possible.

&gt;<i> Sure, people won't be as likely to pick it up if they're not aware  
</I>&gt;<i> of ANTLR, but not many who pick it up will fail to put it down if  
</I>&gt;<i> they don't know of ANTLR anyway, unless you sell it differently. The  
</I>&gt;<i> only sort of book that sold ANTLR to non-ANTLR-aware-people would be  
</I>&gt;<i> a real newbie-level type thing introducing all of the concepts in  
</I>&gt;<i> tutorial fashion (like the difference between O'Reilly 'Learning ~'  
</I>&gt;<i> books and '~ in a Nutshell' books - ANTLR Reference is like a  
</I>&gt;<i> Nutshell). Of course, now I'm selling a concept for a third book...
</I>
I'm not sure about this. There is a giant hole in the market sitting  
between the Dragon book and a number of language implementation books  
that use scheme instead of a language programmers use everyday.   
people can use this without ANTLR no problem. As I point out in the  
book, when you were learning to fly there's no choice but to pick an  
airplane. Later you can transfer your skills easily to another aircraft.

&gt;<i> So I think ANTLR Design Patterns - Techniques and Strategies for  
</I>&gt;<i> Language Implementation. Add &quot;Domain Specific&quot; before &quot;Language&quot; if  
</I>&gt;<i> the publishers are so keen on the buzzwords. Where do you draw the  
</I>&gt;<i> line on a DSL anyway?
</I>
a tough question. yeah, making titles is really really hard.

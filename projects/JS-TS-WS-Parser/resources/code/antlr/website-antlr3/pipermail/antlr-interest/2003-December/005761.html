I don't see this option (looked twice).  I see only moderate 
subscription and I believe moderate each post, neither of which are 
what we want really.  I'm not sure we can have more than one moderator 
for postings...w/o that people around the world would have to wait for 
me all the time, which is not a good solution just because you get spam 
here like you do in regular email ('course I don't since I use

Can you give me a link to this feature?  It's still a bad deal because 
new people cannot ask a question and get an immediate answer.  Might 
have to wait up to a week when I go on vacation or off for the weekend.

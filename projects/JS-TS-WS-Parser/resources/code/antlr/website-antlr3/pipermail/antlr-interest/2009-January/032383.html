Hmmm, if the code gen is smart enough to break up

gDecl .setName($k.start.getStartIndex());

to produce this

gDecl .setName((k != null ? ((CommonToken) k.start ) : null 
).getStartIndex());

then it should be able to produce this instead

gDecl .setName((k != null ? ((CommonToken) k.start.getStartIndex()) : null ));

Yes, &quot;start&quot; could be null, but at least with this production, the 
code gen is leaving me no more worse off than I was to begin 
with.  The null check will continue to protect in the case of 
optional label references - a really different requirement than a 
null check on &quot;start&quot;.  The current production unfortunately kills 
the whole 'protect the optional label reference' point of the code 
generated null check.

I did see Ter's note that the current code gen analysis is not 
looking far enough ahead to handle this.  But, that is just one of 
those minor, no-doubt short-lived practical inconveniences. ;-)

I have to say that I am doing this less and less and, always now, the 
issues are these kind of odd code generation issues.  The evolution 
of Antlr as a language has been amazing to watch.  Still, I look 
forward to when lifting the cover will not be required except in the 
most exceptional of circumstances.

Best,
Gerald

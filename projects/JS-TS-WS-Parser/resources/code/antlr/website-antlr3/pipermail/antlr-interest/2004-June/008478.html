<PRE>I'm a complete noob and I'm trying to get a handle on ANTLR. The docs 
are great, but a bit overwhelming and I'm looking for a place to start 
to find out how to do the following.

I've read through the HTML.g C# example that comes with the tarball and 
found that it is very similar to what I need. Basically, I need to 
examine an HTML file, break it down into a logical tree that I can 
manipulate, adding, deleting, and altering content on the fly. If I have 
&lt;div class=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Stuff here&lt;/div&gt; I would want to replace &quot;Stuff here&quot; 
with something else depending upon the name given to &quot;class&quot;. This 
requires that I get at the values of ATTR in HTML.g at the parser level, 
if I am correct. This also requires building a tree that contains all 
these nodes. I have looked at the tree docs and can't understand them, 
so I don't even know if I'm heading in the wrong direction or not. I 
basically understand the syntax of a grammar, but much of it eludes me 
as of yet.

Oh, I've never worked with any tools of this sort before. I mean it when 
I say complete noob. ;)

Thanks!

There is no answer to give. I asked no question.

I have long been and continue to be both.


&gt;<i> So i leave the question open for those who are intersted to talk
</I>&gt;<i> about :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> did anyone worked on pseudocode--&gt;java translation?
</I>
The question continues to be meaningless.

Give a grammar for your pseudocode (virtually certain to be 
idiosyncratic) and you can get an answer (virtually certain to 
be &quot;no&quot;).

Pseudocode is, per se, not a thing. It cannot be &quot;implemented.&quot; It 
cannot be &quot;translated.&quot;

And once you pin down the grammar... well, then, it's no 
longer &quot;pseudo,&quot; is it?


I am only trying to get you to think about your question. Otherwise you 
will founder endlessly.

Perhaps you could start by giving some examples? They will elicit 
specific questions about (gasp!) the grammar they exemplify. As you 
answer them and as that process continues, you'll end up with a 
particular grammar. _That_ can be implemented. But I assure you that no 
one has done so before&#8212;it will be a novel language.

So it goes.

So you might as well skip the vacuous questions and start conceiving the 
grammar of the &quot;pseudo-&quot; code you wish to implement. When you do, it 
will no longer be pseudo, but it will (potentially) be implementable.

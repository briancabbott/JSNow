Weird numbers. Not what I'd expect, then again it's java =)

I would like to look at this before it might go into C++ mode. My
experience with these kind of guards is that in a non critical loop the
overhead is usually neglectible. Object creation can be very costly in C++.

Also it would depend very much on the grammar and the amount of guessing
occuring. Does this work in the general case?

It also depends on coding style in antlr. If you spread around a lot of
actions which could be bundled in one action block, you'll end up with a
lot of 'guards'.

&gt;<i> So, how do you vote? 
</I>
In java mode I'd vote blank (leaving it to the experts), In C++ mode I'd
say no for now untill I do some experimenting.

Cheers,

Ric

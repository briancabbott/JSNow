With backtrack=true, I don't get the warnings, but the grammar also
doesn't behave quite correctly. Not sure why, but in a standard test
input, one of the rules fails. Probably fixable. I guess I've been
avoiding backtracking until now to really understand what it does...it
may be a good solution for readability though.

Can you explain why the warnings don't appear with backtrack=true?

I can't really test the snapshot (immediately) because it treats
certain warnings as errors. Eg, &quot;The following alternatives are
unreachable: 1&quot;. In ANTLRworks that's a warning, with the snapshot
it's an error. Actually it also seems to generate the original warning
(Could not analyze...) but then ramps it up to a warning (internal
error...could not even do k=1 for decision 20).

Were these deliberate choices? What was the reasoning?

Aside: the &quot;following alternatives are unreachable&quot; warning/error it
gives points to the middle character of the sequence &quot;.)*&quot; in my
HTML_COMMENT rule:

HTML_COMMENT:
    (('&lt;!--') =&gt; '&lt;!--' (options {greedy=false;}: .)* ('--&gt;' | EOF) {
$channel=HIDDEN; })
    | '&lt;' { $type=LT; };

Why is that unreachable?

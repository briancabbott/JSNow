Current CommonToken makes a new String object from a buffer, which  
must make a copy as that buffer is overwritten next token (needs new  
char array).  it does not point into the buffer with indexes as does v3.

&gt;<i> Lexer
</I>&gt;<i> makes strings from chars it gets from input stream. So
</I>&gt;<i> for every identifier in stream you get entirely
</I>&gt;<i> different string objects with separate char arrays.
</I>
Yes.  New one will point into one buffer; no separate char arrays.

&gt;<i> Of
</I>&gt;<i> course, they won't be duplicated more than they occur
</I>&gt;<i> in input stream... and there is no sharing at all and
</I>&gt;<i> won't be with that approach in v3.0
</I>
hooray!

</I>&gt;<i> Um... The certification for mine will happen on an

</I>
Yes, it can handle the continuous (but not by default) and 37MB is  
teeny still really.  I have 2G on my box. ;)

&gt;<i> The current suggestion comes from my observation of
</I>&gt;<i> processing an 8MB automatically generated sadist
</I>&gt;<i> pathological example made by me for which the parse
</I>&gt;<i> tree contains total of 5.7M nodes... 40% are

</I>&gt;<i> saved me 150MB of memory  :)
</I>
Nice!  Some folks have suggested making the Token object also the  
tree node, which will further factor things out.  ANTLR v3 can do  
this no sweat as I assume absolutely nothing about the type of a tree  
node.  You pass me an &quot;adaptor&quot; that tells me how to add children and  
navigate :)

&gt;<i> Uh, I dunno how to put it, but somehow Terence, you
</I>&gt;<i> seem to underestimate the reach, potential and
</I>&gt;<i> influence of all the kickass tools you've made. I did
</I>
Wow!  Hooray!  Thanks...the next version is gonna kick so much ass it  
will reach around and kick my own ass ;)  Ha hah hahah!  I'm hoping  
to have it &quot;ready for student abuse&quot; in January.

&gt;<i> a lot of research and will have a solid testimony once
</I>&gt;<i> I complete this thing... one being making difference

</I>
That's awesome...can't wait to hear the results (good or bad).

&gt;&gt;<i> remember when my 16k
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> machine was great! ;)  Anybody remember which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> processor was 1.077 mhz
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> God I'm young... my first was a 640k, 16 something MHz
</I>&gt;<i> on which I learnt BASIC and MSDOS 3.3 &amp; 5.0 more than
</I>&gt;<i> a decade back :)
</I>
That's pretty good.  Some folks &quot;became conscious&quot; on 128M machines. ;)

BTW, the 1.077mhz machine was the 6502 in the apple II. :)

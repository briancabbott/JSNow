<PRE>I see what you mean. Lately a friend of mine asked me how ANTLR 
decides which token rule to use for a production. This made me talk 
for half an hour but I could not really get it explained. He was 
thinking of something like &quot;the most specific rule will be the one 
to match&quot; and I was trying to say &quot;no, it is all very 
deterministic&quot;. Anyway, &quot;most specific&quot; is similar to what you made 
up using left factoring or how you called it &quot;combine left 
edges&quot;. &quot;Most specific&quot; seems to be the most natural way to 
interpret token definitions. One thing to notice there is

DIGIT1 : '1';

is also more specific than 

INT : ('0'..'9')+ ;

which can not be handeled with left factoring as it seems to me. For 
certain rule based systems it is instead very possible to make this 
distinction. How do they do this?!

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> INT_FLOAT
</I>&gt;<i> 	:	('0'..'9')+ ('.' ('0'..'9')*)?
</I>&gt;<i> 	|	'.' ('0'..'9')+
</I>&gt;<i> 	;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> or whatever.

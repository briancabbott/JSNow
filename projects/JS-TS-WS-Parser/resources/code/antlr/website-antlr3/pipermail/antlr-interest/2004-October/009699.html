True. But for some cases they're the only solution.
For one project I was taking up, the tool was supposed
to be able to run on 3 different platforms as varied
as *nix-gcc to windows-msvc and solaris-suncc.
Supporting all three on C/C++ was nightmare. My
solution was to pick up eclipse and program away in
Java and care *less* about the zillion compiler
compatibilities, GUI issues and segfaults.(too bad I
chose JavaCC at that time.. ANTLR would have made a
HELL LOT of difference)

Last I read that was from some posting from '80s where
assembly programmers were complaining about slooowness
of C. How about writing a lexer+parser tool in
assembly ?? &lt;:-)

Remember, you can buy two FAST computers for the price
of a decent programmer's one month salary!!

I like this quote from a LISP hackers' site : 
&quot;I refuse to do things that computers can do&quot;.

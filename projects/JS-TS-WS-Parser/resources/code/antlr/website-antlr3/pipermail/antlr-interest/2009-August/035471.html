Don't forget that 'whitespace' is arbitrary - you could consider spaces 
to be whietspace, but not, say, tabs or newlines. I believe there are 
languages where this is the case - spaces are never significant, but 
some other types of whitespace are.

I'm curious as to why you want to sometimes consider whitespace, though. 
Is this a self-designed language, or a specification you're working from 
that makes whitespace 'sometimes' significant?

You example was a function call or declaration. You can always get help 
from the lexer here if there are situations where there *must* be a 
space, and situations where there *mustn't* be a space, and nothing 
else... have tokens that include the lparen.

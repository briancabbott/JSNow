</I>&gt;<i> It is convenient for the parser to throw an exception at the first problem
</I>&gt;<i> since NUnit will catch unhandled exceptions and display their tracebacks,
</I>&gt;<i> etc. The ANTLR book talks about how to do this. As I understand it I have
</I>&gt;<i> to provide my own mismatch() and recoverFromMismatchedSet() methods. I
</I>&gt;<i> also have to provide a @rulecatch block that catches RecognitionException
</I>&gt;<i> and rethrows it. The book shows this in Java, but the C# version is
</I>&gt;<i> basically the same (I replaced IntStream with IIntStream).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It almost seems to work. However while playing with my test cases I
</I>&gt;<i> noticed that under certain circumstances no exception is thrown and the
</I>&gt;<i> parser returns normally... even though an error message is written to
</I>&gt;<i> standard error. In the case in question I have an extra ';' where 'END' is
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to be. I get the following message on standard error:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> extraneous input ';' expecting END
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The message is quite reasonable. The problem is that NUnit thinks the test
</I>&gt;<i> succeeded. NUnit's GUI console does display the error message on the
</I>&gt;<i> 'Console Error' tab but the test still shows green. This is a problem for
</I>&gt;<i> me because when I run my tests I want to be able to just look at the green
</I>&gt;<i> lights and be happy. If I also have to investigate other tabs I will
</I>&gt;<i> likely forget and I might overlook a problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So my question is simply: is there a way to get even this kind of error to
</I>&gt;<i> thrown an exception as well? I could also solve my problem if there was
</I>&gt;<i> some way to learn from the result returned by the parser if the parse was
</I>&gt;<i> completely successful or not. Did ANTLR execute any kind of recovery? If I
</I>&gt;<i> could check for that I could fail the test and be happy as well.
</I>&gt;<i>

This seems to be a bug in ANTLR as such behavior doesn't fit my
expectations, too. But it seems to be more likely that this is a general
target bug and not specific to the C# target. Without the grammar in
question neither Ter nor me can be sure. Can you send it on- or off-list
to both of us? Does your grammar depend on C#-code to work correctly or
can it easily converted to Java to cross-check the cause?

<PRE>Hi,
 
The need to manage this sort of release reminds me that the project would
benefit from a Continuous Integration build environment. For one thing it
would encourage us (and others) to add more unit tests. For another, daily
(or even more frequent) builds of the depot HEAD would be available with a
report about tests passed/failed/ignored etc.
 
One option might be Cruise Control (since the existing server(s) can run
Java) and CruiseControl is a CI system built in Java. It can be massaged to
work with Nant (for C#) and CPP (Cpp links below):

Subject: [antlr-interest] New C runtime dist



There is a new distribution snapshot checked in which is labeled 3.0.1. This
may change if Ter decides that the first bug fix release will be called
something completely different.

 

To use this, you also need to rebuild ANTLR or at least make it pick up the
latest C.stg.

 

This fixes:

 

-          All bugs that you lot know about ;-) - Mistyped MACRO names,
followSet problem, and all those problems that people moaned at me for
making them waste two hours on there are actually quite a number of trivial
little fixes in there too;

-          Provides stacked streams so that they may be handled trivially in
lexers etc (see example of the C parser in the C examples, which now caters
for #include.)

-          Corrects a couple of tree stream rewrite issues (one is code gen,
one was in the runtime);

 

I have not been able to extensively test this and remember this is snapshot
to see if bugs are fixed properly. If you had a bug and know how to rebuild
things then please try this out and let me know if you still have issues.
Please try to be polite - most people are J. I am well aware of all the
typos in my comments - I type at 2342342 characters a second and 98% are BS
J and I will fix all those up at some point so no need to send me things
like that.

 

Share and Enjoy,

 

Jim

<PRE>Hi,

Sounds very good. This probably also means that the current action.g
xxxCodeGenerator interface was thoroughly revised? (this would completely
overjoy me ;) )

The changes need porting to C++ still I presume?

This means we are going to jump from 2.7.2a1 to 2.8 ?

Cool.

Sounds good all the extensions/changes. I'm still a bit in the unclear as
to the exact syntax (maybe a few examples..) but I trust it will be a huge
improvement.

Well done!

Is there already a branch available in the repository with these changes?

Cheers,

Ric

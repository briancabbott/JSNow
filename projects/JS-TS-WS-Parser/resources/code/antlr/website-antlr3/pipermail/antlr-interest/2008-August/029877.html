There's a few &quot;placeholders&quot; like that around at the moment -- 
stuff that's (presumably) intended to be implemented sometime 
later on.

Another one is the public/protected/private against a 
rule.  Doesn't do anything at present, but it's accepted.  (And it 
sometimes trips people up when porting from v2, since 'protected' 
meant something different there.)

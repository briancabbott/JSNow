<PRE>Hi everyone!

Sorry for not answering before, but I have been studying your answers and 
making a trade-off list about them. At the end, I am going to use the 
netbeans plugging for integrating ANTLR, although I wanted a stand-alone 
application as I already had the SWING custom interface (IDE like) running 
via Eclipse, so I only needed to call in background the process of ANTLR 
validation and show the results of the validation in the console window. 
But I don't think it is going to be complicated to import it into eclipse 
as I used custom libraries.

After I finish with the prototype I will let you know, 'cos my final goal 
is to create the desktop application without requiring Netbeans, Eclipse 
to be installed in the computer just JAVA, so it also can be embedded into 
other projects.

Hi,

so this is really interesting. Do you know if the text editing components 
are available standalone from NetBeans - I heard such a thing?

BR,
Paul

Hi there,

Another option you have is to use the NetBeans platform for these
editor tasks. Basically, you keep a list of whatever you want (e.g.,
what methods have been parsed, what variables, tokens), and you pass
them to the platform's APIs specifically designed for parsing,
highlighting, etc. All of the threading/highlighting/user interface
work is done for you, is commercially scalable, and works extremely
well behind the scenes.

Like anything, it isn't trivial to do, but the APIs for parsing/code
completion/syntax highlighting are pretty straightforward and there
are tutorials online on how to do it with ANTLR. Here's one, for
example:

Hope that helps,

Helllo!!

I think this is an old topic, but looking at the list I haven't found a
clear answer to the problem. I am trying to do a system that opens in a
swing panel an specific type file, which follows my specific grammar and
allows its editing.
Hence, I want to add syntax-highlighting and also auto completion to the
file (both in the editing and in the only reading), But also I should show
the syntax tree.

I have my ANTLR grammar running (pluto.g) and tested with current output
as a flat AST tree. But I am not entirely sure what to do next.

My first option is to specify as output templates and use directly from
the parser grammar StringTemplate with the output specifying the colors,
font, etc in a kind of HTML similar code and later plug-in in the swing
panel
Second option, is to create a Parser Tree and later on, use the templates
Third, forget the parser and just use the lexer????

The problem is that the final goal of the system is to create SQL queries
to insert/modify in a DB the information that contains the grammar.

Any outputs are welcome, thanks

How the heck would you write a pattern based rule for static *flow
analysis* to check if there is a path that does not end in return?

I'll be so bold as to say that you can't unless you hand-coded it.

&gt;<i> &gt;ST has

</I>&gt;<i> Why not just compute the flow analysis as needed?

</I>&gt;<i> My general objection to the tree walker is that I don't see it as 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;guiding general output generation&quot;, but
</I>&gt;<i> rather as &quot;embedding calls to the code that does all the work at

</I>
Hardly arbitrary. Is your software open source? I'd like to take a look
at how you managed to do all these wonderful things without writing
code.

&gt;<i> I'd rather have code that says &quot;Here are my 200 rules, in the order they 
</I>&gt;<i> should fire&quot;. That seems like
</I>&gt;<i> the better way to &quot;guide output generation&quot;.
</I>
So rather than use existing languages than tools, invent your own?

All,

A few weeks ago (just before the ANTLR workshop in SFO) I managed to 
get a pure Python version of ANTLR working on the calc example. 
However, there are still a few problems in de code generator that 
need to be sorted out, so I am asking for help. I will post the 
ANTLR-Python stuff as a patch on the antlr-2.7.4 code in the files 
section of this group.

To get this working, you need to have everything available to build 
ANTLR and also have a recent (newer than version 2.1) Python on your 
system. Then do the following (UNIX only):
1. untar the antlr-2.7.4 archive
   gtar zxf antlr-2.7.4.tar.gz
2. patch the antlr-2.7.4 directory with the antlr-python patch
   patch -p0 &lt; antlr-2.7.4-python-041101.diff
3. Enter the antlr-2.7.4 directory and configure and build antlr as
   usual.
4. Go to the lib/python directory and run
   python setup.py install
   This will build and install the ANTLR-Python runtime
5. Go to the examples/python/calc directory and build and run the
   example.
   antlr calc.g
   python Calc.py &lt; test.in

The problems I have currently are in the examples/python/lexertester 
directory. There are a few simple tests here, but the generated code 
will give errors due to incorrect indentation. Explanation: instead 
of braces, Python uses indentation to mark blocks of code. In the 
case of the generated code, the opening brace could be replaced by 
an if statement that is always open (example: &quot;if True:&quot;) followed 
by an increased indentation level, while the closing brace can be 
replaced by just a decreased indentation level. My problem is that I 
just can't find where to do this for a single action item, such as a 
pair of spurious braces. Just have a look at the generated code in 
the lexertester examples to see what I mean.

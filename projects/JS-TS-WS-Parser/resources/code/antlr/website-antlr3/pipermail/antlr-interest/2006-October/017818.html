   Aren't these standard operations and data structures?    Symbol  
table, use-def chains, flow analysis.  The tree walk can simply ask  
questions of these data structures.

&gt;&gt;<i> My main point is that it's ok to have multiple tree structures, L

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a total  pain I've found.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it's a royal pain, but if you start with the requirement that  
</I>&gt;<i> you will produce &quot;natural&quot; code, there's no choice.
</I>
   Well, I suppose anything is possible, it's just a matter of how  
convenient.  And you are saying it's inconvenient really not impossible.

&gt;<i> I think just this simple example that I brought up before actually  
</I>&gt;<i> brings the problem to the surface:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> String hello = &quot;hello&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i> String world = &quot;world&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i> printf(&quot;%s %s\n&quot;, hello, world);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...becomes...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> System.out.println(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can't see how that can be done by treewalking. By the time the  
</I>&gt;<i> code is actually written to implement &quot;printf to System.out.println&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> there will be almost no &quot;tree-transformation&quot; or even &quot;tree  
</I>&gt;<i> walking&quot; logic.
</I>
   The logic is identifying that you have entered a list of  
statements and you see a print statement.  The translation logic is a  
simple one-to-one mapping from printf to println just as you would do  
in a rule right?  The only problem is discovering what should be the  
expression.  Either in a previous phase I would have done constant  
propagation or in your case you ask the question or something in one  
of your declaration rules.  Do you insert actions in your rules to go  
check data structures?  Surely you don't write a rule that has a   
context-sensitive pattern  asking if there have been all possible  
variable declarations before the print, right?

&gt;<i> As for the try/catch, all the work is in finding a good &quot;level&quot; to  
</I>&gt;<i> insert the try/catch. For example, if we have three consecutive
</I>&gt;<i> read() calls, best to put them into a single try/catch. If we need  
</I>&gt;<i> to catch both FileNotFoundException and IOException
</I>&gt;<i> for one statement, and just IOException for the following  
</I>&gt;<i> statement, what do we do?
</I>
  how do you handle that?  I very is to to learn more about your  
approach; I see you talking about how the tree walking won't work,  
but I don't see how yours will work.  It is very interesting and I  
want to learn more.

&gt;<i> Thanks for your patience - guess I'm a natural contrarian :)
</I>
   Always good for an excellent discussion and to shake things up...

<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Although 'retroweaver' sounds good, I dont see how it will convert
</I>&gt;<i> some stuff like the new classes for thread management (by Doug Lea).
</I>&gt;<i> Also some of those new language features do take off a bit of load
</I>&gt;<i> (esp the enhanced for loop). 
</I>
Well, the threading probably doesn't apply to ANTLR, and I don't see how
the enhanced for loop should be any faster, but whatever.

&gt;<i> Also I really dont understand why people dont want to switch to java
</I>&gt;<i> 5. i mean the jvm is100% backward compatible with 1.4 plus it will run
</I>&gt;<i> your 1.5 programs too.
</I>
Up until recently there was neither a 1.5 JVM for AIX nor for MacOS, and
there are those companys who rather terrorize their employees than just
let them install their JVM of choice ...

A 1.5 feature I consider quite important never gets mentioned btw:
overriding methods can now declare a subclass as the return type, e.g.
if you have &quot;class B extends A {}&quot; and some method &quot;A doFoo()&quot; you can
override it to &quot;B doFoo()&quot;. User correctly this can significantly
enhance APIs and type safety.

Martin

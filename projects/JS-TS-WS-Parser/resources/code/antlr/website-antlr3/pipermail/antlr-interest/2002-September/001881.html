<PRE>FYI there are separate options for lexer, parser and tree parser.  

They are:

-trace
-traceLexer
-traceParser
-traceTreeWalker

Rule level might be nice, but I've never needed it.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [antlr-interest] trace as an grammar and rule option
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a situation where I can only reproduce a bug by testing my 
</I>&gt;<i> grammar on a file that is about 20k lines long. I used antlr and 
</I>&gt;<i> turned on -traceParser, and this looks like it will generate the 
</I>&gt;<i> output I need, however it is taking a very long time to run... 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was wondering if anybody has ever thought about a trace option at 
</I>&gt;<i> the grammar and at the rule level?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been poking around in the antlr source, and I think it would be 
</I>&gt;<i> implemented very much like the defaultErrorHandler option. It seems 
</I>&gt;<i> that the touch points would be the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> MakeGrammar.java is the only place the creates rule blocks. When it 
</I>&gt;<i> creates them, it copies the defaultErrorHandler option from the 
</I>&gt;<i> grammar. I think the same rules would apply for a trace option.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> JavaCodeGenerator.java checks the grammar for the traceRules flag. 
</I>&gt;<i> This would be changed to test the rule block currently in context.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Grammar.java the setOption method would be modified to allow a trace 
</I>&gt;<i> option.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> RuleBlock.java the setOption method would be modified to allow a 
</I>&gt;<i> trace option.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are there any other touch points that I missed?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think this would be useful because I would be able to reduce the 
</I>&gt;<i> number of rules that are trace that I really don't care about. At 
</I>&gt;<i> this time, my test for debugging takes enough time that I was able to 
</I>&gt;<i> research this change and start on the changes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From my research, I think the changes would allow the option in 
</I>&gt;<i> lexers, parsers, and tree parsers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If anybody thinks this is useful, I would be more that willing to 
</I>&gt;<i> submit the source files, or a diff patch back to the list. I'm using 
</I>&gt;<i> 2.7.2a2, so I think this is fairly recent.
</I>&gt;<i>

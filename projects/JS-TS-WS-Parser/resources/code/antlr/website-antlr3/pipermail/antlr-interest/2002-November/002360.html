&gt;<i> &gt; Uh oh...Houston we have a problem...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;delurk&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> So, for the sake of those of us playing along at home, what does 
</I>this 
&gt;<i> mean in terms of the suitability of versions of Antlr?  Let's 
</I>pretend 
&gt;<i> that I am using Antlr for real, honest-to-goodness production work.
</I>
Are you having any problems with the version of ANTLR that you are 
using for this production work?

&gt;<i> Should I use:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - 2.7.1  (last 'stable' release)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - 2.7.2aX, where X appears to be 5 at the moment
</I>
It depends on the question asked above. It's fair to say that 2.7.2a2 
has undergone heavy testing over the course of the year. It certainly 
qualifies as production quality for many people.

I'd advise obtaining a copy of 2.7.1 and 2.7.2a2 at the very least. 
Try 2.7.2a2 on your project and only regress to 2.7.1 if you find a 
problem that 2.7.2a2 introduces. I doubt most people will find any 
such problem.

&gt;<i> Should I use the latest and greatest 2aX release if I am not using 
</I>&gt;<i> Heterogeneous ASTs, and 2.7.1 otherwise?
</I>
As for versions later than 2.7.2a2, I'd re-read Ter's post &quot;new Java 
grammar AND 2.7.2a4 10-27-2002 version available&quot; to decide whether 
2.7.2a4 and later versions have a fix for an issue that's holding you 
back. If not, you should try them anyway against a copy of your 
project(s). Any issues you report will help to improve ANTLR for us 
all.

&lt;aside&gt;
Are you using or, have you wanted to use Heterogeneous ASTs with 
ANTLR?
&lt;/aside&gt;

Enjoy!,

Micheal

PS   If you try 2.7.2a4+ and find no issues, please consider posting 
a message to that effect with some summary information about the 
project(s) you used ANTLR 2.7.2a4+ with. Knowing what works is as 
important as knowing what doesn't  ;-)

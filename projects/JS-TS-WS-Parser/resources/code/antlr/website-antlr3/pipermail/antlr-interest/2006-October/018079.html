<PRE>Hello All:

I'm still waiting to see any of my earlier posts acknowledged by this 
mailing list, however,
they aren't showing up, so I am not sure what is happening (it's been 
several business days).
If anyone gets this, please reply directly to me (or cc me and send to the 
mailing list if it
is of general interest). I have started development using ANTLR and 
advocated it to my
team as (1) generating java source, (2) being hardened by widespread use and
(3) actively supported.  Please back me up on the actively supported part, I 
don't want
to look foolish  :-).

For my job, I am writing a tool to parse a language, that for historical 
reasons has
what I'll call &quot;undelimited strings&quot;, which are positional string parameters 
with white space delimiiters.
The problem becomes that if the undelimited string has a prefix that matches 
a keyword,
then the scanner will call it a keyword and not a string (which is 
understandable but not the
behavior I want).  I would like to control when keywords are recognized by 
the lexer, and
I would like to activate/deactivate this control in parser actions.  In the 
lexer, I added a public
boolean flag &quot;recognizeKeyWords&quot; which appears to work in a toy example, 
however, I don't know
how to access the extended lexer class resulting from my ANTLR file to 
control this flag.
Is there a way to do this, if so, what is the java/ANTLR syntax?

As an example, please see a small ANTLR file and Java example are appended 
to the end of this
message.

Thanks:

Bill M.

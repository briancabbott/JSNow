</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Others in this thread have pointed out that you should use ($rhs.tree != null) in your if statement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to, respectfully, suggest that you are doing the Wrong Thing(TM) in your action code.
</I>&gt;<i> And it is wrong on two levels - the first mis-use is rather shallow and the second is a rather more
</I>&gt;<i> deeper mis-use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I mean nothing personal nor pejorative by these comments. I am just trying to point out a couple
</I>&gt;<i> of &quot;better&quot; ways to do the above. And of course &quot;better&quot; is a qualitative assessment unique to each
</I>&gt;<i> reader of this message (e.g. what is &quot;better&quot; to me may not be &quot;better&quot; to you...).
</I>
Understood. No offense taken :).

&gt;<i> The first, shallow, mis-use (IMHO) is to not simply let the Tree Walker code decide for you whether
</I>&gt;<i> or not the rhs tree node is present. That is, instead of
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; | ^(MINUS lhs=baseExpression rhs=baseExpression?) { /* figure out what to do */ }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> do something like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; | ^(MINUS lhs=baseExpression) { /* handle the 1-arity '-' operator here */ }
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; | ^(MINUS lhs=baseExpression rhs=baseExpression) { /* handle the 2-arity subtraction here */ }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. the Tree Walker code has to already poke around in your tree in order to determine whether or
</I>&gt;<i> not the rhs is present (as part of its tree pattern matching) --- so let it control the invocation
</I>&gt;<i> of your actions.
</I>
Good suggestion.

&gt;<i> The second, i think deeper, mis-use is that you have (apparently) discarded information discovered
</I>&gt;<i> during parsing and AST creation that you could use to guide your subsequent AST processing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Surely in your Parser the 1-arity '-' appears in a different syntactic context from the 2-arity '-'
</I>&gt;<i> operator ---- so when parsing &quot;a+-b&quot; we know that the '-' must be the 1-arity operator, but when we
</I>&gt;<i> parse &quot;a-b&quot; we know that the '-' must be the 2-arity operator.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I suggest to you that your Parser should differentiate the MINUS tree --- since, I assert, that
</I>&gt;<i> it already does so as part of the parse --- by creating a different (with imaginary root) node for
</I>&gt;<i> the 1-arity case. So &quot;a+-b&quot; obtains the tree (PLUS a (NEGATE b)) and &quot;a-b&quot; obtains the tree
</I>&gt;<i> (MINUS a b) or something similar in accord with your taste...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And so, with this approach, in all of your post-processing of the AST, the 1-arity and 2-arity
</I>&gt;<i> operations have already been differentiated in the tree itself and therefore can be directly
</I>&gt;<i> determined --- no need to noodle around about whether or not 1 or 2 children are present.
</I>
Very true. I know during the parse exactly which one it is, and I
intentionally created the AST the way it is, but inadvertently made it
harder for myself :(.  From now on, I'll  &quot;always remember to keep
information available in the initial parse for later passes.&quot;

I was hoping to subvert some of these problems / poor decisions by
asking about best practices for AST building
(<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2009-October/036238.html">http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2009-October/036238.html</A>),
but nobody responded at the time.

&gt;<i> and there is also the possibility of having ONLY the 2-arity '-' operator because in Algebra
</I>&gt;<i> the 1-arity '-' is an implicit 2-arity operation involving zero. so the &quot;a+-b&quot; would become
</I>&gt;<i> (PLUS a (MINUS 0 b)) --- but this just tends to break my brain so i do not do that..... ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and, please, can we just not discuss the whole treatment of 2-arity '-' as an addition
</I>&gt;<i> with multiply by -1 ..... my brain tends to just shutdown at that prospect ;-)
</I>
I think both of these are worth considering in the context of the
target language / architecture.

Thank you for the suggestions, I appreciate the advise.

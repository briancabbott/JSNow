it's all about managing expectations. ;)

there was a serious space issue. I went like 100 pages over their  
original limit.  The targets and API would change often enough that I  
figured that should be in the wiki.  The javadoc is up for some  
targets already too.

you mean other than the complete grammar syntax I put in there?

It's all about how much I could cram in there.

Money makes me spend a lot more time on it than I would for free

Are you really saying that devoting 20 years of my life to make the  
best tools possible is not generous?  You kidding me?  others are  
more generous?  You've got to be kidding me.  People swoop in and  
built a few patches or whatever and then move on.  Rare few start  
building something of value and keep honing it. How many people do  
you know that have been dedicated to free software for as long as I  
have?  I am working on the doc and you can help add more doc.

I get $3 measly dollars when you buy the book at amazon.  I want all  
you whiners about the doc to either decide you can't use the tool  
because it's not well documented enough or suck it up and start  
helping out.  Most of the whiners are freeloaders....complaining, but  
never having contributed themselves to open source or ANTLR before.   
Bunch of ungrateful freeloaders...how dare you make these demands!

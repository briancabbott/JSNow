<PRE>I have been trying all day to get the rule below accepted (oh yeah,  
that doesn't count about 2 hours wasted before I figured out that you  
can't have a space after the right curly brace and the question mark  
in a semantic predicate  (grin))

I get a &quot;cannot generate the grammar because&quot; error  which is

     rule expression alt 1 uses rewrite syntax and also an AST operator

Now, I'm pretty certain this is happening because of the &quot;^&quot; that  
follows lhs = simpleExpression^ in the first section of the rule.

However, removing that operator causes no tree node to be generated in  
the case where there is just a simple expression.  However, I tried  
removing that operator and adding a rewrite rule after the FIRST  
closing right brace, e.g.

                lhs = simpleExpression
                   {
                      $type = $lhs.type;
                   } -&gt; ^($lhs)

and many variants but this just caused ANTLR to complain that  
comparisonOperator was an unexpected token.  I also tried inserting a  
third predicate in the bottom group that would test whether $rhs was  
null and just put out the $lhs in that case but that didn't work either.

Can somebody please put me out of my misery (in a kind manner (grin))  
and show me what I'm doing wrong? I'd love to have a quiet weekend  
with no problems to worry about!!!

Thanks,
D

expression returns [TAttributeType type]
                :
                optionalSign
                lhs = simpleExpression^
                   {
                      $type = $lhs.type;
                   }
                   (
                    (comparisonOperator rhs = simpleExpression)	
                    {
                       $type =  
TErrorHandling.Compatible($comparisonOperator.tree.token,  
$comparisonOperator.token, $lhs.type, $rhs.type);
                    }

                      -&gt; { isString($lhs.type) }? ^(comparisonOperator  
STRINGOP $lhs $rhs)
                      -&gt;  ^(comparisonOperator $lhs $rhs)
                   )* 	
	        ;

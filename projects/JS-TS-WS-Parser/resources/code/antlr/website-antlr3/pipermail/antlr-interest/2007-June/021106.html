<PRE>El 5/6/2007, a las 22:05, Jim Idle escribi&#243;:

&gt;<i> I think that this may well be co-incidence. The previous poster has
</I>&gt;<i> written a parser entirely as a lexer and that is why it is taking so
</I>&gt;<i> long to produce the output. As another poster said, if you take you  
</I>&gt;<i> one
</I>&gt;<i> or two the lexer fragment rules, then the lexer generation can breath
</I>&gt;<i> and it doesn't take so long. It looks to me like that is the issue  
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> the other grammar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While I cannot be certain, from what you said you were trying to do, I
</I>&gt;<i> think you were seeing a similar problem, with trying to make the lexer
</I>&gt;<i> too complicated and having non fragment lexer rules embedded in other
</I>&gt;<i> rules and so on. Hence you do not see these issue until you try to
</I>&gt;<i> generate the lexer. If ANTLRWorks were to try and find out if this  
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> happen, it would, guess what, have to pretty much generate the lexer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are trying to specify things that look suspiciously like syntax
</I>&gt;<i> in the lexer, then you are doing it in the wrong place basically. Just
</I>&gt;<i> list all the thing s that can be tokenized, then tell the parser  
</I>&gt;<i> what is
</I>&gt;<i> and is not a valid order.
</I>
The reason I approached it this way is like I said in my original post:

&gt;<i> The internal structure of the URI isn't of any interest to me, I  
</I>&gt;<i> just want to get a token for each URI, so I'm doing all this in the  
</I>&gt;<i> lexer.
</I>
But I can certainly try doing less in the lexer and more in the  
parser if it will solve these problems.

One of the reasons why I wanted URIs to be returned as a single token  
is that it would make the rest of the parser/lexer simpler... the  
sample grammar I posted was just for testing purposes, recognizing  
URIs in isolation, but this is all destined for a wiki markup  
translator, of which recognizing URIs will be just one small part...

Cheers,
Wincent

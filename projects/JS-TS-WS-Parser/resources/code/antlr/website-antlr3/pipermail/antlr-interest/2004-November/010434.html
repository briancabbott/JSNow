Scarab &lt;<A HREF="http://scarab.tigris.org/">http://scarab.tigris.org/</A>&gt; gets pretty good reviews as being
easy to install, full-featured, and easy to use.  It is implemented
via Java Servlets.

</I>
Apples and oranges.  ANTLR (nee PCCTS) is a significant step up over
table-driven LALR and parse trees.  StringTemplate sounds like (I
still haven't used it yet--something to learn this weekend) a novel
paradigm which also makes life easier.

C'mon Ter--how many years have you lived off of Sun Java?  The above
is a neanderthal view, which you don't really practice--there is an
incredible amount of professionally written free software out there
these days.  Some of it is corporate flagship software released as
Open Source (eclipse, Java, OpenOffice, ...), some of it is useful
software tools which probably would either not be commercially
viable--it is hard to make money selling software tools these days--or
are to advance the state of the practice (JUnit and ArgoUML are good
examples of this), some of it is free because the underlying design
concepts are still undergoing evolution, and some of it is free as a
means of advertising professional skills.  User support for Open
Source software is often better than for an equivalent commercial
product--and, for software with active developers, the Open Source
product has a good chance of surpassing the commercial competition.

That said, there is also a considerable amount of non-professional,
single-developer software out there that is not well written.  Part of
the effort in adopting any software is that you have to do a product
analysis.  Is the software mature?  Is there a likelihood of support?
 Is there an active developer community?  And it ain't just the free
software for which that applies--there is a fair amount of dreck being
marketed commercially.  Caveat emptor!

&gt;<i> with Matt Benson at the moment to create HumAnt, a human readable 
</I>&gt;<i> version of Ant with its filthy xml spec.  Oddly enough what I came up 
</I>&gt;<i> with looks like make w/o the whitespace issue. ;)
</I>
Gack!!!  One of the nice things about modern IDEs is that they
generate Ant or make code for you, and provide wizards to guide you
through the rarely used (&quot;advanced&quot;) features when needed.  Textual
representations of dependency relationships are good for processing,
but mediocre for communicating to humans.  The &quot;filthy xml spec&quot; is a
feature--it is just enough pain that people have been driven to put
together friendly GUI front ends.  Makefiles are traditionally
incomprehensible to the average user--how would HumAnt be an
improvement with a make-like syntax?

Cheers!

Oh, right.  Yeah, i won't be using generics...don't need 'em.

not a problem.  Just a subgroup of the main Java template group.  I'm  
using this very example in my ST paper.

&gt;<i> I'd be up to the task of writing the ST templates for Java 1.5 if

</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR library using 1.4 or 1.5 could become an issue.

Ah.  That is true.

&gt;<i> About the AST interface, I wouldn't say I got &quot;bitten hard&quot; by it, but
</I>&gt;<i> I started using it and quickly noticed it was too restrictive. I

</I>&gt;<i> AST.
</I>
Ok, well, seems like Object as the AST type is pretty useful then.   
I'll leave it.

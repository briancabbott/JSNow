<PRE>IF you have problems with the C grammar in the examples you 
could try my latest version of the C/C++ grammar file, CPP_parser.g.

This version, developed from an earlier version by Terence and 
others back in 1994, uses ANTLR 2.7.1. It does run with ANTLR 
2.7.2, but I had a lot of hassle getting to work.

At present it generates a parser in C++ only (If anyone is 
interested in developing a Java version, perhaps they could let 
me know).

In September I supplied a much improved version which I called V 
2.0. This version was picked up by some users and just a few 
problems were raised which have now been solved.

I assume &quot;no news&quot; is good news!

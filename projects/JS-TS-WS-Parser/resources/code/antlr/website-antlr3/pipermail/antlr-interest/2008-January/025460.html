Hi Jim,

Once I again I want repeat this question :-)

1) we have few year ago made SQL grammar for ANTLR 2.7.2 made with C++
target.

So I wonder, how easy will be port this to C target.
And what you mean with
&gt;<i>    eventually it will be better to have C++ based actions of course&quot;.
</I>
You mean now in C target we cannot have actions as

    {
        MyClass * p = new MyClass()
        i.e. Some C++ code
    }

?


2) also I have come to all these issues because again did profile of 100K-1M
INSERTS, and I see big troubles in ANTLR 2.7.2 C++ runtime. As far as I
could see problem come from LA() which calls a lots NextToken() which
creates std::string() what cause call of new() (and later free.

ANTLR parser looks to work 8-10 times slower of YACC or Lemon. And I think
because of this reason.

I have check -- and it seems to be deal of few hard days work to try remove
std::string from C++ runtime of ANTLR 2.7.2 and using instead just
    pair  { char*, length }
    where char* points right into string we do parse.
    I do not see any need today do COPY of each token string.
    btw, how you have implement this in C runtime for v3 ?

Before to do this I was going to check state of deal in ANTLR 3,
and I see that C++ runtime even not exists.

My advice will be not use std::string at all, and do not make not required
copies of strings into each Token object.

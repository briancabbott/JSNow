<PRE>Don&#8217;t do that. The count will be available to you in the tree parser as the
args will be in a vector and you can reference the count of the list. You
are trying to do too much in the parser basically.

*Subject:* Re: [antlr-interest] array list action attributes



I would prefer to handle the actions as suggested above, but in most cases I
need to know how many elements exist first.  So what I've been doing is
collecting them, getting the count, then processing them.



This is all in a tree walker grammar.  Is there an easy way to write out the
count in the lexer/parser grammar rewrite rules so it's available to the
tree walker without having to gather them first as I've been doing?



For example, I'd like to be able to do something like this (in the
lexer/parser grammar):



functionLiteral

          :           'function' name=NameLiteral? args=parameters
body=block

          -&gt;         ^( FUNC $name? $args-&gt;count $args $body )

          ;



But the $args-&gt;count obviously won't work since the output tree is
homogenous.  I imagine there might be a way to create a dummy node with the
value as a payload, but I haven't tracked down the syntax for that yet.



Perhaps I'm still going about this the wrong way?

</I>


Yep.  I was more hoping that there was higher level syntax in the ANTLR
language itself that could be used to autogenerate the API calls when
working with those vectors (making the grammar a bit more portable in the
process).  I was aware of the single element support (e.g. $arg.text), and
hoped I had simply missed the multi-value support.  Failing that, I was
familiar with the SCOPE macros that the C target provides for hiding some of
the data structure API details, and imagined similar macros had been created
for working with the += output that I had maybe missed.  It sounds like
neither of those are the case, so working directly with the API calls is the
correct/only path currently.



Thanks!

Unless you don't care too much about memory (memory for the STRINGs is not
released until you free the parser), then I would just get the pointers
from the token directly and copy whatever text you want from there.

However, I think that your confusion here is that you are gathering a list
then trying to process it afterwards, where I think you will find it more
useful to do this (and note that you use + as otherwise if there are no
IDs then it is just a TYPE alt):

:<i> TYPE // No IDs
</I>|<i> ^(TYPE
</I>
     (
       i=ID { some code that does $i.whatever }
     )+
 )
 { action code to finish up }
;

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR3 allows labeling attributes for referencing in actions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> decl: type id=ID ';' { print &quot;var&quot; + $id.text; }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the C language target, the $id.text gets converted nicely into:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (id-&gt;getText(id))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, if you have more than one attribute:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> decl: ^( TYPE ids+=ID* )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...$ids becomes a pANTLR3_VECTOR, and it appears those helpful
</I>&gt;<i> attributes no longer work?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was hoping something like $ids[i].text would get automatically
</I>&gt;<i> converted.
</I>&gt;<i>  Instead, I had to dig into the implementation a bit and hand-expand it
</I>&gt;<i> to:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> pANTLR_BASE_TREE id = (pANTLR_BASE_TREE)$ids-&gt;get($ids, i); const char*
</I>&gt;<i> name = (const char*)id-&gt;getText(id)-&gt;chars;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, I guess a couple questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Does the java language option suffer the same fate?  (i.e. ANTLR3
</I>&gt;<i> simply does not provide syntax for working with attributes on multi-
</I>&gt;<i> value labels?)
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Does the C API provide some nice macros I may have missed for making
</I>&gt;<i> this less gross?  (e.g. its set of SCOPE accessors)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,

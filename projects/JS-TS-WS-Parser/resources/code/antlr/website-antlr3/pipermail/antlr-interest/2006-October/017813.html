Hi Monty!  Nice to see you pop your head up!

Well, I'm not so much worried about how to differentiate the tree  
nodes per se.  I am concerned about making a union grammar that has  
to have both AREV_PLUS and VB_PLUS rules.  Or, if I'm doing this by  
hand, I have to have code that deals with both kinds of tree nodes.   
Propagating grammatical changes forward from phase n to n+i can be  
challenging even if using a grammar.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> program: (statement)*;

   Yes, but what happens when you decide that you need to do a  
transformation sooner than you had it before?  You need to modify all  
of the intermediate transformation phases to deal with new  
grammatical structure.  This cannot really be done automatically.

&gt;<i> I was raving about this like 7 years ago, it just totally rocks!
</I>
   I build my Fortran translators this way in the old days, but I  
just remember all of the pain when changing the phase in which I did  
a transformation because it ripples through the remaining phases.

&gt;<i> Check the archives for my posts about multiple tree grammars, or ask
</I>&gt;<i> questions if something isn't clear.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By the last pass, I had a completely vb tree, and then I finally
</I>&gt;<i> dumped it to text.
</I>
   Yes, that is the really great feature of this approach.

TXL uses the union grammar approach by the way also.

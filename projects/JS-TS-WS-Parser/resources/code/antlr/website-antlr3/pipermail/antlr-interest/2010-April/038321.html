<PRE>Now that I think about it, it seems a lot more likely that the code from
the @after block would have instead been an action if the intent was to
only execute as an action (when not backtracking). However, IIRC some
items (maybe it's the token start/stop indices) are only set after the
inline actions run, so if you want to work with them you have to use the
@after{} block instead. I just checked my grammars and found that I
currently have *both* possibilities at different locations - some assume
that the code always runs, and others assume it's only during
backtracking.

Maybe we should allow a @finally{} block immediately following where the
@init{} block goes?

Hi Ron,

I think this behavior is as intended. The @init block is intended to
declare local variables. Therefore, it will always be executed. 
You could move the action, manipulating your stack, out of the @init
block into an action inside the rule. Then, it would not get executed
during lookahead.
I don't know if it is favorable, but if this manipulation of the stack
is required in the subrules to correctly decide on alternatives, you
could leave the action in @init and put the cleanup action (form @after)
to the &quot;finally&quot; block, which will always get executed, regardless of
the backtracking state.

I hope this helps.
Thomas

Betreff: [antlr-interest] @init actions executed during lookahead,
@after actions not

Hi,

I just ran into something a little odd. I'm using @init actions in some
parser rules to stack some information and @after to pop it again. In
the generated Java code, the @after action gets wrapped in an &quot;if (
state.backtracking==0 ) {...}&quot;, so that it only gets executed when other
actions are being executed, not during lookahead. This is what I
expected. But I noticed that the @init actions are executed
unconditionally, including during lookahead. I didn't expect this. The
result was a lot of junk on the stack when it went into a dfa. The fix
was easy enough, just checking state.backtracking myself. But I was
wondering if this is an Antlr bug or if it's supposed to work this way.

Ron

Sounds like it. I think the information I need is in the &lt;Name&gt;.tokens  
file, though, so possibly I could generate some code from that.

</I>
The changes are fairly trivial:

- fixed a few compiler warnings (for my grammar at least)
- added some types to cTypeInitMap (some standard, some specific to my  
project)
- #undef ADD (which is defined by a system header somwhere, annoyingly)
- a quick fix to get my grammar building under MinGW.

I've attached a diff against C.stg from 3.1.3.


&gt;<i> I don't know when you split, but there have been
</I>&gt;<i> one or two tweaks to C.stg, so make sure you pick them up.
</I>
I'm keeping it up to date with your changes.


Thanks for your help,
Ned.

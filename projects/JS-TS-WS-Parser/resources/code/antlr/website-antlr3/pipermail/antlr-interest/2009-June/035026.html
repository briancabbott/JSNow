<PRE>Thanks for the help Gavin.

Let me see if I understand this correctly; I'm trying to get my head down
into this.

On &quot;top-level lexer rules should not refer to other top-level lexer rules&quot;:
What constitutes a &quot;top-level lexer rule?&quot; Is that fragment vs. non-fragment
(non-fragments are top-level)?  Also, if one top-level lexer rule refers to
another, but adds additional rules, doesn't that remove the ambiguity?

On &quot;&quot;EOL should be a parser rule&quot;:  Can you help me understand how a rule
which can match zero characters creates an infinite loop?  Does making it a
parser rule avoid that?  If so, how?

Sean

</I>&gt;<i> Also, your EOL rule was a top-level lexer rule that can successfully match

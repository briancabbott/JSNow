I meant, that ANTLR - or any other parser - could have as an
implementation a combined parser/lexer. It was supposed to be a
hypothetical supposition, which was supposed to show that the ANTLR
convention regarding parser and lexer rules isn't mere a &quot;Best Practice&quot;
to allow people to differentiate parser and lexer rules by their name
alone, but actively enforced. And because it is actively enforced, the
code analyzing the rules has a way to distinguish between both
varieties. And I heavily suspect that the key for this is the
referencing of other rules.

In any case, the actual point of my first email was that the behaviour
should be more explicitly documented, so first time users like me don't
have to struggle to get things right. Taking into account that at this
time not many successful tries for writing an own grammar could have
been done, it ends to be discouraging people from ANTLR use. I know this
personally from TYPO 3 - the gap between trivial templates and the
sophisticated ones is too big to cross for casual users and those go to
simpler CMS like Joomla.

Best regards,
Johannes Luber

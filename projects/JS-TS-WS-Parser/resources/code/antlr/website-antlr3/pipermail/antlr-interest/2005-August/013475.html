 Dear Mr. Christopher Schultz,
 
 many thanks for your answer.
 
 &gt; This is a BIG BIG task, and very difficult. ANTLR can help you parse the
 &gt; source code, but you're going to have to write a very complicated
 &gt; translator
 
 Maybe I'm completely wrong, but I think about ANTLR as a tool
 to generate translators from a grammars. C++ grammar is also
 present on ANTLR page or &quot;John's PCCTS-based C++ Parser Page&quot;.
 So maybe it is only necessary to define some lexical rules with actions,
 that means only expand a given grammar or generated classes with
 user-defined actions. I don't know.
 
 &gt; which knows what type variables are (i.e. for overloading)
 &gt; and all kinds of stuff like that.
 
 
 In one newsgroup message I can read :
 &quot;However, I have built a C++ scarfer for somebody that was 
 able to pick out class members and func defs relatively easily.  There's 
 no short cut for full C++ unfortunately.  Soon the World will fall back on another 
 language (with a sigh) or to a subset (with a snicker). &quot; wroten by Terence J. Parr.
 But no future references to this 
 Maybe You know what this means? This can be very helpfully.
 
 &gt; Why don't you just use CLR's ability to execute compiled C++ code
 &gt; directly? I'm not sure of Mono compiles C++, but the MS compiler
 &gt; certainly does.
 
 No, not really, It is possible to generate &quot;unchecked&quot; (old common) C++ library
 an call functions to that library. But this have for my purposes to much disadvantages.
 1. It is only &quot;ok&quot; to call relative simple functions with simple data
 2. for complex types we must do complex marshaling (which very slow!)
 3. for complex types we must carefully define appropriate types in C# and maybe define proxy-functions in C++ library
 4. for point 3 we must also write a INTEROP &quot;calling&quot; Interface (this is like my first question) for each exported C++ function.
 At this point it can be very complicated to do this marshaling at all, if we use something like std::list&lt;T&gt; (it is much likely generic List&lt;T&gt;) in C# and can be very time and memory expensive.
 5. we have all the disadvantages of C# combined with disadvantages of C++ (i.e. insecure pointers)
 6. no callback possibilities (events, actions) from C++ to C# or I don't know how to do it, but in this case it is necessary to rewrite C++
 library at all
 7. no reasonable debugging possibilities
 8. and of course I wish continue developing of the library later without having of C# and C++ mixing.
 
 I think, it is at a starting point a very big task, but can save a lot of time later.
 
 
 Best regards,
 Alexander Landa

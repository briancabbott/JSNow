<PRE>I'm working with much larger input files (a few thousand normal source
code files).

 

The significant action performed on a TreeNodeStream is a call to
LA(int32). For BufferedTreeNodeStream, this encloses the call to
FillBuffer().

 

The profiler revealed that BufferedTreeNodeStream.LA used 3.10% of the
inclusive profiling samples. CommonTreeNodeStream.LA used only 1.95%
over the same operation. I believe that for expected case inputs,
CommonTreeNodeStream is the preferred TreeNodeStream, and the current
performance is no worse than BufferedTreeNodeStream.

 

In FastQueue&lt;T&gt;, constructor the list (FastQueue&lt;T&gt;.data) with a default
capacity of 20. Let me know if the performance of CommonTreeNodeStream
improves.

Subject: Re: [antlr-interest] Resetting an AST tree walker

 

&lt;&lt;I'm surprised by the speed difference though. I might have to rethink
my filter; that is, which stream it uses.&gt;&gt;
My test case which I execute 1,000,000 times:
((2*3*4)/(2*3*4)+10*(5+5))*.5


Execution time Using BufferedTreeNodeStream is 5855 ms.
                CommonTree commonTree=(CommonTree)ast.getTree();
                TreeNodeStream nodes=new
BufferedTreeNodeStream(commonTree);
                TreeParser walker=new MyTreeParser(nodes);

Execution time Using CommonTreeNodeStream is 17387 ms.
                CommonTree commonTree=(CommonTree)ast.getTree();
                TreeNodeStream nodes=new
CommonTreeNodeStream(commonTree);
                TreeParser walker=new MyTreeParser(nodes);

The performance difference would vary based on how many times you
execute the case.  My application executes code like this a lot, so I
used a high numbered test case.

Calling reset on both BufferedTreeNodeStream and CommonTreeNodeStream
both work properly for my code.   If I call TreeParser.reset() the
subsquent calls give me the following message:  MyTreeParser.g: node
from line 0:0 no viable alternative at input 'EOF'

What method should I call to allow me to keep looping the TreeParser?
Calling it on the NodeStreams seem to work, but I don't know if that is
the preferred approach.  Also, is there a reason reset() isn't defined
on either TreeNodeStream or IntStream.  It forces me to do a typecast
like the following:  

             private void resetStream() {
                TreeNodeStream nodeStream=getTreeNodeStream();
                if (nodeStream instanceof BufferedTreeNodeStream) 
                  ((BufferedTreeNodeStream)nodeStream).reset();
                else if (nodeStream instanceof CommonTreeNodeStream) 
                  ((CommonTreeNodeStream)nodeStream).reset();

             }

Thanks for your help.

I wonder what the logic is there.  One of the big benefits of a tree
walker is to be able to repeatedly walk the nodes.  I hope they don't
remove that capability from the BufferedTreeNodeStream.

 

Don't worry. We will keep the buffered version for sure. The primary
reason to avoid the buffered version is when you're tree is absolutely
huge and you can afford to create a big array pointing and all the
nodes.  In the new tree filter mechanism, not yet officially released
but in the software, it needs to constantly parse little snippets of the
tree. re-creating an array for each subtree doesn't make much sense.

I'm surprised by the speed difference though. I might have to rethink my
filter; that is, which stream it uses.

	 

	Did that one work for you?  Except for increased memory is there
ever a reason not to use BufferedTreeNodeStream instead of
CommonTreeNodeStream?

 

Nope.

Ok, just checked.  Added 2 unit tests.  TreeIterator and
CommonTreeNodeStream reset properly.  Perhaps it's the tree parser?

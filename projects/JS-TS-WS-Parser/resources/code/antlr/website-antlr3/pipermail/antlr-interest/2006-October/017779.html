<PRE>Yay - a Reply! I was thinking my mails weren't getting through for a
minute there ;)

Hmm, I considered this originally, but I think I only need 3 passes, so
while it's a big hassle, using grammars has take out a huge wodge of
time in getting it up and running , whereas I feel that walking the
tree's manually would probably have taken a fair bit longer. With 8
passes , unless there's another way to skip branches in the tree, then I
think you definitely made the right choice. I think 3 passes with a
grammar isn't all that bad, 4 passes is definitely borderline.

Ahhh mid-email ah-ha moment!.... maybe.. I think I've got it. Grammar
inheritance. (that is if it's working in 3.0b4.) maintain a base class
tree grammar, and then override the relevant branches for each pass. -
unless your parser grammar changes a branch you've overridden, you'll
only have the base class to implement the standard walk in. 
Yeah, I think that should do it.... Off to give it a go now. 

Cheers for the input anyway Paul!

Rob

Hmm strange. No problems here on solaris. Which make are you using? GNU
Make 3.79.1 works perfectly here.

&gt;<i> Also if you dare do a 'make clean' at any point you loose the jars and

</I>
There's a bootstrap rule for that. Usually I have an antlrall.jar in a safe
spot for boostrapping. Clean is clean. Common problem with compilers/tools
that are used to build themselves.

&gt;<i> For the existence of the jars themselves, I found the process a bit
</I>&gt;<i> confusing: when I untarred the tarball, there was an antlr.jar at the
</I>&gt;<i> top level directory but subsequent invocations (through the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> java -cp /user/ebiris/installs/antlr-2.7.2a2/antlrall.jar antlr.Tool 
</I>&gt;<i>  antlr.g
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> falls over, since the antlrall.jar is not there. I had to issue a
</I>&gt;<i> mkalljar first to get the jar, and then make would proceed.
</I>
Looks like packaging problem. Think the distro should contain antlrall.jar.
Well it's easily build usually.

&gt;<i> Also checking in the accompanying install.html does not help much...
</I>
Aye it's hopelessly outdated.

&gt;<i> I hope someone can enlighten me about the compilation errors above ...
</I>&gt;<i> I will try to patch things up but the process for antlr.jar and
</I>&gt;<i> antlrall.jar construction is not very clear to me.
</I>
Two ways basically. Use the makefiles and have some stuff done
automatically. Note that makes in subdirectories work (handy if you only
want to rebuild C++ part)

Or use the 'old' build/mkxxjar scripts and do some stuff like make install
manually.

All minor glitches so far.

Cheers,

Ric

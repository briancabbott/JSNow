I'm not sure I completely understand the rule level trace. I kindoff got a
hunch that you want to do something similar to parts of the parseView
hooks (look at the code generated with -debug)

Dunno, my first reaction is something like why not put a few println's in
the rule to see what happens? Done in a few minutes, nothing fancy always
works :) Of course it can very much be that I misunderstood what you want
to do exactly....

Cheers,

Ric

 Why don't we just invite them to dinner and massacre them all when they're
  drunk? You heard the man. There's seven hundred thousand of them. Ah? ..
           So it'd have to be something simple with pasta, then.

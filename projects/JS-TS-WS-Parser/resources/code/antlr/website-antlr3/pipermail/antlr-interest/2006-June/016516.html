<PRE>The problem with &quot;reply to&quot;, imho, is that for certain mailers (Outlook in =
particular) it makes it impossible to reply to the sender. This header over=
rides ALL the reply options :-(

Incidentally, the way the list does it now is the recommended rfc way to do=
 things - the original sender is the sender. Whatever you do, it's a bit of=
 a pain, and I'd much rather things were left as they are.

Cheers,
Wol

I think it is not good to change any of the original headers,
however I don't think there's problem to add new headers. The
mailing list system adds some mailing list specific headers (as per
RFC 2369 [1]) and I see them in my mail client [2] (though my mail
client is not aware of the purpose of these headers and doesn't
reply to the mailing list by default), and I've seen on some mailing
lists a 'Reply-To' header added (if it is not already specified by
the sender) pointing to the mailing list address, which helps in
this situation.

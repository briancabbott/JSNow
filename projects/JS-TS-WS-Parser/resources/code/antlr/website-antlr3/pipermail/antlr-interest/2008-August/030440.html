No, there's not a limit like that. The only problems I've had are  
codesize issues with Java, but that doesn't have anything to do with  
backtracking, anyway.

Either the language is highly ambiguous or you have a mistake in your  
grammar. SQL is not particularly nice as a language to parse...lots of  
room for mistakes :(
Try to understand where it starts becoming ambiguous and you'll  
eventually find it. Takes time and practice though.

cheers,

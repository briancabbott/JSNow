No, ANTLR will build you an AST when you specify &quot;output=AST&quot;, even if
you don't give it any instructions for doing so (putting ^ chars in
your grammar). It's just that the &quot;tree&quot; will degenerate/flat.

That doesn't seem like a good thing to me, and that's what I was
arguing in that other thread.

That's what it *should* do, IMHO, but that's not what it does.

(it 
&gt;<i> can't possibly know what kind of AST you want) whereas if you build the 
</I>&gt;<i> tree you will, well, not &quot;of necessity&quot; but almost certainly build an 
</I>&gt;<i> AST of sorts, reflecting your post-processing needs and thus the

</I>&gt;<i> divide tends to overlap neatly with the by-default vs. explicitly built 
</I>&gt;<i> divide.
</I>
I agree with you, but I think most here don't.

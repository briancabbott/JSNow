<PRE>
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To briefly return to the topic ;), if you are doing source-to-source  
</I>&gt;<i> translation, I would love to see a product that let's me see the  
</I>&gt;<i> effect of one certain rule not only by the grammatical structure of  
</I>&gt;<i> the (ENBF-)rules that drive it, but also by some form of  
</I>&gt;<i> visualization that let me see the big &quot;picture&quot; without having to  
</I>&gt;<i> simulate the parser/translator in my head. I am convinced that a  
</I>&gt;<i> visual representation of this process would speed up my work  
</I>&gt;<i> tremendously.

Yes! Suppose we're changing a &quot;long&quot; variable to be &quot;BigDecimal&quot;.
So, for example, &quot;i + 3&quot; becomes &quot;i.add(3)&quot;.
I'd rather have a set of rules that look like this:

v + x --&gt; v.add(x)

...than the correct-but-nontrivial tree version:

PLUS
  v
  x
--&gt;
METHOD_CALL
   DOT
      v
      add
   ELIST
      x

I'm sorry, but I just didn't know, off the top of my head, what the AST 
for &quot;v.add(x)&quot; looks like.
I'm going to be writing at least 10 of these sorts of &quot;pattern 
replacements&quot; just for this BigDecimalRule
alone, and I refuse to get bogged down in mental images of ASTs.

So what I'm doing is write a tree-matching class that allows you to say
&quot;v + x --&gt; v.add(x)&quot; to mean &quot;look through an AST for a &quot;+&quot;
node with a first child that's an IDENT that has a particular text, and 
any arbitrary
second child. If found, replace that AST node with a different AST node
that has a METHOD_CALL node as its root, a DOT node as first child,
etc.&quot;

Humans think in terms of token streams, translators can go ahead and 
implement
the humans' wishes in terms of nicely structured trees.

I disagree. Object Oriented Design is, and always was, great, for 
example. Yet it languished in Smalltalk80 for all those years, and didn't
even really catch on completely with C++, and only became mainstream 
with Java. I myself didn't really &quot;get&quot; OO,
even using C++, until Java came along. It took a mix of a great idea 
*and* a good implementation for OO to become mainstream.

I think a tool can be great while being simple enough for most 
programmers (e.g. Java).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So don't dismiss tools because they're hard to grasp. My brother 
</I>&gt;<i> thought Emacs was a user-friendly disaster-area until he really needed 
</I>&gt;<i> a power-editor. Then he realised how friendly it really was ...
</I>
I'm not dismissing anything - just griping :)

I think Terence could make a huge leap forward by not thinking about 
ANTLR as &quot;a tool to automate what
a guru would have written by hand&quot;, but rather &quot;a tool that hides all 
the details of language manipulation, so that
most any programmer can do it&quot;. Most programmers use a compiler without 
ever knowing much more than
&quot;it generates some lower-level code from my code&quot;. Similarly, it would 
be nice if most programmers working on
language transformation could use ANTLR without knowing much more than 
&quot;it generates a lexer/parser from
my grammar&quot;.

I've been avoiding working on this bit of my grammar, but I'm starting
to need it now.

At what level should I attack the problem?

My first idea is to have an action at the point in the outer grammar
where the island grammar's start-marker is recognised, which will...

 1) take the unprocessed tail of the CommonTokenStream that the
    outer parser currently has as input, and turn back into a string
 2) create a new island lexer/TokenStream that reprocesses the tail
    from 1)
 3) create a parser for the island grammar, and parse the new token
    stream from 2)
 4) get the tail of the island grammar's token stream once the
    end-marker was found, and convert back to the lexer for 'this'
    grammar again
 5) replace the original 'input' reference the parser was using, and get
    going with the outer grammar again

If all that works, I can hook the AST built by the island grammar into
the AST that the outer grammar is creating.


How does that compare with the approach that others are taking?  Does it
sound like it might work, or is it wrong-headed and silly?


thanks!
dave

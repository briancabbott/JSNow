<PRE>&gt;<i> This is on applying rewrite rules for grammar transformation.  There 
</I>&gt;<i> has been quite a bit of research on rewriting, and it would be 
</I>&gt;<i> interesting to interface the BURG (bottom up rewrite 
</I>&gt;<i> generator)algorithm with ANTLR to do the &quot;match pattern and rewrite&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> approach to rule and tree transformation (as opposed to ANTLR's match 
</I>&gt;<i> rule and rewrite according to user annotations).
</I>
Antlr also does have some tree matching routines built in.  See the
implementations of the methods below in antlr.BaseAST
    public boolean equals(AST t);
    public boolean equalsList(AST t);
    public boolean equalsListPartial(AST t);
    public boolean equalsTree(AST t);
    public boolean equalsTreePartial(AST t);
    public ASTEnumeration findAll(AST tree);
    public ASTEnumeration findAllPartial(AST subtree);

I've not needed these for my projects but would be interested in hearing how
people use them.  

&gt;<i> BTW, I just received a letter that okays release of my rewriting 
</I>&gt;<i> support and tree grammar generation extensions under 
</I>&gt;<i> copyright.  Now I 
</I>&gt;<i> have to find out what else I need to do to actually release it, but I 
</I>&gt;<i> can hope for an early June release.  This is probably a good starting 
</I>&gt;<i> point for incorporating meta-level rewrite rules--the extensions 
</I>&gt;<i> generate a syntax tree for the output grammar from an input grammar.
</I>
That's great news!

&gt;<i> &gt; * Compilers
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a matter of interfacing to a backend.  An interesting 
</I>&gt;<i> start in 
</I>&gt;<i> this direction would be for someone to generate RTL from a 
</I>&gt;<i> transformed 
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR syntax tree.  Monty's GNU C grammar is much cleaner 
</I>&gt;<i> than the GNU 
</I>&gt;<i> C flex/bison (at least the gcc front end used to be a case of 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;abandon 
</I>&gt;<i> hope all ye who enter here&quot;--I haven't looked at the source since a 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.xx release) and an ANTLR C++ front end would be a major improvement.
</I>
It was pretty ugly.  I'm no YACC expert, so I gave up trying to deduce the
actual grammar from the flex/bison code.  I understand that David Wigg and
his group are porting it from Java to C++.  The Aspect C tool is being
written with it.  It's a source to source tool but should have some
interesting analysis and transformations going on in it.

 
&gt;<i> &gt; * Interpreters
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know of an interpreter written in ANTLR, although Ter has 
</I>&gt;<i> provided a few hooks for the purpose.  It would be 
</I>&gt;<i> interesting to hear 
</I>&gt;<i> of any experiences with ANTLR in this area.
</I>
Sinan has written a BASIC interpreter.  It's the tinybasic example in the
antlr distribution.

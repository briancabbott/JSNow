Hi,

I got the TokenStreamRewriteEngine working so that it just gives back the 
original string of what was parsed... 

Using the java.g grammar, what I would like to do now is delete the type 
specifier from a declaration statement:
&quot;int myInt = 7;&quot; =&gt; &quot;myInt = 7;&quot;

This should only be done when the declaration is a statement, and not when it 
is a class field for example...
So it should only apply for the rule:
statement
    :    (declaration)=&gt; declaration SEMI!

However, it seems that the rewriteEngine can only delete a range of tokens. 
SEMI is a token, but &quot;declaration&quot; is not so it seems (I guess its type is 
&quot;void&quot; since that's the return type of the declaration() method?). Still, I 
can't put the replace action where the type token is, because that's in the 
&quot;identifier&quot; rule, which would mean all identifiers would be deleted...

So is there a way I can &quot;navigate&quot; from &quot;declaration&quot; to the typeSpec and then 
to the identifier token in order to remove it?

Thanks in advance,

Hans

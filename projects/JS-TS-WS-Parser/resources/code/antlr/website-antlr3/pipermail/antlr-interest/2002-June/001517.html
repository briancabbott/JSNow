I'm not even worried about applying the operations to the original source -
the preprocessing itself is easy (it's already built). It's the graphing of
the preprocessing operations that I was wondering about, so your first
question is the right one. I don't want to use the graph in order to apply
the preprocessing, I only want to use the graph in order to analyze the
preprocessing.

Monty suggested a tree for each phase of the preprocessing, which may not
be practical (unless I misunderstand his idea), but it does make me wonder
if each phase of the operations in a preprocess graph could be made into
nodes on a tree.

I never grok these things without examples, so here's one. The language is
a 4GL called Progress. It's idea of #define looks like this:
  &amp;GLOBAL-DEFINE HI Hello World
And then the following displays &quot;Hello World&quot;:
  DISPLAY &quot;{&amp;HI}&quot;.
It gets ugly, because you can have a macro expand into another macro which
in turn gets expanded. Adding to the previous code:
  &amp;GLOBAL-DEFINE ARGH {&amp;HI}
And the &quot;Hello World&quot;:
  DISPLAY &quot;{&amp;ARGH}&quot;.

Perhaps each application of code substitution could be another node on the
graph? That would be a weird looking tree. Like Monty said, it's a headache.

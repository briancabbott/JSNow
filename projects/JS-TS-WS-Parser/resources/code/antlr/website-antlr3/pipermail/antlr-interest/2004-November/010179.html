</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hopefully, this is clearly written.  Regardless, it summarizes my

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, I'll try to be advocate of hetero-trees. :)
</I>
Using tree grammars has nothing to do with hetero vs homo trees.  i can 
parse both.  Hetero trees are only useful for when you want to 
manipulate them manually.

&gt;<i> The main point: if we have good description of heterohenous tree
</I>&gt;<i> we can generate all we need. In the article hetero-trees are considered
</I>&gt;<i> without tool support. Of course, manual maintenance of node classes is
</I>&gt;<i> difficult. But with proper tool you don't need to write get/set
</I>&gt;<i> methods for chilren and attributes, don't need to write additional 
</I>&gt;<i> checks.
</I>
ANTLR could generate classes just as you do, though I don't like the 
style of so many generated tree node types.

&gt;&gt;<i> 1. tree structure is not validated
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Visitor should not validate tree structure, because it is described 
</I>&gt;<i> separately
</I>&gt;<i> and checked during tree construction.
</I>
Are you sure?  Do you check for missing children with code?  No type 
system can check this for you as null is valid for any type. ;)

&gt;<i>  When tree structure is well-designed,
</I>&gt;<i> you can not create tree that doesn't correspond to syntactically 
</I>&gt;<i> correct input program.
</I>
Yes, that is nice (assuming the type system is up to it...only OO 
languages can get close).

&gt;<i> Btw, parser is not right place to check tree correctness because tree 
</I>&gt;<i> can be
</I>&gt;<i> constructed even without parser :) So, tree should be self-validating.
</I>
A nice feature, but you must walk the tree anyway, can we agree?  Might 
as well validate as you go; it's free once you have your TreeDL or my 
grammar.

&gt;&gt;<i> Node actions may compute data needed by future actions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Because each action is isolated (usually as a overridden method in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another class),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you cannot use the usual programming constructs like local variables, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parameters,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and return values to pass information. You must use instance 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> variables which are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clumsy and violate data hiding principles.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If data is related to node (for example, cross-references between 
</I>&gt;<i> references and
</I>&gt;<i> definition), it can be stored in [dynamic] attribute of that node.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know how to use local variables to pass info to other method :)
</I>&gt;<i> but parameters and return values can be used for visitors. At least in 
</I>&gt;<i> interface methods
</I>&gt;<i> - of course, between visit-methods parameters should be passed using 
</I>&gt;<i> visitor fields.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> class ActionVisitor
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>     // used by visit-methods
</I>&gt;<i>     Parameters parameters;
</I>&gt;<i>     // set by visit methods
</I>&gt;<i>     // can be used to simulate different return types
</I>&gt;<i>     ReturnValue returnValue;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     public ReturnValue process( Node node, Parameters parameters )
</I>&gt;<i>     {
</I>&gt;<i>         this.parameters = parameters;
</I>&gt;<i>         node.accept( this );
</I>&gt;<i>         return this.returnValue;
</I>&gt;<i>     }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     public void visit( SomeNode node )
</I>&gt;<i>     {
</I>&gt;<i>         // instead of return
</I>&gt;<i>         // unfortunately compiler can't check that all control paths
</I>&gt;<i>         // return value
</I>&gt;<i>         this.returnValue =
</I>&gt;<i>             // node and parameters can be used
</I>&gt;<i>             F( node, parameters );
</I>&gt;<i>     }
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not very good-looking, but it works. Better if it is generated
</I>&gt;<i> from some clear description like usual methods.
</I>
Yes, a mechanism could be built but a bit ugly as you say.  Remote 
attribution gives you lots of capabilities too.

&gt;<i> On the other hand hetero-trees allow easy access to child subtree.
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I know in tree grammar we have access only to entities
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned in current rule?
</I>
You must write code in a visitor to go to the children.  We use 
patterns (i.e., rule references) in antlr to do that.  Naturally we 
could use actions to go to the children manually ala visitors ;)

&gt;&gt;<i> Manual Tree Walkers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. manually built tree walkers have no guarantee that their parsing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> logic is complete and consistent
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The same is true for tree parsers - structure of tree built by parser
</I>&gt;<i> can differ from tree used in tree grammar.
</I>
Yeah, but the parser will say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, right?  Build what you 
want, then I parse it to check as I have to visit anyway each node.

&gt;&gt;<i> 3. manually building tree walkers is much more laborious than the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> visitor pattern
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Visiting and tree walking are independent things.
</I>&gt;<i> The main purpose of visitor pattern is implementation of &quot;external 
</I>&gt;<i> virtual methods&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> for tree nodes. Visitors can use different tree walking strateges (or 
</I>&gt;<i> don't use walking at all):
</I>
Yep.

&gt;<i> 1. Generated tree walker calls actions for each node. Actions called 
</I>&gt;<i> only from tree walker,
</I>&gt;<i> so only tree walker uses accept() methods of nodes to call correct 
</I>&gt;<i> walk() method of child node.
</I>&gt;<i> Class with action methods need not to implement visitor pattern.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this case tree walking doesn't require additional work - walker is 
</I>&gt;<i> generated.
</I>&gt;<i> But it is useful only in simple cases when actions can be called 
</I>&gt;<i> before/after subtree walking.
</I>&gt;<i> If you need action/walking mixture, you need manual tree walker (at 
</I>&gt;<i> least some methods overriden).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Manual tree walking using child.accept( this ) in visit methods.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, requires additional work and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. action and tree structure walking code is entangled; you risk 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> breaking action code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when altering the walking code
</I>&gt;<i> is true
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. There are special cases when manual tree walking doesn't require 
</I>&gt;<i> additional work.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, for codegeneration I use library that support such 
</I>&gt;<i> templates
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> class CodeGeneratorVisitor
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>     public void visitBinaryExpr( BinaryExpr node )
</I>&gt;<i>     {
</I>&gt;<i>         // template for output
</I>&gt;<i>         txt( &quot;${left} ${sign} ${right}&quot; );
</I>&gt;<i>     }
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> visit methods for parameters ${...} are called automatically in 
</I>&gt;<i> library method txt().
</I>&gt;<i> (I know, there is drawback - patterns can not be checked at 
</I>&gt;<i> compile-time, will try
</I>&gt;<i> to improve code generation library in the future)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the last case is the hint of what should be a source for 
</I>&gt;<i> visitor generation
</I>&gt;<i> - I repeat, description should be clear from implementation details,
</I>&gt;<i> only what we want to express.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example, how do you express that a child can be optional?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> node PlusNode : ExprNode
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>     child ExprNode left;
</I>&gt;<i>     child ExprNode? right;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In TreeDL types don't allow null value implicitly. You need to write 
</I>&gt;<i> '?' that means 'optional'
</I>&gt;<i> as in BNF notation. As far as I remember in some specification 
</I>&gt;<i> languages (VDM)
</I>&gt;<i> type [T] means 'value of type T or null'. May be if it would be used 
</I>&gt;<i> in programming languages,
</I>&gt;<i> NullPointerException would be rare.
</I>&gt;<i> Damn, I need to improve my English :) Hope, you can understand me, but 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm
</I>&gt;<i> sure there is grammatical error.
</I>
Your English is great!

So, you generate code in the constructor to validate that the correct 
pointers are null / not-null?  That is good and is required.

&gt;&gt;<i> he says that his manually developed Java tree has about 150 nodes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regardless, you are still looking at lots of files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, I'm looking at single file with tree description. :)
</I>
That is true.  Do you ever look at the generated classes though?  You 
talk about manually setting/getting/building etc...  If you never look 
at the output, all is well and i'll change the article ;)

&gt;<i> It has about 1200 lines with some comments.
</I>&gt;<i> Parser is about three times longer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Errata:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enapsulating
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; encapsulating
</I>
oops.

&gt;&gt;<i> For example, why look in n files for n different statement node types?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All StatementList can show is, at most, a typed list: 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> List&lt;StatementNode&gt;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It says absolutely nothing about what the statements are--the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subclasses
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of StatementNode seem a rather weak and indirect method for specifying
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such a close relationship.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You cannot list the expression tree types; one must find all 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subclasses of ExprNode.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> HTML documentation can be generated from TreeDL tree description
</I>&gt;<i> with cross-references between node type and all inherited node types.
</I>
Yes, but what you have is not a grammar unless it explicitly shows the 
possible subtrees.  Why use implicit rather than explicit 
specification.  You are so close to a grammar!  I think the summary is 
that you generate types and I generate methods and I allow actions in 
the grammar rather than visitors. ;)

&gt;&gt;<i> Not only is the tree grammar more explicit (i.e., you are saying 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exactly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what you mean rather than co-opting a type system),
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I mentioned in one of previous messages, it seems that tree grammar 
</I>&gt;<i> and tree description
</I>&gt;<i> are almost equivalent.
</I>
Almost ;)

&gt;&gt;<i> it is smaller,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Than what? Than generated from tree description Java files? Of course.
</I>&gt;<i> Tree description itself also is longer but mainly because it is 
</I>&gt;<i> written line-per-child
</I>&gt;<i> and uses longer keywords :) But I believe TreeDL is more readable 
</I>&gt;<i> (especially
</I>&gt;<i> for newbies) than ANTLR tree grammar (without actions, but with labels 
</I>&gt;<i> for subrules).
</I>
Perhaps as they are more familiar with fields than grammars.

&gt;&gt;<i> it is completely self-contained
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The same is true for TreeDL tree description.
</I>
Minus the fact that stmt node does not list the statements, I might 
agree. ;)

&gt;&gt;<i> and formally guarantees tree structure
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, it's true for TreeDL. But TreeDL checks trees during 
</I>&gt;<i> construction,
</I>&gt;<i> not during processing.
</I>
Correct.  A nice feature.

&gt;<i> Btw, repeating tree grammar when writing each action in some sence is 
</I>&gt;<i> like
</I>&gt;<i> repeating a class declaration in each method that process objects of 
</I>&gt;<i> this class :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (as opposed to hand-written walk() methods that might forget to walk 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> down
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one of the children).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But not for generated walkers. And when actions are written manually,
</I>&gt;<i> missing of some child walking usually cause missing action.
</I>&gt;<i> In tree grammar also is possible to miss action.
</I>
Not a parsing action, just a user action.

&gt;<i> So, chances are similar. :)
</I>
more likely that a programmer will screw up the parser than their 
actions within a grammar otherwise we'd not use parser generators ;)

&gt;&gt;<i> I should also point out that Loring Craymer has a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> means of automatically generating tree grammars from the text parser 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grammar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that builds trees (to be released in the 2.8 experimental release).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds interesting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Context Information
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm also not very happy with visitors. But the way of passing context 
</I>&gt;<i> information
</I>&gt;<i> can be used not only with ANTLR tree grammars. Some notation can be 
</I>&gt;<i> used as source
</I>&gt;<i> for specification of actions over tree. It can be similar to tree 
</I>&gt;<i> grammar in part of
</I>&gt;<i> context information handling, but don't need to describe full tree 
</I>&gt;<i> structure
</I>&gt;<i> because it is described separately. And from it we can generate 
</I>&gt;<i> visitors or what else we need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some time ago, I played with preprocessor that generates visitors from 
</I>&gt;<i> something like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> node SomeNode
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>     visit Visitor1
</I>&gt;<i>     {
</I>&gt;<i>         for( int i = 0; i &lt; $#childList; i++ )
</I>&gt;<i>         {
</I>&gt;<i>             F( $childList[i] )
</I>&gt;<i>         }
</I>&gt;<i>     }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     visit Visitor2
</I>&gt;<i>     {
</I>&gt;<i>         anotherNode.$childOfAnotherNode
</I>&gt;<i>     }
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> visit() methods are grouped by node, like methods. And children can be 
</I>&gt;<i> referenced using $childName
</I>&gt;<i> shorthand notation because I hate Java long getChildName() and like C# 
</I>&gt;<i> properties.
</I>
That is good and is equiv to grammars + actions, right? :)

&gt;<i> May be now it is time to remember this tool and rethink what should be 
</I>&gt;<i> a source
</I>&gt;<i> and what should be generated. I'm inspired by tree grammars :)
</I>
Hooray!  Soon we will agree completely minus what the generated code 
looks like :)

&gt;&gt;<i> Multiple Tree Grammars
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> According to my experience, cut/paste without tool support causes 
</I>&gt;<i> many-many errors.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Text editor in skilful hands - an awful weapon&quot; :)
</I>
;)

&gt;<i> In any case, tree grammars and descriptions - are two approaches to 
</I>&gt;<i> the same problem.
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that both are powerful enough, both have drawbacks and both 
</I>&gt;<i> can be significantly improved.
</I>&gt;<i> May be it will make compiler construction even easier than today :)
</I>
Let's hope!

Thanks for the great discussion.

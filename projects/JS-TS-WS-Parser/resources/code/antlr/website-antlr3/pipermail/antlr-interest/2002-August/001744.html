Well you have to go about it in a different way than in flex.

I don't quite see this.

I seem to have given a wrong impression, you can safely ignore parts of the
input (have a look at the preserveWhiteSpace example for example). Even a
multiplexed lexer need not return a token, when it is switched to/from.

&gt;<i> Perhaps some trick of finding a token, marking the location, finding the
</I>&gt;<i> next token, and processing the data between the two as a string...?
</I>
Well this is what you can do with tokenstream multiplexing. You see the
token, you switch to another lexer untill the endmarker then you switch
back. Inside the special lexer for the part between the markers you can do
whatever you want with it. e.g. accumulate in a string, just ignore it,
feed it to something else.

You can also make a custom Lexer just subclass from the TokenStream class
and multiplex it like any other lexer. That way you can handcode something
for performance.

The one thing you have to keep in mind is that all the lexers operating on
the input should share the same LexerInputState (or LexerSharedInputState
to be precise). This structure is used to keep track the InputBuffer that
is attached to your input data and it keeps track of when the lexer is
using backtracking to solve a ambiguity and also the line/column
information is kept inside it.

Going around the lexer input state will of course yield funny but probably
very 'interesting' behaviour.

Maybe have a look at the doxygen info of the C++ support library you can
find a preliminary version on my antlr hacking page:

<A HREF="http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/antlr/">http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/antlr/</A>

Or read through the code, see how the lexers work, keywords: InputBuffer,
LexerSharedInputState, CharScanner (consume/LA). Read the code generated
for a few lexers (preferably a few that use backtracking). That way you'll
easily get a feel for how it works.

HTH,

Ric

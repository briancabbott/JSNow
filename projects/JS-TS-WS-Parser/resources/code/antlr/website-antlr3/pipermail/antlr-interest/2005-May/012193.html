Actually, there are 2 reasons I want to try ANTLR:

1) My grammar has recently got more complex and, for the first time, I 
need to add an AST to check one of the new constructs;

2) I've always had niggling problems with the single-token lookahead on 
lex/yacc, but I can more or less live with those.

So, I figured it would be simpler to learn ANTLR than to write my own 
tree-processing code, and I could get the lookahead as a bonus.

Thanks - I'll give them a go.

&gt;<i> Also note that the 3.0 version will have all that tree stuff cleaned  up 
</I>&gt;<i> and documented (hopefully in a nice book).
</I>
Sounds like you're missing a trick here. If I was getting 5K 
downloads/month, then I'd take a couple of months off, finish the book, 
and order myself a new yacht.  :)

<PRE>Yesterday I tried Antlr. The initial motivation was to translate my Java
code into C++. There is a very nice and clean Java 5 grammar with Antlr
3b6 &lt;<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/grammar/1152141644268/java.g">http://www.antlr.org/grammar/1152141644268/java.g</A>&gt;  (other Java
grammars for antlr 2.7.X
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/grammar/1090713067533/index.html">http://www.antlr.org/grammar/1090713067533/index.html</A>&gt;  ). I can parse
any Java source tree. But apparently no one has written a translator on
top of the Java 5 grammar . Of course there is some work to do, but
certainly less than the translation from C++ to Java; see comparing c++
and java
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.javacoffeebreak.com/articles/thinkinginjava/comparingc++andj">http://www.javacoffeebreak.com/articles/thinkinginjava/comparingc++andj</A>
ava.html&gt;  for a list of differences. I don't expect a full translation
at first, I would be satisfied by something translating over 95% of the
syntax, leaving 5% to correct manually.

I don't know yet how to implement the translator:

*	use Tree construction (rewrite rules) as explained in 

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Tree+construction">http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Tree+construction</A>

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/doc/trees.html#_bb1">http://www.antlr.org/doc/trees.html#_bb1</A>

*	traverse the Abstract Syntax tree in Java and directly output
what I want 
*	use stringtemplate &lt;<A HREF="http://www.stringtemplate.org/">http://www.stringtemplate.org/</A>&gt;  , which
seems well integrated with Antlr, having the same author . 

In fact in first approximation, neglecting the .h files, a C++ class is
very similar to a Java class with some local changes (like replacing
&quot;extends&quot; by &quot;:&quot; ) or less local changes, like:

A a = new A(); ===&gt; A* a = new A();

Is it possible to start from a verbatim recursive template, then adding
rules incrementally, like is often done in XSLT ? In fact I'd be
interested to read about comparison of concepts between Antlr and XSLT.

Or wouldn't it be possible to use the multi-language layer that is
inside Antlr and which allows Antlr to generate parsers in several
languages like Java, C++, C# ?

Among the questions I have is this one. Which is the best way to keep
the grammar definition separate from the different uses of that grammar
? Like reusing the pure Java 5 grammar for 1) a translator to C++ , 2) a
Java code quality checker , 3) a pattern recognizer for design patterns
, etc . 

I have to confess that I'm new to Antlr, although I collaborated to
eXist &lt;<A HREF="http://exist-db.org/">http://exist-db.org/</A>&gt;  , which has an Antlr grammar for XQuery. I
already wrote a non-trivial flex-bison parser and lots of XSLT.

Megan,

In my suggested solution, the nextToken() method in the subclass hides
the existing method, it can't override it. 

The explicit implementation of the method for the TokenStream
interface is important though. That is how the Parser regards the
Lexer - as a TokenStream.

Now I've thought about it, you might just be coming up against issues
that arise where nextToken() is invoked within the underlying Lexer
and CharScanner classes. Any such invocation would obviously used the
existing, unoverridable method.

Cheers,

Micheal

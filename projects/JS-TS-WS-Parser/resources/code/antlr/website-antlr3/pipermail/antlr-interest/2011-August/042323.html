<PRE>By 'stable', do you mean, 'it's not updated very often', or 'there are 
not many bugs'? I'm guessing you meant the former.
Also, what exactly do you mean by an 'ANTLR appliance'?

I've used ANTLR IDE, and found it to be very good. I much prefer it to 
ANTLRWorks. (Although I do still use ANTLRWork's debugging 
functionality; ANTLR IDE seems to require you to put in breakpoints 
everywhere in your grammar if you want to be able to (meaningfully) 
debug your grammar). It seems pretty stable in terms of its 
'bug-freeness'. Looking at the website, 
<A HREF="http://antlrv3ide.sourceforge.net/,">http://antlrv3ide.sourceforge.net/,</A> it also seems that the plug-in has 
not been updated for half a year or so. Looks like there were about 5 or 
so updates over 2010, whilst there's not been any yet this year. 
Therefore you could infer that it's becoming more stable (either because 
it does not need updates or because the developer is not actively 
working on it at the moment).

As for ANTLR DT, I don't know anything about it.

You might find better (i.e. more official) answers on these things by 
searching for posts on this mailing list which refer to ANTLR IDE or 
AntlrDT (using Google). There might be posts by the plug-in writers 
themselves.

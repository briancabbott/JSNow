Sorry for my error.

You are correct. Mutual left recursion is a (possibly indirect) cycle.

For some reason I mis-read your question and was responding to removing 
ambiguity by finding common left prefixes. Which was not your question 
and may not be a problem with these particular rules.

Sorry for the noise.

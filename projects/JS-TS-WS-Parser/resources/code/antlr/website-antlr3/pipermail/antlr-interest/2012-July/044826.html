<PRE>Hi Jim,

thanks for your quick reply, and sorry for my being late.

I proceeded as you recommended and found that the parser output of C
and Java is equivalent for the offending input, so the parser is not
to blame. Upon debugging the code step by step I found that the tree
parser descends alright into the AST from the parser. The error occurs
when it finds a DOWN node where it expects an UP node while processing
the wildcard portion of a rule.

Apparently, for the C runtime, a wildcard does not represent a tree
but only a single node.
(I remember finding a discussion about this somewhere else on this
list, where I believe the resolution was that it should represent a
tree, right?)

My question now is this: How to specify a rule that accepts any
sequence of sub-trees on a given node?

For example:

^(MY_NODE .*)

Here, the . shall represent a sub-tree of arbitrary depth, and the
star shall indicate that there may be any number of sub-trees on
MY_NODE. Is there a way to specify this behavior in a tree grammar
without having to spell out all possible sub-trees explicitly?

Thanks again for your help!

Martin

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [antlr-interest] Tree grammar generated for the C runtime reports a
</I>&gt;<i> syntax error where Java doesn't
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dear everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am currently developing a simple grammar for a regex-like language that
</I>&gt;<i> involves a tree grammar. When I debug the tree grammar in Java using
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLRworks it seems to work fine. However, once I generate C code, some
</I>&gt;<i> inputs would fail reporting the syntax error:
</I>&gt;<i>     -unknown source-(0)  : error 1 : Unexpected node, at offset 0, near DOWN
</I>&gt;<i> : syntax error...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This might hint at a bug in the C runtime, though I'm not entirely sure
</I>&gt;<i> about that. Anyway, since I'm at my wits end about this, I was wondering
</I>&gt;<i> whether one of you can help me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Attached you will find the grammars, their generated C code, and a text rig.
</I>&gt;<i> I am using the latest stable release ANTLRworks 1.4.3 and the latest C
</I>&gt;<i> runtime libantlr3c-3.4.tar.gz, compiled with the 64 bit flag.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Clues:
</I>&gt;<i> - The offending input is as simple as &quot;[a]&quot; (excluding the quotes).
</I>&gt;<i> - The input &quot;[?]&quot; works, the only difference being that the question mark is
</I>&gt;<i> a single node in the tree grammar whereas other possibilities may have an
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary number of sub-trees, as indicated by the wildcards.
</I>&gt;<i> - The grammar distinguishes between bracketed expressions that involve a
</I>&gt;<i> whitespace and those that don't. Again, the input &quot;[a b]&quot; fails in C, but
</I>&gt;<i> not in Java.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be very happy if anyone would help me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Martin
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS: On a minor note, when regenerating the C code from the grammars you will
</I>&gt;<i> notice that RegexWord.c won't compile because one function contains a line
</I>&gt;<i> referring to a variable &quot;stream_&quot; that should be &quot;stream_unit2&quot; in my case.
</I>&gt;<i> This is a known bug, and after changing the variable name as indicated, the
</I>&gt;<i> generated code compiles.

The difference is *few 100 microseconds* for even 10000 virtual function  
calls. See for yourself in this benchmark (makes 1 billion calls). Run the  
jvm both with and without &quot;-server&quot; option.

&gt;<i> Hi,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In any case you've omitted the per-character call for col/offset  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tracking.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We were discussing line/col/offset counting not just newlines.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, the offset gets tracked anyway, as ANTLR is going through a String
</I>&gt;<i> where it has to track the input position anyways. That value is IIRC
</I>&gt;<i> also accessible (or could be made accessible very easily).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is left is line breaks. How would you imagine ANTLR Lexers do that
</I>&gt;<i> more efficiently? E.g. always checking if the next character(s) is a \r
</I>&gt;<i> \n, \n or \r? What about users that want \0 to be their line separator?
</I>&gt;<i> Or users that don't want that at all?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If the lexer was built to do it properly, there would be no function  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> calls
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The overhead of a function call on x86 is very low. Plus, your compiler
</I>&gt;<i> might decide to inline, at least in managed languages, as said. For C++
</I>&gt;<i> a no-virtual-method-needed way via templates has been discussed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I don't know what you're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; doing with the 4000 lines you have parsed in the same time,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; but are 4000 de-refs really significant compared to stepping
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; through the parsing rules for 4000 lines of code and building the AST?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Lexers don't build ASTs. The per-char calls needed for line/col/offset
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tracking would definitely hurt lexer performance if the counts were  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tacked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on via overridden methods.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only thing that is (currently) done using an overridden method is
</I>&gt;<i> the newline thing, isn't it? A per character virtual method call would
</I>&gt;<i> be ugly, that's true.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are you using the Lexer standalone? Even in that case I'd wonder if it
</I>&gt;<i> really makes a difference. For each character you have at least one
</I>&gt;<i> switch, you have the testing of alternatives etc. Will a virtual method
</I>&gt;<i> call for every ~20 characters make a difference bigger than maybe 1%? I
</I>&gt;<i> think there are more important places where ANTLR could - and is - be
</I>&gt;<i> enhanced, e.g. the String copying thing or various things in the C++
</I>&gt;<i> part that have been discussed countless times on this list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not generally arguing against including something like that, but
</I>&gt;<i> you'd have to find a very flexible way to do so. Otherwise users will be
</I>&gt;<i> unhappy because it doesn't match what they want to have, and their
</I>&gt;<i> solution might get more complex.

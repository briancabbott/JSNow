(Er, gimme a sec whilst I put on my bullet-proof jacket here...)

BETTER MSVC INTEGRATION SUPPORT.  *ducks the rocks*  I know we all 
hate M$, and I'm no exception.  But for the love of god, there's a 
LOT of development going on in MSVC these days, and ignoring the poor 
saps (like me) who have to use it is not so nice.  Basically, we need 
for ANTLR to be truly platform agnostic, not just *nix agnostic.

To whit:
* NMAKE-compatible makefiles for the C++ libs.  If we can cobble up 
NMAKE makefiles, then we're cool with Ric--we're purely command-
line.  I got no problem with that, since if you can make an NMAKE 
file, you can make a GUI project for it.

* Has anyone mentioned smoke testing of builds yet?  If that's 
already happening, let's get MSVC as a test target for the C++ libs.

* A warning-free build for the C++ libs, for all major targets.  A 
Windows build is still littered with warnings all over the place.

* Let's get multiple error reporting formats.  Make them command-line 
selectable.  MSVC mandates a specific format for error output from 
external commands in order to integrate them fully into the 
environment (eg. being able to double-click an ANTLR error in the 
output window and it taking you to the offending line in your grammar 
file).

I hope I haven't repeated anoyone else's thoughts here.

Steve

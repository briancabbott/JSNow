<PRE> 
I ran into this accidentally.  I cut some stuff out of a PDF file for
testing and 
though the text looked perfectly fine in the editor I had trouble lexing
some 
characters.  After a bit of head scratching I started guessing the where
the 
lexer would stop were ASCII characters other that looked the same but
were 
different.  I thought maybe I should allow those characters and as I
attempted 
to use them I ran into a brick wall.

Strange how you find some issue.

Excellent thought!!

I haven't heard from any programming language to allow other quotation
marks than ' and &quot;. To allow those Microsoft replacements may be a
disfavor to your users, once they switch to other systems.

<PRE>Not sure what dependencies you are referring to.

But, in any case, if the rule in question is being decomposed purely for 
syntactic distinction, you wind up with multiple additional objects with 
decision points for evaluation all for no semantic gain (at least with 
respect to an ideal parse tree that maintains order).  The work to split 
a rule for semantic distinction purposes I would accept as a requirement.

</I>&gt;<i> I strongly disagree with your statement about decomposition complexity. I use an annotation processor to statically validate code (classes, fields, methods) that depends on the shape of my parse tree (or any subset of it). The grammar used by GoWorks has 126 context classes, with 670 dependencies throughout the code base. If 2 smaller rules get combined, then instead of having separate dependencies for the two rules the affected code will all share a dependency, which doubles my work if I need to make a future change to just 1 of the two smaller rules.

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, its that &quot;in the order they were parsed&quot; that is the issue. That would imply a list of lists per context to preserve ordering. Kinda what I was hoping for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem with rule decomposition is that it non-trivially increases the complexity of processing the parse tree.  For example, the Java grammar is less than about 30 rules.  Yet the number of distinct contexts, factoring in decomposition and use of the # alt rule markers (including refactoring to ensure that the alts marked are all outer), is very nearly 200.  Not a desirable direction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the rules that I presented, the elements are all terminals, so examining the token stream is just a single look back.  Changing the lexer to produce Identifier : DotIdentifier | HashIdentifier ; tokens would also work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A more general solution would require a token to keep a reference to its enclosing scope, including its prior peer element and its closure.
</I>&gt;<i> Should be able to do that using custom tokens and actions to explicitly capture scope state in the initial parse.  Any reason this approach would not work/would not be desirable?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In V3, a rewrite with multiple root operators behaves like individual rules in v4's parse trees. While the nodes in an AST produced by a V3 rule can have a complicated shape, the node created for a V4 rule is always a single node for the rule with a flat list of children (rule contexts and terminals) in the order they were parsed. Rule decomposition is the way to give your trees the shape you want, and really shouldn't cause a performance problem in v4.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, and that is the work around I am using now.  Sorry if I was not clear.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Resorting to rule decomposition unfortunately greatly increases the number of enter/exits and the depth of what was, in v3, AST rewrites.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Was hoping I was missing some way to mark or label the rule elements to remove the ambiguity.

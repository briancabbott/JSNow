<PRE>Hi George,

I'm providing AST construction and tree grammars for advanced users and for backward compatibility. I have done some tree rewriters for the book, yes, but I have found that they work well only for such things as peephole optimization.   The AST/ tree grammar mechanism also is something I've been pushing for 20 years without success.  I started out in the compilers world where you really do need an AST, to avoid all of the noise of rule names inside your tree. Recently I had the chance to reevaluate and try out a simple new mechanism based upon parse trees, which can be automatically generated. Now, I'm doing both a DOM and a SAX event type model, which is suitable for lots of different applications. For example, if you want to collect information about all Java declarations, you can simply pass in a listener to the Java parser. The parser doesn't have to be one that happens to have AST construction rules.

Anyway, this is just a taste of what I've been thinking about and it definitely seems to fit within the marketplace / common tasks better. While v4 will have lots of great new features, if you have something working with v3, I'm not sure there is a huge reason to convert. v4 is a lot easier to build grammars and simpler to use in terms of language application implementation, but if you already have a grammar that works, It's probably not worth the effort to try to upgrade. In the case of tree rewriting grammars, if they work, I would just leave them in v3. You will be able to mix the two (v3, v4) freely given the different package names.

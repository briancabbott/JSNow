<PRE>Jim - thanks for the quick response. I would note a couple of things: 
first, &quot;merging&quot; the tokens at the lexer stage seems to be an 
effective and indeed necessary technique to accomodate the &quot;grouping&quot; 
notation in the XQuery 1.0 grammar. i.e. in some parser rule, there 
might be a reference to (to use my prior example for continuity):

... &lt; TOKEN1 TOKEN2 &gt; ...

in the XQuery grammar, denoting that TOKEN1 and TOKEN2 are to be 
effectively treated as one unit. I think this is done in order to 
preserve the grammar as LL(1) parsable. ANTLR itself doesn't (unless 
I'm missing it) have such an ability (and sub-rules grouping in 
parentheses are not equivalent apparently), other than to define 
another lexer rule as my example gave:

MULTIPLE: TOKEN1 TOKEN2;

and then up in the parser rules, &lt; TOKEN TOKEN2 &gt; can be replaced 
with MULTIPLE.  This appears to work as expected. (Concrete examples 
are 'DECLARE boundary-space' vs. 'DECLARE default' vs. 'DECLARE 
namespace' etc. - unless you lex each one as single units, the parser 
needs LL(2) to distinguish between them. Correct me if I'm wrong 
here. Yes, I understand that ANTLR 3.0 is LL(*) and can backtrack but 
I want to keep this LL(1), as intended by the official grammar.)

I'm actually more concerned about my first examples with the 
character ranges, than the &quot;merging&quot; idea, though for completeness I 
wanted to include it in my question.

</PRE>

</I>&gt;<i> in discussing whether we might see some changes in ANTLR in the future 
</I>&gt;<i> to address these issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With C#, Java and C++ current supported by ANTLR (and Python on the 
</I>&gt;<i> way?), it seems to me that ANTLR has the great advantage of being a 
</I>&gt;<i> language agnostic tool.  I applaud this.  However, it stops just short 
</I>&gt;<i> of being truly language independent which is a shame.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To give you some background, I have developed a 
</I>&gt;<i> lexer+parser+treewalker.  I'm quite pleased by the fact that the 
</I>&gt;<i> entire arrangement is *NEARLY* language independent.  This is really a 
</I>&gt;<i> shame because it seems to me that it could be made completely language 
</I>&gt;<i> neutral.  To me, there are only three real issues.  The first one may 
</I>&gt;<i> have a solution, the second one seems like it could be addressed 
</I>&gt;<i> easily but the third one (quite deliberately if I'm not mistaken) 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have a current workaround:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) My first problem is that in the language I'm interested in 
</I>&gt;<i> (Modelica), has some rules that are somewhat complicated.  Suffice it 
</I>&gt;<i> to say that I have several optional qualifiers that appear at the 
</I>&gt;<i> start of the rule and I want them as the last children of that AST.  
</I>&gt;<i> So, I use the &quot;!&quot; to suppress automatically including them and then I 
</I>&gt;<i> add a statement like &quot;#cd1-&gt;addChild(#f)&quot; or &quot;#cd1.addChild(#f)&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> depending on whether I am using C++ or Java, respectively.  
</I>&gt;<i> Admittedly, I might be able to avoid this particular manipulation of 
</I>&gt;<i> the tree but it would be nice (and perhaps I'm just not aware) if a 
</I>&gt;<i> language-neutral way existed for this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) In my lexer, I have a similar problem.  I need to process comments 
</I>&gt;<i> and dump whitespace.  If I understand this correctly, this is 
</I>&gt;<i> typically done like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WS
</I>&gt;<i>     : (' '
</I>&gt;<i>         | '\t'
</I>&gt;<i>         | '\n' { newline(); }
</I>&gt;<i>         | '\r')
</I>&gt;<i>         {
</I>&gt;<i> //            _ttype = antlr::Token::SKIP;
</I>&gt;<i>             _ttype = Token.SKIP;
</I>&gt;<i>         }
</I>
Actually $setType(Token.SKIP) is the &quot;right&quot; way ;)

&gt;<i>     ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once again, a slightly different syntax is required depending on 
</I>&gt;<i> whether this is C++ or Java (or C# or Python, etc).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) This is the more significant (and in my opinion, downright silly) 
</I>&gt;<i> obstacle to achieving language independence.  My grammar file starts 
</I>&gt;<i> with:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> options {
</I>&gt;<i>     language = &quot;Cpp&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why oh why am I prohibited from making this a command line option?  I 
</I>&gt;<i> know this was discussed before, but I never understood the evil of 
</I>&gt;<i> command-line options.  Perhaps there is a reason why associated the 
</I>&gt;<i> language with the grammar would be useful (when the grammar/treewalker 
</I>&gt;<i> includes actions for example).  But mine are (or could be made) 
</I>&gt;<i> essentially language neutral except for this one line!?!?!
</I>
If there are no actions then no problem: cmd-line would work.  Rarely 
do you have no actions, however, and the {...} must be handled in a 
language sensitive way :)

&gt;<i> How about a compromise.  Keep the &quot;language = ...&quot; option, but allow 
</I>&gt;<i> the *default language* to be controlled from the command line.  Then 
</I>&gt;<i> you do not lose or exchange this functionality, you merely augment 
</I>&gt;<i> it?!?  Can we agree to that?
</I>
What do you do about actions?

&gt;<i> If these issues are resolved, I will be at peace with my &quot;.g&quot; files 
</I>&gt;<i> because I won't feel like I have needlessly over-constrained their &gt; use.
</I>
Perhaps just building trees is the answer...that is language 
independent :)

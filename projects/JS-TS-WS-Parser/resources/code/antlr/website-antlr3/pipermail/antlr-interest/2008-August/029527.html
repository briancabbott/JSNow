It appears that antlr gathers all the tokens up front, before any parser rules have been processed, so you may not be able to alter the actual tokens generated with a 'state'. 

But it's fairly straightforward to use the grammar to recognize only certain keywords in different contexts. Just have different lists of modifiers

	func_mods : STATIC | ...
	classvar_mods: PRIVATE | ...

and reference the each one in the correct context.

Recognizing a constructor will take a different approach. There is some discussion of using runtime information like that in the DAR (Definitive Antlr Reference). One way would be to keep track of the current class being parsed and preface the constructor rule with a test to check if the name of the current function matches the enclosing class name. You can create your own symbol table to do this, or possibly use the built-in dynamic scoping mechanism (also discussed in the book).

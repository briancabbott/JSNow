Yes, but there is no practical way to fit it into one page.  Chapter, 
maybe; more likely a book.

</I>
Unfortunately, that is the nature of the beast.  Grammars are highly 
custom and if you don't have a good grasp of the full set of 
requirements at the outset, trying to tack on things at the end can 
really bork the whole design -- most of the time you can, but 
sometimes the change requirement trickles down to requiring a change 
in token definitions -- and that is very frustrating.

And, if there is a #16, it would be:
16) Don't try to do too much in actions; just call a method.  Any 
standard programming language is far better at procedural logic.

&gt;&gt;<i>11) Unless performance is absolutely your top 6 design 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>requirements, don't worry about using predicates.
</I>&gt;<i>that would be &quot;don't worry about what predicates /cost/&quot;?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;&gt;<i>14) Don't try to dump complex blocks from a parser or AST.  Use 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>StringTemplate to unparse.
</I>&gt;<i>Does this hold if the final output is not a text file (e.g. in 
</I>&gt;<i>memory structures or a binary data file)
</I>
No and maybe.  Would be an interesting application to have 
StringTemplate operate as a directed byte code generator.

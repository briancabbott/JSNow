<PRE>&gt;<i> This reminds me of another issue.  It seems to me (again, I'm probably
</I>&gt;<i> missing something) that the tree grammar stuff makes reuse difficult.
</I>&gt;<i> I imagine the &quot;correct way&quot; to do things is to define a complete tree
</I>&gt;<i> grammar and then extend it for different applications.  In this way,
</I>&gt;<i> you can override some of the rules (only the ones you are interested
</I>&gt;<i> in).  But, don't you have to rewrite the entire rule?  If so, that
</I>&gt;<i> seems like a real pain if you are likely to establish actions for all
</I>&gt;<i> rules because you end up re-typing the whole grammar anyway.  I'm
</I>&gt;<i> comparing this to something like a &quot;visitor&quot; approach where you can
</I>&gt;<i> just write the action and the rule it is associated with.  Am I
</I>&gt;<i> missing something?  Also, it seems like every application considerably
</I>&gt;<i> complicates my Makefile because I have to establish lots of new
</I>&gt;<i> targets for the generated code from each tree grammar.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>
I assume you are talking about &quot;grammar subclassing&quot; here.  Yes, the
unit of work in a tree grammar is a rule, it's really difficult to
come up with a specification that lets you tell where to insert code
into an existing rule.  Ultimately we will have an editor that
supports such reuse so you can do a smart copy &amp; paste that will warn
you when the superclass grammar has changed and yours hasn't.  I agree
about the Makefile.  I have written a Makefile generator for antlr
(java), but it should be pretty easy to extend for C++.  See

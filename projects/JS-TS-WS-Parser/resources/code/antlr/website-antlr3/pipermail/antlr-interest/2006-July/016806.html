Hi...thank gawd somebody is fixing that ridiculously bad parser in  
lucene!!!!!

i've only got a few seconds, but sounds to me like you really need a  
sem pred and oddly enough left recursion

expr : {something smart here}? expr '/' INT expr
        | term
        ;

that predicate will need to look past a term and see the next  
operator.  For examle

A /2 B /1 C

the pred should scan past A as LA(1) and see the operator value.  I  
did a trick with recursion levels to do left recursion 10 years ago  
but can't remember.  seems with unfixed priority levels this could be  
bad actually.  ok nevermind.

Try building a data structure that tracks the list of operators  
(tracking operands) and then sorts them.  *then* build a tree quickly  
from the operands pointed to by the operators.  Might be simpler than  
transforming a tree.

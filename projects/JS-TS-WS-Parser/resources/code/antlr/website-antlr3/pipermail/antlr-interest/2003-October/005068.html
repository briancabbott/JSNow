<PRE>Hi,

Think it was upped to 8 bit at a point. The documentation is crappy though.

&gt;<i> Then, somewhere along the way, the expected character becomes an int,

Hmm I had expected a problem like this one of these days. The runtime uses
a lot of int's where it should be using unsigneds just to prevent these
signextension troubles. I started changing some of them already only this
part I did not touch yet.

&gt;<i> I guess this is partly my fault since I didn't follow ANTLR's
</I>&gt;<i> documentation carefully enough. Changing the rule to
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> STADVAER	:	&quot;sta\360v\346r&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to fix this (it's butt-ugly though :o). However, I would like to
</I>&gt;<i> point out that this worked in Java, with it's multibyte string
</I>&gt;<i> constants, and along they way, antlr.Tool never complained about it's
</I>&gt;<i> input.
</I>
antlr.Tool often does not complain where it should ;) To get back to the
point I thought I had fixed all these quoting stuffs in C++ codegen. Seems
I'll have to reinvestigate.

&gt;<i> I'm sending this in here mostly to be of reference to others lexing
</I>&gt;<i> non-7bit ascii data with a c++ lexer, in case the hit the same walls I
</I>&gt;<i> did.
</I>
8 bit should work fine except for some caveats. I will look at this.
Multibyte encodings is a no go though in C++.

Cheers,

Ric

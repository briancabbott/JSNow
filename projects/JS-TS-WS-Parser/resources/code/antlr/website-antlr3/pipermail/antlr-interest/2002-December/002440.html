<PRE>hi there,

i am currently developing a small language in C++, where the parser 
is generated by antlr, and the commands are my classes which are 
based on the BaseAST. since these are small programs in a distributed 
environment, i need to get the generated trees serialized. is there 
anybody who did something like this and would be ready to share 
experiences with me?

i must add, that i am trying to avoid altering the base classes which 
are delivered with antlr. this would make it difficult for me to keep 
with the newer versions of antlr. perhaps this could be included in 
the base classes as an extension? at least the operators &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; 
and &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; could be overriden- perhaps the easiest way of enabling a 
generic serialization (?) 

thank you very much in advance for the help

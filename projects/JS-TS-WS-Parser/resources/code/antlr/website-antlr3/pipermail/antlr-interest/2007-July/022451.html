No, curlies are alright.

The thing that cropped up a week or so ago were the []s inside  
parameters/return values. Things like

rule returns [String[] ary]
	:	stuff ;

mmh. I think the delimiters should look like 'always' a bit. It's bit  
undefined what 'always' looks like, but it should be (1) easily  
recognizable, and (2) consistent.

Sort of like {} means action and {}? means semantic (=code)  
predicate. {}! is not really good, since it fails rule 1. Doubling  
the curlies satisfies both rules, with caveat I pointed out.
It should definitely be something with curlies, since they are  
actions. Maybe it's time to look for an Unicode character that's  
describe as 'always'?

;)

cheers,

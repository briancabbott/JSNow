<PRE>I have a 800-line ANTLR 3 grammar that works fine.  I use an editor  
TextMate to edit it.  This works, but TextMate doesn't know how to  
syntax-highlight the code.  TextMate can be trained to do so, but it's  
hard because ANTLR grammar files contain 2 mixed languages, ANTLR and  
Java.  Obviously I can live with unhighlighted code, but I notice that  
when editing several files at once with TextMate, I see some Java code  
highlighted and some not.

I know I can use ANTLRWorks, but I'd rather use a single editing tool  
than juggle multiple GUIs.  Besides, my grammar is fairly static -  
it's the interspersed Java that changes.

A while back, someone on this mailing list suggested that my grammar  
might benefit if I were to move all the Java into a separate .java  
file.  In other words, replace each occurrence of a block of Java with  
a simple Java function call, so that the bulk of the Java would move  
to the .java file.

This seems like an interesting idea.

Pros:
It would make the grammar more compact, so it would be much easier to  
&quot;see&quot; the grammar rules and StringTemplate invocations.
I'd be more tempted to train TextMate to highlight ANTLR grammars.
It would keep most of the Java in a .java file, where it can be  
highlighted correctly.

Cons:
It would be yet another source file.
It would add a bunch of argument passing.
It wouldn't deal with grammar rules that contain Java fragments, such  
as this, from my grammar:

methodDeclaration
     : dataType methodName LPAREN  
(methodParameterList{mpexists=true;})? RPAREN SEMICOLON


Anyway, does this idea have any merit?

But that is not like a C/C++ #include which pulls in another file which the 
compiler has to parse.  Java 'package' and 'import' is a bit like C++ 
'namespace' and the 'using' directive.

In bigger C/C++ it is not unusual for the compiler to have to pull in &gt; 
10,000 lines of includes every time it parses a single source file.  This 
takes time slowing the build perhaps more time than compiling the actual 
source files themselves.  Some compilers do precompiled headers to try and 
mitigate this.

Can get in trouble though if you compile one file that has a dependency 
which already has a class file available....it doesnt check to see if the 
dependency source is out of date with respect to its class file unless the 
dependency itself is also specified on the command line.

&gt;<i>The traditional way of compiling C/C++ one file at a time under make

</I>
Yes for sure - the javac compiler has to start up a jvm which is expensive, 
some relief can be gained by using a compiler like jikes if you like makefiles.

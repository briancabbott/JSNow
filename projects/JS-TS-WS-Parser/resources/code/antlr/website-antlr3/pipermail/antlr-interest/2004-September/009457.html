<PRE>Hello,
I'm trying to construct trees from my grammar and have run into two problems:

a) rule: leftExpr ( ( operator1 | operator2 | operator3 ) rightExpr )?

I want to construct a tree from this with whatever results from operator
being the root node of the subtree. Note that operator1-3 are rules, so I
can't write &quot;operator1^&quot;. Is there a simple way of solving this? I've
somewhat succeeded with declaring a local variable within the rule and
writing &quot;(o1:operator1 { opnode = #o1; } | o2:operator2 { opnode = #o2 }
...)&quot; and constructing the tree manually afterwards. But this doesn't seem
very clean to me. Is there a better solution?

b) rule: someExpr ( OPERATOR someExpr )*
I want to create a subtree which roots at the first someExpr and all other
someExpr should be a child of the preceding someExpr. I could drag down
the (OPERATOR ...)* rule to someExpr and recurse which would eliminate the
problem with a possibly infinite number of expressions on the right side:

|<i> rule: someExpr
</I>|<i> someExpr: ( the usual stuff ) ( OPERATOR someExpr )?
</I>
( The drawback with this method is that the maximum call depth within my
gramamr would get increased by that a lot. I don't know if that will
really be a problem though.) But I don't really know how to get further
from here (I'm getting infinite loops with everything I try). Can anyone
help me with this?

Both of these problems could be easily solved by allowing the caret (^)
operator not only on tokens but also on grammar rules. Is there a specific
reason for not doing this?

Regards,
Martin

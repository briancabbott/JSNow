<PRE>Hi,
 
&gt;<i> The point of terminology is to help convey ideas. It doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> matter that no terminology is perfect. It does matter that 
</I>&gt;<i> some terminologies are better at getting the point across. 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not arguing about something
</I>&gt;<i> abstract and theoretical, I'm arguing that the &quot;syntactic predicate&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> terminology could be better.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Better&quot; not meaning &quot;more valid&quot;, of course, but meaning 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;better at conveying to ANTLR users what it's used for&quot;.
</I>
Following on from my previous post:

Syntactic predicates: 
  - Used to check the syntax independent of context.
  OR
  - Used to check the &quot;form of the input&quot; independent of context.
  OR
  - Used to check the &quot;word- and phrase-level structure of the input&quot;
independent of context.
  OR
  - Used to check the &quot;word-level and phrase-level structure of the input
(be it a character stream or a word/token stream)&quot; independent of context.

Semantic predicates: Used to check/resolve context-depenendent ambiguities.

The precise mechanism used to implement either isn't particularly
interesting from the PoV of trying to understand what they are used for.

&gt;<i> I DO object to you saying &quot;syntax==structure&quot; and then 
</I>&gt;<i> starting to say &quot;structure&quot; instead of syntax.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that's perfectly valid in theory. In practice, though, 
</I>&gt;<i> it's obscuring things, as we're discussing the term &quot;syntax&quot; itself.
</I>
In our domain, &quot;syntax&quot; is concerned with [rules that define] the structure
of valid strings (words and phrases) in a language over some alphabet. Using
syntax and structure interchangably isn't particularly odious.

&gt;<i> I know that no terminology is perfect, so why do people keep 
</I>&gt;<i> going down this deep rabbit hole of what exactly &quot;syntax&quot; means?
</I>&gt;<i> In the end, it doesn't matter that it actually, deep down, 
</I>&gt;<i> means &quot;the form of ANY input&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> What matters is that people who use ANTLR typically use 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;syntax&quot; to mean &quot;form OF THE (initial) INPUT&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> (At least the people who write software rather than 
</I>&gt;<i> participate in these abstract debates).
</I>
Agreed. Structure of the input. As defined by our language and it's
alphabet. As fed to our recognizers - lexers, parsers and treeparsers.

We don't typically (at least most here don't seem to) restrict our use of
the word &quot;syntax&quot; to describe just lexer (or parser) input. As mentioned
previously, the [expanded form of the] name for TreeParser input (AST) has
the word &quot;syntax&quot; in it.

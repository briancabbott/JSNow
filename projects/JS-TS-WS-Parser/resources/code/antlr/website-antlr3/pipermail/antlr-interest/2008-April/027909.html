<PRE>OK, judging from the total lack of reactions, I either asked a really
stupid question (been there, done that, didn't get the t-shirt), or I
asked something that's been explained so often that no one could be
bothered to explain it again (in this case I suck at searching the
internet, which would kind of surprise me)

Generally, if I have a largish grammar in perfect working order, and I
want to make one keyword optional, but this causes ANTLR to have
ambiguity in the parser (Input such as 'Identifier' can be matched in
multiple ways), how would you solve this?

ANTLR hints at backtracking, left factoring and syntactic predicates.
Backtracking is not really an option for performance reasons (that, and
backtracking feels like a last resort for when nothing else really
works).

Left factoring could be an option. Unfortunately, the paths through the
grammar that ANTLR takes to arrive at the ambiguity (as visualized by
ANTLRWorks), are rather long, since they go through all the expressions
in the 'precedence ladder', so these paths involve 20+ parser rules. I
don't really see how to left factor that big a chunk of my grammar.

So, I guess this leaves predicates as an option. The grammar I'm trying
to change is rather clean, it just builds an AST and does not use any
predicates so far, which (partially) explains my lack of knowledge on
the predicates. 

After this longwinded prose, the real question would then be: How could
I use predicates to solve the ambiguity in my grammar?

Any input is appreciated!

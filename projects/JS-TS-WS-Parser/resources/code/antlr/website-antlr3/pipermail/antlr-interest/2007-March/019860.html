<PRE>No - it is just that in Java and C++ you can &quot;get away&quot; with doing that
so they can be placed there - besides if I say you can't do that in the
C target then you can't ;-P. Perhaps we should update those examples so
they don't do that. But it is horses for courses mate - C requies
certain ways of doing things and Java another.

We are subject to the rules of the target language and most C compilers
do not let us declare things inline, despite what the standard says
about that. However the best solution (if you need a variable that is in
scope for the whole rule) is to have @declarations, which I will
guarantee to insert before any code. This way everyone is happy and
nobody gets nailed to a cross.

Oh yes it is.  I've seen examples in the distribution and the 
documentation that do exactly that :)

Though see my other post for a possible idea out of this, if you 
really don't want to move where @init gets applied.

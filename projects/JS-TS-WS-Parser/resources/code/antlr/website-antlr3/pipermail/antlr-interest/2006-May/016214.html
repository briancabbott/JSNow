<PRE>&gt;<i> What would you checkpoint then, the entire heap &amp; stack? Somehow the 
</I>&gt;<i> user needs to tell you what is going to be changed as you can't find 
</I>&gt;<i> it out from looking at the code, at least not generally (Turing 
</I>&gt;<i> anyone?) and certainly not easily in imperative languages. You can't 
</I>&gt;<i> generate a checkpoint without either knowing what to save or copying 
</I>&gt;<i> the whole machine.

We're still talking DFA's right? Depending on whether the DFA is state-centric or transition-centric, you would put the Command stucturally in a State or Transition... Just thinking out loud here.
 
I think the size of the serialization 'file' should be configurable on startup. A circular log would prevent runaway log size. If the user had a really large walk from node to node before a confirmed match, they would have to make sure the log file size was configured large enough.

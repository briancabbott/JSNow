<PRE>How about a direct language feature to issue a warning or error on parsing
a rule...

I.e. you have a grammar where certain improper syntax is expected. You
make a rule
that will recognize the improper syntax or semantics and issue a syntax
error with 
a better error description when the rule is matched. The side effect of
encountering
an error rule is the normal unwinding that occurs on a parse failure.

&gt;<i>Hi, In parallel with the development of ANTLR v4, superstar Colin Bean
</I>&gt;<i>will be building the new version of ANTLRWorks. We already have a great
</I>&gt;<i>base in what Jean Bovet did for the 1st version. It's a known entity and
</I>&gt;<i>has lots of bookkeeping code that we can cut and paste into the new one
</I>&gt;<i>such as the automatic update facility and preferences. Because we've got
</I>&gt;<i>something to play with, we have something to critique and also a basic
</I>&gt;<i>target.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I can imagine the basic tool being missing but it would be great to get
</I>&gt;<i>feedback from the antlr community.  Remember, that there are probably 2
</I>&gt;<i>main communities: the people new to languages and/or ANTLR and the people
</I>&gt;<i>very used to working with ANTLR grammars. For example, new people tend to
</I>&gt;<i>like the syntax diagrams but many old-timers like myself prefer looking
</I>&gt;<i>at the grammar because it's more terse.  Recognizing that we must serve
</I>&gt;<i>both those communities, please comment with any thoughts on the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>* What feature seemed like a good idea, but didn't end up being that
</I>&gt;<i>valuable? You can say even heretical things like: &quot; the single step
</I>&gt;<i>feature in the debugger just didn't seem to be that useful beyond
</I>&gt;<i>learning about parsing&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>* Do you use the re-factoring? Keep in mind that v4 will automatically
</I>&gt;<i>handle direct left recursion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>* What features do you think are really critical to add?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>* What features could be really great if we improved them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>* Do we need better export facilities?   would you really use things like
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;export grammar as hyperlinked HTML&quot;, for example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>* What parts of the debugger did you use? There is a lot of stuff in
</I>&gt;<i>there like: breakpoints on input tokens, step forward, step backward,
</I>&gt;<i>jump to the end, break on specific kinds of events, break at specific
</I>&gt;<i>line in the grammar, show the parse tree, show the AST constructed, list
</I>&gt;<i>to the incoming events, etc...  Should we rethink the entire notion of
</I>&gt;<i>the debugger at something that simply displays information about what it
</I>&gt;<i>sees during the parse?  I.e., doesn't need to be a controller in the
</I>&gt;<i>sense that you can single step the actual running parser over the usual
</I>&gt;<i>socket connection?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You might include whether you are in the newbie or experienced camp or
</I>&gt;<i>somewhere in between.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Udo Borkowski has already implemented a fantastic tree layout algorithm
</I>&gt;<i>from an academic paper. The performance is extremely good and the results
</I>&gt;<i>are tight.  Colin will probably implement his own syntax diagram viewer
</I>&gt;<i>so that we can make it more than just a pretty picture. We want to
</I>&gt;<i>highlight elements and step through etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks!

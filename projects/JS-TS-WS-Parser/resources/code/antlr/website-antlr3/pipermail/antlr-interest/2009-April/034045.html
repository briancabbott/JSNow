Good point. I forgot about shared scope stacks.

&gt;<i> Also, you should probably switch state in ruleZ and not in the caller, 
</I>&gt;<i> using the @init and @after actions for ruleZ.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it needs to be able to change it for the duration of ruleZ (and stuff 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> under ruleZ might change it as well for things under themselves) while 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changing it back to whatever it was on entering ruleX after it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> finishes with ruleZ. All assuming that X Y (ruleZ)? wouldn't be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ambiguous, of course.
</I>&gt;<i> This is why you should really merge it all into the one rule that know 
</I>&gt;<i> everything, then reject the invalid constructs later, so long as they 
</I>&gt;<i> are syntactically sound. Your parser is there only to verify syntactic 
</I>&gt;<i> structure, not to check that it is the right structure for the right place.
</I>
The thing is, in this case &quot;in the right place&quot; isn't just a case of 
being the right type for what it's being assigned to, for instance - 
it's a case of there being two very different constructs that occur in 
very different places (except once, and that's a separate problem), 
inside different syntactic constructs - there's precisely one place that 
  both are allowed, and it's admittedly a pain in the but, but there's a 
few solutions I'm considering. On the other hand, trying to combine the 
two unambiguously would lead to an AST barely more useful than a flat 
token stream, and the treewalker isn't going to be in that much of a 
better position to handle semantics. The handling of the token stream 
would be left to the post-parse semantic stage, which is much less 
convenient for handling it (difference between hand-crafting parser in 
Java and using ANTLR, essentially). The only compromise I can see would 
be keeping in the specific rules and calling them as start rules on a 
synthetic token stream, once everything else is on to true semantic stuff.

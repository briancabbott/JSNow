Well, there was an error in my thinking here.  That's why it's taken  
4 years to get &quot;right&quot;.  Damn real world invalidates a number of my  
assumptions and I have to alter the algorithm to suit. ;)  Principle:  
You only predict on valid input; I think errors are left to &quot;if ! 
valid prediction&quot;; i.e., the opposite of &quot;good&quot; must be &quot;bad&quot;. No  
need to look for &quot;bad&quot; explicitly.

&gt;<i> And I'm still not sure how assuming that any character at all could  
</I>&gt;<i> follow the &quot;e&quot; in &quot;one&quot; means that you don't need to test that the  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;e&quot; is actually there at all.  But I'll take your word for it.
</I>
I think a proof would abstract the issue to:

r : x .* | .* ;

where x is any alternative in any grammar.  Static analysis involves  
using more and more lookahead until you can distinguish between  
alts.  x and .* look identical by definition so you look past x  
hoping to distinguish.  Ooops. .* follows.  At this point, you  
concede defeat.  Only solution is to predict with entire x; i.e., you  
must backtrack like lex does or using Idle Jim's syn pred solution ;)

Now, had I done this sketch of a proof earlier I would realize that  
assuming .* follows is overly general; well, actually, it's just  
wrong.  Using LL(*) rather than a DFA to do lexing is something ANTLR  
along with other folks (scannerless parsing people) is pushing the  
envelop on.  I *hope* the change doesn't mess up stuff like keyword  
vs ID.  Could involve a lot of thought / testing on my part to verify  
I haven't screwed up something else.

&gt;<i> &gt;NUMBER: ('0'..'9')+ ('.' ('0'..'9')+)?;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;DOT : '.' ;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;NUMBER: ('0'..'9')+ ('.' ('0'..'9')+)?;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;OTHER: .;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;ONE: 'one';
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;TWO: 'two';
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;OTHER: .;
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Note that all three examples are ambiguous. Same input,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;different rules can match.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If all rules have equal precedence, then sure, they're ambiguous.   
</I>&gt;<i> But I thought the lexer was supposed to have defined precedence  
</I>&gt;<i> (longest match and/or first listed token wins)..?
</I>
Yep, hence you won't get an error between token rules ;)

 &gt;Actually, I did fix the problem you reported and I emailed you 
to
 &gt;tell you that it was fixed. Your problem was that when action 
code
 &gt;was in the lexer rule the declarations were out of order. This 
is
 &gt;different - you cannot DECLARE variables in @init.

Ummm, true.  I did report that one first.  Maybe I forgot to 
report the @init declaration thing after all... I know I 
encountered it at one point.  Or maybe I just assumed they were 
related, so didn't need a followup report.  Who knows.

I don't recall receiving a reply about that bugfix though.  Maybe 
I just have a terrible memory, or maybe the mail got swallowed by 
a rampaging bitbucket.  Oh well :)

Thanks for the @declarations change! ;)

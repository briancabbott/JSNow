<PRE>I am attaching zip file that contains 3 Subdirectories... Each one
contains a readme.txt that illustrates what I did.  The generated output
should be there as well.


FYI...The only Lexer that is &quot;wrong&quot; is the one generated from
AntlrWorks from Within Idea(AntlrWorksInIdea subdirectory).  Which means
it's probably something between the Environemnt on IntelliJ and the
AntlrWorks plugin.

I hope this helps.

Thanks
Thomas

</I>Hi. Make sure to regenerate all lexers, which no longer should ref  
that rule nesting thing.  It works on all my tests etc..., but, that  
said, when I tried to rebuild the mantra language example yesterday i  
got similar issues...can you try antlr from command line?  Try to  
reduce to a simple grammar and send to me if it still fails.
thanks!

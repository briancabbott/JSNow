Thanks!  we are getting closer and closer to a final release, but I'm  
fixing bugs only when they interfere with what I am typing in the  
book. ;) My deadline is essentially end of January for the book in  
order to get it published and in stores by May. then I will devote  
full time to getting a full 3.0 release out.

&gt;<i> I have an additional question about the example grammar, the lexer  
</I>&gt;<i> and perhaps Eclipse itself.
</I>&gt;<i> The example, Expr appears to hang when I run it in Eclipse, and

</I>&gt;<i> that the ANTLRInputStream constructor does not terminate.  Why is  
</I>&gt;<i> that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My questions are:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Have I somehow screwed things up that the symptoms I'm seeing

</I>
I think eclipse probably does not know how to say EOF.  Convert to  
use ANTLRFileStream and pass it a file name with that input.

&gt;<i> 2) In Eclipse, is it possible to pass an EOF to System.in? (not an  
</I>&gt;<i> Antlr question, but maybe I'll
</I>&gt;<i>    get lucky).
</I>
Some  eclipse guy can tell, but I cannot ;)

&gt;<i> 3) If I want to limit buffering to one line of input at a time, is  
</I>&gt;<i> there some other input class
</I>&gt;<i>    I should be using in ANTLR.
</I>
Right now, ANTLR sucks everything in by default. I believe people are  
working on some on-demand stuff.

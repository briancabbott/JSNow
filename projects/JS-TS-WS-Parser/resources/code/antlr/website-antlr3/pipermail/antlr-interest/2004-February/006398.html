<PRE>Thanks for the fix, that sets it up just fine.

As it happens, it seems that there are spaces where a whitespace is
semantically different from one with a linefeed in it, so i'm kind of
stuck with it.

However, since i'm getting answers anyway, perhaps i can get a tip on
this one as well:

I want rules to match a few different types of words - there's a few
literals, some words that begin &quot;X-&quot; and then there's a few places
where any non-control ascii character is allowed, provided semicolons
are escaped.

These are three separate types of token, but you can imagine there are
a few ambiguities - how do i go about handling that?

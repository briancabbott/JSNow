<PRE>Folks,
	In case people want to comment on specifics of my recent article
<A HREF="http://www.codetransform.com/filterexample.html,">http://www.codetransform.com/filterexample.html,</A> I'm posting the text of it
here so it can be archived and quoted.

Using a Parser as a TokenFilter

I was trying out some &quot;extreme programming&quot; while rewriting a parser for
AREV Basic, exploring incremental fixes to the problem of keywords being
used as identifiers. The first one I encountered was labels (as in GOTO)
with the name &quot;Exit&quot;, which is also a Basic statement. In this case I
reasoned that I could detect the &quot;GOTO&quot; and then safely assume that what
followed it was a really a label and not a keyword.

I didn't want to recognize this in the lexer, because I didn't want to
explicitly deal with whitespace in a rule, and I didn't want to check the
literals table myself for the jump statements (some of which are two tokens
long).


Doing it in the parser leads to various ambiguity warnings, especially
because antlr's &quot;linear approximate&quot; lookahead ORs together tests for each k
of lookahead and these constructs are both one and two tokens long. The
simple example is that '&quot;GO&quot; label' and '&quot;GO&quot; &quot;TO&quot; label' are valid. The
label rule needs to allow keywords and identifiers as labels, but of course
&quot;TO&quot; is among those. So then I have to use syntactic predicates combined
with a semantic predicate that answers the question of whether this token is
a literal or not.

I felt the easiest thing to do would be to have a parser written as a
TokenStreamFilter to recognize a jump statement like &quot;GOTO&quot; and then expect
a label, coercing any keywords into a label as needed. If something else
like an operator or String is found I just pass it along as it and let the
parser deal with the error. Line numbers (optionally followed by a colon)
are valid labels.

A TokenStreamFilter simply implements one method: nextToken(). In my lexer I
mark any IDENT or keyword token with the boolean &quot;possibleId&quot; as true. I
wanted to write a parser like 


jumpStatements:
    (   &quot;GO&quot; (&quot;TO&quot;)? 
     |  &quot;GOTO&quot;
     |  &quot;GOSUB&quot;
     |  &quot;RETURN&quot; &quot;TO&quot;
     ) 
     labelReferences
     ;
 exception 
     catch [RecognitionException ex] {
           consume();
     }
 
 labelReferences:
     labelReference (COMMA labelReference)*
     ;
 
 labelReference
     :   tok:~(EOL) { if ( ((ArevToken)tok).possibleId  ||
tok.getType()==NUMBER_LITERAL)
                     { 
                             tok.setType(LABEL_REFERENCE);
                     }
             }
         (COLON)? 
     ;
 
 
I would always enter at jumpStatements. If it failed to recognize something
I simply consume() that token and pass it on. So there is the first
problem--how do I pass on these tokens to the next parser? nextToken() only
returns one token at a time but this parser wants to match more than one
token at a time. I decided to use antlr.TokenQueue to queue up the tokens.
nextToken() would first check to take a token off the queue, and if it was
empty it would call jumpStatements to prime the queue. Using TokenQueue this
way required some slight modifications, making it public and adding a
length() method.

Now how to get the tokens into the queue? In this case I want to pass on
every token received, it's just that in some cases I want to change the
type. So I decided to override consume() to add tokens to the queue. That
way I knew all tokens that came through would be put in the queue. With this
approach I had to take special care to handle RecognitionExceptions by using
consume() on the token that caused the exceptions. One of my first bugs was
getting into an infinite loop on a RecognitionException because I wasn't
eating the offending token. That way I guarantee that everytime I call
jumpStatements at least one token will be put in the queue.

     public void consume() 
     {
         try 
         {
             queue.append(LT(1));
         }
         catch (TokenStreamException e) 
         {
             // do nothing
         }
         super.consume();
     }
 
     public Token nextToken() throws TokenStreamException 
     {
         Token ret;
         if (queue.length()&lt;=0)
         {
             try 
             {
                 jumpStatements();
             }
             catch ( RecognitionException e) {;}
             catch ( TokenStreamException e) {;}
         }
         ret = queue.elementAt(0);
         queue.removeFirst();
         return ret;
     }
 
The glue for being able to run this is this class:

 public class LabelReferenceFilter  implements TokenStream 
 {
     BASICLabelReferenceParser streamParser;
     public LabelReferenceFilter(TokenStream input) 
     {
         streamParser  = new BASICLabelReferenceParser(input);
     }
 
     public Token nextToken() throws TokenStreamException 
     {
         Token tok = streamParser.nextToken();
         return tok;
     }
 }
 
Now it turns out that I had another problem to solve with this filter. The
parser I was working with was written to expect &quot;end of line&quot; tokens to
separate statements. The lexer was written to send those EOL tokens, but it
wasn't easy to collapse EOLs separated by whitespace into one EOL because of
comments (which depended on knowing if their * or ! was the first thing on a
line (after whitespace). Once out of the lexer the whitespace and comments
would be gone, so it would be easy to collapse multiple EOLs into one. I
modified the consume() method to collapse multiple EOLs in a row:

     boolean currentIsNewline =  LA(1)==EOL;
     if (!(previousWasNewline &amp;&amp; currentIsNewline))
     {
         queue.append(LT(1));
     }
     previousWasNewline = currentIsNewline;
 
It also happened that calling labelReferences directly from jumpStatements
didn't work because the parser assumed that EOF would follow when in fact
this was working more like a lexer which gets called multiple times on the
same stream and shouldn't be assuming EOF. So I modified it to call
labelReferences as a method, not as a rule call, to avoid the associated
lookahead. Then I also noticed I needed to handle the case where EOLs
followed the jump, so I do my own testing of LA(1) to decide what to do. To
handle syntax errors properly I also added the expectingLabel variable and
set it to false if something goes wrong. Finally, here's the complete
working BASICLabelReference.g file:

 header {
 
 import ArevToken;
 import java.util.Hashtable;
 import antlr.TokenQueue;
 }
 
 class BASICLabelReferenceParser extends Parser;
 options {
     importVocab=BASIC;
     k=1;
 }
 
 {
     TokenQueue queue = new TokenQueue(6);
     boolean expectingLabel = false;
     boolean previousWasNewline = false;
 
   public void consume() {
             try 
             {
                 boolean currentIsNewline =  LA(1)==EOL;
                 if (!(previousWasNewline &amp;&amp; currentIsNewline))
                 {
                     queue.append(LT(1));
                 }
                 previousWasNewline = currentIsNewline;
             }
             catch (TokenStreamException e) 
             {
                 System.err.println(e);
                 e.printStackTrace();
                 // do nothing
             }
             super.consume();
 	}
 
     public Token nextToken() throws TokenStreamException 
     {
         Token ret;
         if (queue.length()&lt;=0)
         {
             try 
             {
                  jumpStatements();
             }
             catch ( RecognitionException e) {;}
             catch ( TokenStreamException e) {;}
         }
         if (queue.length()&gt;0) 
         {
             ret = queue.elementAt(0);
             queue.removeFirst();
             return ret;
         }
         return new ArevToken(Token.EOF_TYPE,&quot;&quot;);
     }
 }
 
 jumpStatements:

     |  &quot;GOTO&quot;

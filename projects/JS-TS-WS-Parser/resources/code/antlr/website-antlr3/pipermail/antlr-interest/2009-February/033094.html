Well, written out as a &quot;concrete syntax pattern&quot;, this looks somewhat 
like &quot;pattern(x) = x + 0 ==&gt; x&quot;. There exist lots of tools that do this, 
MatchO maybe can be extended to do it with similar syntax, although some 
feature may be missing from a fully fledged term rewriting engine (order 
of rule application, traversal etc).  (I must admit I have not used any 
of these as of now, so I'm only repeating what I saw elsewhere. I still 
have to figure out what is feasible to implement).


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's maintainable because later, when you want to also replace &quot;x*1&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> with just &quot;x&quot;, and a few
</I>&gt;<i> other similar patterns, you can make this into a generic function:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> void replaceIdentity(MyTokenType type, String value, AST root) {
</I>&gt;<i>     List&lt;AST&gt; asts = root.findAncestorsOfType(type);
</I>&gt;<i>     for (AST ast: plusses) {
</I>&gt;<i>            if (ast.getChildCount() == 2             &amp;&amp; 
</I>&gt;<i> ast.getSecondChild().getType() == MyTokenTypes.INTEGER
</I>&gt;<i>                &amp;&amp; ast.getSecondChild().getText().equals(&quot;0&quot;)) {
</I>&gt;<i>             ast.replaceMyself(ast.getFirstChild());  // replace &quot;x OP 
</I>&gt;<i> VALUE&quot; with just &quot;x&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>         }
</I>&gt;<i>     }
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And now, you just have:
</I>&gt;<i> replaceIdentity(MyTokenType.PLUS, &quot;0&quot;, root); // replace &quot;x+0&quot; with &quot;x&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> replaceIdentity(MyTokenType.MINUS, &quot;0&quot;, root);// replace &quot;x-0&quot; with &quot;x&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> replaceIdentity(MyTokenType.MULTIPLY, &quot;1&quot;, root);// replace &quot;x*1&quot; with 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;x&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> replaceIdentity(MyTokenType.DIVIDE, &quot;1&quot;, root);// replace &quot;x/1&quot; with &quot;x&quot;
</I>
Once you have such a generic function, indeed it looks interesting. If 
your application is built on top of a few of those, maybe this would 
also appeal to me. For our purposes, we need to recognize lots of 
patterns, that's why I prefer pattern matching :-)
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see how an ANTLR treewalker lets you make things modular (and 
</I>&gt;<i> thus maintainable)
</I>&gt;<i> like this.
</I>
Me too. As said above, for transformations I would prefer patterns and a 
pattern-matching-engine.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, you make yourself highly dependent on the underlying 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tree-model, which changed a lot from antlr2 to antlr3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Assuming by &quot;tree-model&quot;, you mean the shape of the AST you're 
</I>&gt;<i> creating, no,
</I>&gt;<i> that wouldn't (or shouldn't) change with the version of ANTLR that you're
</I>&gt;<i> using. You build the AST to be the shape that you want, regardless of 
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR version.
</I>
Have you used antlr3? In our application, the migration to antlr3 is a 
major effort. For example, an antlr2 AST node can be a singular node,or 
a node with a sibling, which has another sibling. So, it can be either a 
node or a list of nodes. If your code depends on this, you end up 
replacing many type definitions with List&lt;AST&gt;. Or you add the nodes you 
actually want to return to a dummy parent, return the first child of 
that parent, and let the caller find out if the returned node has a 
parent and if so, regard all its childs as the rest of the list. If you 
did not write your program in such a fashion, maybe the translation to 
antlr3 gets easier then. But still, there is a function called 
&quot;setNextSibling&quot; in antlr2. How do you emulate that in antlr3? You have 
to distinguish lots of special cases to find out if it means: addChild, 
deleteChild, deleteRangeOfChildren .. whatever.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think &quot;hand-written&quot; code to walk an AST is less
</I>&gt;<i> dependent on AST structure than an ANTLR treewalker is.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, suppose I want to find all the ancestor nodes of type
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;INT&quot;. The &quot;hand-written&quot; code is something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> List&lt;AST&gt; nodes = someNode.findAncestorsOfType(MyLanguageTokenTypes.INT);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...while the ANTLR treewalker that does the same thing consists of the
</I>&gt;<i> *entire* tree shape, with extra code added. The ANTLR treewalker forces
</I>&gt;<i> you to specify much more info than you actually care about.
</I>
You could have only a basic tree walker and inherit from that, 
overriding only the places you want. So, if you have a lot more easy 
tree walkers, the single tree-walker copy of the antlr grammar is still 
a burden, but it only exists once.
&gt;<i> If by &quot;tree-model&quot; you mean the ANTLR syntax and semantics, then 
</I>&gt;<i> obviously
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;hand-written&quot; treewalker is not dependent on it at all, while the
</I>&gt;<i> ANLTR treewalker is completely dependent on it.
</I>
Well, there might be lots of syntactic changes, but I consider these a 
lot easier to deal with than a structural change of the internal tree 
representation, as was the case between antlr2-&gt;antlr3. And if you dont 
like treewalker's at all, then maybe generic visitors/combinators could 
be of interest to you (see JJtraveller). Maybe it's possible to also 
write such a tool for antlr, so that, in effect, you get a 
base-tree-walker (without any actions) for free.

So, although my mail contains lots of speculation, I hope it provides 
some ideas that seem useful to you :-)

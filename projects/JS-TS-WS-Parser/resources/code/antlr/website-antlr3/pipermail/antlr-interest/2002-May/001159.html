If there's a grammar that includes all tokens (in this case,
possibly your tree-walker), let that one be the exporter.

Though, I think the typical case is that the parser includes
all relevant tokens from the lexer, no?  You seem to indicate
that's not true, which confuses me, personally.

I find that my parser has it's own tokens, uses the 'public' 
lexer tokens, and constructs the tree using possibly more tree
tokens.

I don't see how a tree-walker can deal with lexer-based tokens
that the parser knows nothing about.  How'd the tree get a lexer
token without the parser seeing it?

Anyhow, there's really no distinction between parser, lexer and
tree-walker tokens.  The whole point is of course to unify them
into a single token set, and each parser may only use a subset
of the entire set.

So, if by some chance, there is no lexer/parser/tree-walker that
contains all tokens, simply add them in the tokens{} block, and
consider that file to be the master which does the exportVocab
and is antlr'd first.  All others importVocab, and are compile
subsequently.

btw, I've never worked with antlr/C++, so things may be different
from my java-based world view.

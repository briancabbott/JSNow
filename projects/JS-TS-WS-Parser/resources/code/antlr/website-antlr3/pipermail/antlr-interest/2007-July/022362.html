Yes.  ANTLR doesn't do the natural thing here.  For normal cases,  
it's not an issue.  Few tokens are prefixes like that.  Normally it's  
keyword against 'a'..'z'+ not 'a'..'z'.

&gt;<i> In the current implementation, though, the predictor sees 'ab' and  
</I>&gt;<i> immediately declares &quot;That must be a KEYWORD!&quot; -- even when the  
</I>&gt;<i> input is actually 'aba', whose only &quot;correct&quot; output would be OTHER  
</I>&gt;<i> OTHER OTHER.  So this results in an exception rather than producing  
</I>&gt;<i> the right output.
</I>
Well, it does what I expected so it's &quot;correct&quot;, just not what you  
want ;)

&gt;<i> &gt;It uses PROGRAM rule w/o the + because what if you had an error
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;char?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure what you meant by this.
</I>
I create Tokens : T1 | T2 | T3 ... ;

for tokens to do matching.

&gt;<i> &gt;There is an implied loop to PROGRAM in nextToken() method.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the predictor doesn't know anything about it -- hence the problem.
</I>
It assume any char because that is correct.  You could put any char  
after a token, yes?

&gt;<i> This whole thing makes it really hard to write correct lexers --  
</I>&gt;<i> especially since ANTLR also seems to ignore predicates if it thinks  
</I>&gt;<i> it knows better.  If this one thing was fixed then it'd make ANTLR  
</I>&gt;<i> significantly easier to use.
</I>
(...)=&gt; and {...}?=&gt; will always be executed.

&gt;<i> And I've been saying that for ages now :)
</I>
And not reading about {...}?=&gt; ? ;)  They should always be executed.

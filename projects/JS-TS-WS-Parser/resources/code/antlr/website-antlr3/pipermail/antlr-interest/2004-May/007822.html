I thought the DOM document merely is a tree where each node also may 
have attributes. What is XML specific here? Have I missed anything?

</I>
Not necessarily. AFAIK no XML schema allows attributes to be more than 
mere annotations. I.e. you can not use them to steer the direction of 
the parse. This means you can not use attributes to either allow or 
forbid subsequent elements. This in turn means there is not need to 
specify attributes in tree grammars. Thus I agree that attributes are 
merely instance variables of ASTs, no need to formalize anything here.

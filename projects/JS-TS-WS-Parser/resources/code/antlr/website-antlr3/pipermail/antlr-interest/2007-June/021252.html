Interesting. I get that memory error unless I use:

java -Xmx80M Test

  which makes sense because all of the keywords you have.  The DFA  
must be huge.  Yep, if you look at DFA4_eotS, which is a run length  
encoding of the DFA tables, you'll see that they can get very big.   
80M seems to make it work okay.

  just increase the memory a little bit.

</I>
ANTLR does not seem to like tokens that can match no characters,  
which you have a grammar:

StrNoHash                       : CharNoHash*;
StrNoQuotAmp                    : CharNoQuotAmp*;

These are meaningless because (...)* loops are optional. I think  
antlr might be going crazy here for these tokens, but I believe I  
have a bug report and already.

  thanks for the report.

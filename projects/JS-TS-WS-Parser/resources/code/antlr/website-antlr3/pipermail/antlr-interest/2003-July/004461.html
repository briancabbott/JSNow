<PRE>Hi,

Dunno ;) It probably grew that way when I was implementing the stuff. But
you have a point it could probably be static.

</I>
The problem with the factory is that it needs to be the same thing for a
complete lexer/parser/treewalker/rewriter chain. Trying to do all factory
initializations intelligently might prove cumbersome. At the time I
couldn't think of a failproof way of guaranteeing the right initializations
in a complete chain of (tree)parsers (without having to hack too much into
antlr).

Furthermore I wanted it to crash if people tried to see how far they'd get
without reading the release notes/docs. It is very easy to screw up your
project by not initializing the factory correctly. Going on the amount of
mail I got about crashes due to no RTFM I think that was a good decision ;)

Basically I'm still of the opinion that trying to do heterogenous AST's
with ANTLR 2 is not a good idea. At least one should be prepared to run
into vague bugs oversights etc. More than once I've been on the verge of
just ripping it out, (motto: if you can't do it well don't do it).

I'll look at making the thing static and the subclass idea when I have some
more time (next weekish probably).

Cheers,

Ric

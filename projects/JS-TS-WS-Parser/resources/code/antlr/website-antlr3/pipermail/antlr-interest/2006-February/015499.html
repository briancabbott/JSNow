<PRE>Actually I just realised that replacing compoundStatement with
statementSequence won't give you the grammar you're after. Perhaps just
making simpleStatement non-optional will do the trick...

Let me preface these comments with &quot;I'm an ANTLR newbie with an
imperfect mental map of what ANTLR does&quot;, but that said, I think it's
complaining because your compoundStatement can contain a compound
statements or empty simple statements.

So it's thinking goes something like this:

program: PROGRAM ID SEMI_COLON -&gt;
compoundStatement: BEGIN 
    and then either (simpleStatement/*completely optional so can be
empty*/ SEMI simpleStatement /*completely optional so can be empty*/)
    or
    compountStatement: BEGIN
;


So it gets to BEGIN and says to itself, &quot;Well it looks like it's
complete valid to follow the BEGIN with another BEGIN or with a
completely empty simpleStatement followed by a SEMI colon...&quot;

Anyway, that's my guess at it.

I'd say if you replaced:

program: PROGRAM ID SEMI_COLON (typeDefinitions)?
(variableDeclarations)? (subprogramDeclarations)? compoundStatement;

With something like:

program: PROGRAM ID SEMI_COLON (typeDefinitions)?
(variableDeclarations)? (subprogramDeclarations)? statementSequence;


And:

simpleStatement : ( (assignmentStatement | procedureStatement) )?;

With

simpleStatement : (assignmentStatement | procedureStatement);



A lot of your problems will go away.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Understanding nondeterminism warnings: and how
todebug them

I cant seem to get rid of the few nondeterminism warnings that appear
when I attempt to generate the parser.
How would I debug something like this? Line #14 does not have &quot;BEGIN&quot; 
...how do the warning line #'s correspond to my grammar?
This is my first attempt to generate some grammar, and I know I lack
much(all) of the intuition behind it.

Hopefully you guys/gals can help me get trough this :) I have attached
my grammar file.
This is the error nondeterminism error I get:

grammer.txt:14:75: warning:nondeterminism between alts 1 and 2 of block
upon
grammer.txt:14:75:     k==1:BEGIN
grammer.txt:40: warning:nondeterminism upon
grammer.txt:40:     k==1:SEMI_COLON
grammer.txt:40:     between alt 1 and exit branch of block
grammer.txt:58:21: warning:nondeterminism between alts 1 and 2 of block
upon
grammer.txt:58:21:     k==1:ID
grammer.txt:69:56: warning:nondeterminism between alts 1 and 2 of block
upon
grammer.txt:69:56:     k==1:ELSE
grammer.txt:105: warning:nondeterminism between alts 3 and 4 of block
upon
grammer.txt:105:     k==1:ID

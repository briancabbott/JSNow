<PRE>Yes, but be careful.  Any communications upstream from the parser to
the lexer have a funny smell to them.  If you can change your design
(or is this a requirement?), it's probably better to do that.

...

Since you mark a token as being skipped by setting it's type, you can
do this with some nifty interface - or a global variable :-)

The &quot;be careful&quot; has to do with lookahead.  If the lexer gets a few
tokens ahead of the parser, it's possible to &quot;see&quot; a newline in
declaration mode that should, in fact, terminate a statement.

I'm making this up, as I don't know your grammar, but consider:

   decl ....
   a=b

If you scanner reads the newline after &quot;b&quot; before the parser knows to
switch from decl to statement mode, it will ignore that newline.

If you allow declarations to follow statements, you see the same
problem in reverse:
   // I'm assuming &quot;i: integer&quot; is a declaration here
   a = b
   i
   : integer
Now, the newline after &quot;i&quot; might cause problems because it's not clear
if this is a declaration or a statement.

As a general rule, be aware of k in LL(k), and also - where I've been
burned - syntactic predicates which require more information that is
available

    ( decl ) =&gt; decl
    | statement

It's likely that (decl) will not match because the newlines are not
being correctly processed - and therefore your grammar will attempt to
process something that looks like a declaration as a statement.

Hope this helps,
B-)

<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>My final update of the CPP_parser (V3.2) using ANTLR V2.7 to generate
C++ parser in C++ is now available on the <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org">http://www.antlr.org</A>
website.
 
I now wish to retire and to hand on this C++ grammar file for someone
else to look after for maintenance and further development. For
instance, I hope he/she would be able adapt it for use with ANTLR V3
(when C++ output is available!) and/or use it to generate Java code
(instead of or in addition to C++).
 
Potential volunteer(s) please contact me for further information and
co-ordination of hand-over.
 
I expect to be available to assist with any problems with this new
version and also for consultation about further developments.

Yes, this is no problem, although it looks a bit ugly at times ;)
If you do not have a whole lot of those cases it shouldn't be a concern.
I.e. you could solve this with syntactic predicates.

Am I understanding you correctly, in that you want to have a dynamic  
lexer rule, or
do you want this:
I could imagine to do this is to let the lexer recognize the said  
strings
as WORDs and then use a custom action to look up the token's text in  
your external
dictionary. You could indicate a recognition error to ANTLR and try  
error recovery
(like ANTLR does internally) or simply fail.
If you want the latter, this is easy. Dynamically changing lexer  
rules isn't because
that would affect lookahead.
Another way could be to employ syntactic predicates, but it really  
depends on what you
are trying to achieve.

&gt;<i> Am I using Antlr in the right context here?
</I>
If you are doing language recognition, yes ;)

HTH,

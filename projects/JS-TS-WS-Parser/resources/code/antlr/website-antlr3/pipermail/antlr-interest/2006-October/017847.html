Its weird that you're walking token streams, but what it seems it that
you're implementing the recursive descent parser by hand...

I believe there is an unspoken rule that all bets are off with COBOL?

</I>
Well, in your case you're managing both. In my case, I just worry about
telling antlr the grammar and managing the symbol table appropriately.

For my compiler, I needed to spit out lots of warnings since it was
basically a cfront type deal, albeit not for C++ (thankfully!) I found
that having a crude symbol table was very easy and natural. I couldn't
imagine re-parsing the token stream just to determine the type of a
variable, something I might need to do more than once. For example, if
you see:

	a.b();

You might need to know if a is a class (this making b a static function
call) or an object. Once you have decided that a is one or the other, I
don't see why you'd do it again...

Since the compiler has been in regular use for about 7-8 months, there
have been a few bug fixes and lots of feature requests. I've found that
having a symbol table available is a great help.

&gt;<i> But I agree with your general point: if you really often need to &quot;know 
</I>&gt;<i> where you are&quot; then
</I>&gt;<i> an AST helps alot. I've found that I rarely need to know &quot;where I am&quot; in 
</I>&gt;<i> the source.
</I>
Hmm... I guess I understand.

Thanks,

Sohail

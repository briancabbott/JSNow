<PRE>&gt;<i> What society are you referring to?  Or perhaps the question should be, what
</I>&gt;<i> society in which country allows people to give away their work and still
</I>&gt;<i> eat?  Even in communist societies, people work and receive compensation.
</I>
I'm certainly not referring to communism (I don't like communism as
seen in the USSR, China, etc.) Indeed, there is no country I know of
where people can make intellectual works for a living without charging
for copies (or at least giving up their rights to a corporation that
sells/uses their work). And I would point out that treaties like the
Berne convention and TRIPS tend to prevent countries--even communist
countries--from differentiating their intellectual property laws from
those of the U.S.

It's not a state of affairs I'm happy with. Many people demonize file
sharing and freedom to copy, whereas I think freedom of information is
wonderful and I would prefer to find a way for society to pay those
whose works are copied.

&gt;<i> There's nothing wrong with our society here in the U.S., if that's what
</I>&gt;<i> you're referring to.  Quite the opposite.  Our society allows people like
</I>&gt;<i> Ter the freedom to pursue their dreams and goals, and the freedom to decide
</I>&gt;<i> what to do with their time.  If someone chooses to write free software,
</I>&gt;<i> that's great, but there is nothing wrong with being compensated for one's
</I>&gt;<i> work.  There is nothing shameful or selfish in that whatsoever.  What's
</I>&gt;<i> shameful is making demands on someone who has already given generously to
</I>&gt;<i> the community, as if he hasn't done enough already.
</I>
I agree completely, except the first sentence. Do you really think
nothing whatsoever is wrong with society?

&gt;<i> This implies that some sort of blame exists.
</I>
No, it doesn't. If I were to say you are &quot;not a crook&quot;, does that
&quot;imply&quot; that you are &quot;some sort of crook&quot;?

I'm not suggesting that C++ should drop support for RAII. I'm saying  
it's stupid that it doesn't also support finally.

C++ is about making it easier to write complex code. It can be argued  
that it's syntactic sugar (as is any language). Not supporting finally  
means often times forcing the user to write more code, not less, to  
accomplish a thing.

I also love Java, and wish it supported RAII (but not at the expense  
of finally). There's no reason not to have both.

<PRE>Hi,

I am new to antlr and I am writing a scripting language (in antlr v3) 
which looks similar to java, with simple loop commands, if statement, 
basic type, arrays etc. I am able to write the parser (though facing 
problem at the AST side but I'll figure that out).  

My problem is that, this script would be loosely coupled with another 
application written in java and I would like to use the classes 
written there. So in a way, my script won&#146;t allow the user to 
explicitly call classes but would itself internally use classes from 
the other application as required. Also I do not want the user to 
compile the script, that should happen only at runtime (would love if 
compilation to byte-code can be avoided) and execute the script step 
by step. 

I would also like to develop a simple editor (but with Intellisence) 
for this. Could anyone please provide me little guidance on this? I 
tried searching for material that might help me but failed to find 
much of use (possibly I am looking at wrong places).

Thanks,
Raj

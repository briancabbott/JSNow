Sorry but you're on your own there. Not supported in C++, too many
hacks/bad choices in the generated code and support lib that may bite you.
YMMV. Keep phonenumber of shrink at hand for support.

(Just to make clear you're preparing for headaches)

&gt;<i> Seems from the doc that Antlr isn't really ready to deal with the full

</I>&gt;<i> EOF (integer -1, typecast to 0xFFFF as a character), problems with
</I>&gt;<i> character sets (getting very large), and it seems that it assumes that

</I>
Well the C++ stuff truncates to 8 bits whenever it sees fit. Nothing 16 bit
there except for an unlucky signextension here and there due to people
using int's where unsigneds should be used.

&gt;<i> So, rather than try to work around or fix these problems, I intend to

</I>&gt;<i> easy for us, since the the process feeding the source stream already
</I>&gt;<i> normalizes the incoming character set to UTF-8.)
</I>
This is an approach you might get away with though. But things might bite
you here and there.

&gt;<i> We'd be parsing the UTF-8 encoded version of these characters:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> NAME_START_CHAR:
</I>&gt;<i>      ':' | 'A'..'Z' | '_' | 'a'..'z'
</I>&gt;<i>      | '\u00C3' '\u0080'..'\u0096'           // '\u00C0'-'\u00D6'
</I>&gt;<i>      | '\u00C3' '\u0098'..'\u00B6'           // '\u00D8'-'\u00F6'
</I>&gt;<i>      | '\u00C3' '\u00B8'..'\u00BF'           // '\u00F8'-'\u00FF'
</I>&gt;<i>      | '\u00C4'..'\u00CB' '\u0080'..'\u00BF' // '\u0100'-'\u02FF'
</I>&gt;<i>      | '\u00CD' '\u00B0'..'\u00BD'           // '\u0370'-'\u037D'
</I>&gt;<i>      | '\u00CD' '\u00BF'                     // '\u037F'
</I>&gt;<i>      | '\u00CE'..'\u00DF' '\u0080'..'\u00BF' // '\u0380'-'\u07FF'
</I>&gt;<i>      | '\u00E0' '\u00A0'..'\u00BF' '\u0080'..'\u00BF'    //
</I>&gt;<i> '\u0800'-'\u0FFF'
</I>&gt;<i>      | '\u00E1' '\u0090'..'\u00BF' '\u0080'..'\u00BF'    //
</I>&gt;<i> '\u1000'-'\u1FFF'
</I>&gt;<i>      ... and so on ...
</I>&gt;<i>      ;
</I>
Note that 2.7.4 will barf out attempts at 16 bit char constants. 2.7.3 will
at times do a sign extension if you're unlucky (but should be safe most of
the time or alternative constructions available for.

&gt;<i> Does anyone see any pitfalls to this other than increasing the look
</I>&gt;<i> ahead for the lexer?
</I>
See first part of reply. Keep a debugger at hand + the antlr source + your
favourite text editor.

&gt;<i> Since in our source language, all the meaningful punctuation is in the
</I>&gt;<i> visible US-ASCII range, the only place the difference between parsing
</I>&gt;<i> Unicode characters vs. UTF-8 encoded Unicode characters would be in things
</I>&gt;<i> like the NAME token production.
</I>
If you trick antlr to make the right bitsets, you may get away by
handcoding/modifying the few rules that need to deal with UTF8 multibyte
sequences. The moment you put the icky bits in nice 8 bit strings you're
basically homefree except for sorting out the actual lenghts of the text
etc. You could get away with redefining the strings in antlr to wchars and
recompiling a hacked version of the support lib to have a bit more 'room'
to maneuver (sp?). That has been done before with some luck.

&gt;<i> This seems much more preferable to me than extending the C++ support
</I>&gt;<i> with some Unicode library (like IBM's icu or some such).
</I>
I commend you if you do it with the current support lib (in both cases ;) )

Might be preferable over reinventing the wheel though. And for me a lot
quicker to implement stuff (unless there's volunteers out there?).

Lucky lucky ;)

Erm this means I'm added to your pester list &lt;shudders-in-horror&gt;. Shoot it

If you're lucky.

&gt;<i> No, it is not.  U+10FFFF is (Since Unicode 3.1).  Yup, 21 bits.
</I>
And I also wonder what you'll get if you feed the lexer in java mode a
sequence that contains such a value broken up over two UTF-16 values (that
for lexer terms should be treated as one!). So I don't think even Java mode
is safe from headaches. The lexer has to be unicode aware (in a sense this
might be nice since there's than a chance of sharing more code between the
different target languages ;) )

If you're not feeding it complete unicode input ;) and restrict it to plain
character ASCII kindoff stuff you should have no problem ;) In general one
big *no*.

Which means you're out of luck, sadly.

Options:
- Hack around things and create a maintenance nightmare (most probable).
- Find (handcode) a different lexer but probably you'll have to tinker a bit with the
  support lib.
- Don't use ANTLR.

Cheers,

Ric

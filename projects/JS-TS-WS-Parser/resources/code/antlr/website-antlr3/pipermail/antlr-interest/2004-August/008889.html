I'm just avoiding the problem!  I'm not going to put in any &quot;!&quot; into
the parser.  I guess you could merge them in with the hiddenTokens,
but I didn't want mix real tokens with whitespace/comments and I
didn't see a nice way to override the &quot;!&quot;.  My plan is to make a new
base AST that will have just &quot;right&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, a simple string for the
&quot;hiddenAfter&quot; (or maybe a byte array or even do some huffman
encoding), so putting real token text in the hiddenAfter strings
probably wouldn't be a good idea.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sibling pointer.  With AST nodes like that, these rules:

</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, double link would be nice.
</I>
A bidirectional link list for the children would be another solution -
just point the root to the point in the list where it was removed.  I
was talking about having the root point to 2 unidirectional link lists
of children - left list and right list.

<PRE>Oops ... and another quicky that may be useful to me ...

If I don't want to eat up the newline at the end, is the following
likely to be a good/sensible parser rule?

commentst : REMARK ( (LA(1) != newline) =&gt; . )* ;

in other words, having found a REMARK, eat everything up to but not
including the next newline. Or is LA a lexer-only thing as well?

Cheers,
Wol

Thanks. That's pretty much what I was looking for. Now I merely have to
understand it :-)

And it's even the case that I'm writing a grammar for the same language
:<i>-) although a different dialect. I don't know if you remember Rob's
</I>example of a program with all the varying usages of REM? A *nightmare*
(and the one I'm trying to deal with :-) but using a different technique
to him.

Note for Ter - if you haven't saved that post, go look it up. It'd be
nice if Antlr had some way of trying to cope - it's a perfect example of
something that a lexer/parser could handle pretty easily, but a separate
lexer and parser would have nightmares over...

Cheers,
Wol

Hi,

filter=&lt;rule&gt; only works in lexers AFAIK.

&gt;<i> I want to filter the token stream coming out of the lexer (and I can't

</I>.)
&gt;<i> newline)
</I>
So to put it in parser Lingo:

(NEWLINE | SEMI) (&quot;rem&quot; | &quot;*&quot; | &quot;!&quot;) ~( &quot;=&quot;| &quot;(&quot; ) ( {greedy=false} . )

There's only a set of closures missing by the looks of it ?

Looks like Monty's filter example might be usefull...

<A HREF="http://www.codetransform.com/filterexample.html">http://www.codetransform.com/filterexample.html</A>

&gt;<i> eating everything EXCEPT the newline, which needs to be passed through
</I>&gt;<i> to the parser. Note also, that while &quot;*&quot; and &quot;!&quot; are tokens, &quot;rem&quot; is
</I>an
&gt;<i> ident. 
</I>
So it's:

(NEWLINE | SEMI) (rem:ID | &quot;*&quot; | &quot;!&quot;) ~( &quot;=&quot;| &quot;(&quot; ) ( {greedy=false} . )

&gt;<i> Of course, if I need &quot;rem&quot; to be a token, presumably if this rule
</I>&gt;<i> fails I can convert it back to an ident?
</I>
Should be possible to modify the ident to a REM token I guess.

I guess I'd handwrite a small parser for the above might be simpler than
coaxing antlr in doing it. Although I'm not sure you migth get away with
some semantic predicate fun.

&gt;<i> Or do I need to write my own token stream to do this (if so, where do
</I>I
&gt;<i> look for an example?)
</I>
See the link to Monty's site.

Cheers,

Ric

  &quot;I think we better split up.&quot;
  &quot;Good idea. We can do more damage that way.&quot;

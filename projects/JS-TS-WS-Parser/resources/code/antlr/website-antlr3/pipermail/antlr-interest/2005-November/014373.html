<PRE>Hello,

Obviosuly you haven't read my previous postings on this: I have said
that I will post an example of the problem WHEN I am able to produce a
small case that shows the problem and WHEN I have the time for it on my
project: My clients are NOT paying me to post bug reports to you. Surely
you know how that works.

Who said I am taking the ANTLR team for gratnted ? As a matter of fact,
I have on several occasions thanked Terrence for bringing this great
tool to the community.

However, none of this fixes the bug. It is wasted bandwith on this
forum.

Geir

I've been using ANTLR a bit longer than you, and my
perception is different.

If you're a developer with any significant experience
I'd expect you to know the basics of QA process.

While logging a bug one is supposed to give
description of the problem with a test case in which
bug is at least sometimes reproducible.

This has been iterated again and again, many people
think it is an interesting and priority bug, *if* it
infact exists. So far you have not provided any inputs
to demonstrate it is there!

Understand that its hard to look for a something if
you dont even know how it looks like or if its infact
there.

Oh, and taking people who work for nothing and provide
a tool of this quality, for granted, *is NOT polite*.
If you can't invest time to come up with a testcase
how do you expect people to spend their time hunting
down something that may or may not be there just
because someone sent a feedback 'hey I think its
there!'

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just one more comment on this Bug. It is **
</I>&gt;<i> clearly ** a bug, since
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ANTLR does work correctly when BitSets are NOT
</I>&gt;<i> used.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, it could be just a limitation, perhaps catered
</I>&gt;<i> for with a few
</I>&gt;<i> tweaks, or perhaps better addressed with efforts in
</I>&gt;<i> the Antlr 3 space.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I find it strange
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that this Bug  seems to be passed in almost
</I>&gt;<i> silence: I would think it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;to  be rather serious to have a &quot;sleeping&quot; bug that
</I>&gt;<i> may come and bite
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;you  any time you encounter the right conditions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Terrence asked me to try to produce a small
</I>&gt;<i> grammar example to try to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reproduce the problem. I will as soon as time on
</I>&gt;<i> my project permits
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmmm - I thought you said it was a serious bug?
</I>&gt;<i> Can't be THAT serious
</I>&gt;<i> can it? ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BUT I would think it is equally IMPORTANT for the
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR team to try to
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hunt down this ** serious ** bug. It is nice that
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR 3.0 is under
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; development, but we sure need a strong ** core **
</I>&gt;<i> technology that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; won't fail.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, the last time I was there I noticed that beer
</I>&gt;<i> and pizza were
</I>&gt;<i> significantly more expensive in San Francsico than
</I>&gt;<i> most other parts of
</I>&gt;<i> the world except Geneva. I am sure that donating a
</I>&gt;<i> few vouchers for same
</I>&gt;<i> would make this bug very much more important.
</I>&gt;<i> Remember that it is free
</I>&gt;<i> (for you anyway) and we should be careful to give
</I>&gt;<i> out a bit of respect
</I>&gt;<i> for people's time and efforts given freely :-).

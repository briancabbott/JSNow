Well, top down recognizers have the advantage (well recursive-descent 
LL anyway) that you can define locals and such and pass parameters 
easily to rules.  Actions need access to these things and moving 
actions into another method somewhere makes this much harder.  This is 
one reason why I don't like this &quot;event model&quot; type action placement.

&gt;<i> This seems like a good way to handle the first issue you raised which

It is one way, but I'm mainly talking about standard actions like 
'build tree node' not translation actions.

&gt;<i> The tricky part is the &quot;predicate standard actions&quot;?  By this I'm
</I>&gt;<i> assuming you mean things like disambiguation of symbols vs. keywords by

</I>
Something like that or python's messy lexer that needs to decide when 
to ignore NEWLINES etc...

&gt;<i>  It seems like this would be nearly impossible
</I>&gt;<i> to make target language neutral.  Taking the ideas from SLK a step
</I>&gt;<i> further, perhaps you could have a different notation for semantic
</I>&gt;<i> predicates (which should return a Boolean type in the target language)
</I>&gt;<i> from actions.
</I>
I've thought that perhaps standard actions go in {...} and language 
specific actions go in &lt;&lt;...&gt;&gt;.  Just a thought.

Thanks,
Ter

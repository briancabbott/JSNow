<PRE>Actually PCCTS did full LL at one method per rule, and ANTLR 3 should as well.  ANTLR 2 did not implement some important features 
of PCCTS--most notably full LL analysis/code generation and semantic predicate hoisting.  ANTLR 2 was a &quot;rush to market&quot; job while 
Ter was busy starting up jGuru.  At the time, Sriram Srinivasan had started work on JavaCC and was basing the design on PCCTS, 
albeit with some more &quot;conservative&quot; features like parse trees instead of ANTLR-style syntax trees.  Ter had just decided on Java as 
an implementation language after playing around with Sather and some others--by that time, he had developed a passionate dislike of 
C++.

That said, multiple methods per rule would be an internal refactoring of a grammar.  I've given some (not nearly enough) thought to 
grammar refactoring and can identify a few cases.  My bias is to think of tree grammar refactorings, but the current set of possible 
refactorings that I have identified includes (paired, for symmetry):

iteration to recursion (often necessary when using synpreds to determine exits from ()* loops)
recursion to iteration

left factoring
syntactic predication

subrule hoisting (pushing dangling alternatives &quot;upwards&quot;)
subrule internment (converse)

rule/subrule replication (often necessary to insert different action sets)
rule/subrule consolidation (a good design of tree grammars often leads to simplification by consolidation--requires care in annotating 
the parser or preceding tree grammars)

inlining of rules (demotion of rule to subrule)
promotion of subrule to rule.

I'd like to build up a reasonably comprehensive list of these--automation assistance for refactoring is an obvious feature to incorporate 
into a workbench.  Anyone have any additions to suggest?

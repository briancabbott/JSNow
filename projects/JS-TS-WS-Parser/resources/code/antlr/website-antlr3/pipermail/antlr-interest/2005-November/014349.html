Hooray!

&gt;<i> FYI I noticed that Todd King recently posted an updated C# grammar

</I>
I don't see his email anywhere so might be hard to contact him.

&gt;&gt;<i> I'll be doing an auto-converter to 3.0.  Current version I just   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> released is pretty usable if you ask me, but I'm going to try it  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out  on a real app soon to see if it does anything useful.  It  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crashes on  bad input at the moment etc...  I wouldn't bet my job  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on it yet ;)   3.0 eta will be next summer probably.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I took a look at the 3.0 examples and this new design really does

</I>&gt;<i> genuinely innovative work, and I think your approach to the problem  
</I>&gt;<i> is right on.  I'm really looking forward to this release, and will  
</I>&gt;<i> give the &quot;early access&quot; build a try as soon as the C# codegen is in  
</I>&gt;<i> place.  Anyway, thanks for your help!

My pleasure.  Thanks for the nice words.  I've been collecting ideas  
from people for years and forging them into a single coherent theme  
for v3.  Some of the stuff is really crazy cool like the rewrite from  
grammar to tree grammar for tree construction.  It's been a mad rush  
for 2.5 years, 3 by the time I finish.  With the addition of tools  
like ANTLRWorks and ANTLRStudio, I think making languages/data  
translators etc... will be much easier. :)

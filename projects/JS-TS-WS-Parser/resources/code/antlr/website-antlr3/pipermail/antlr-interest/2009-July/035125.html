</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> It will require a huge amount of work since all the stmGroup's are
</I>&gt;<i> quite large and complex themselves. Also it will make the grammar
</I>&gt;<i> almost unreadable.

I think you will find that it doesn't result in an readable grammar in  
fact. Formatting is your friend here.

I keep trying to influence people to practice by presenting an  
approach to writing such grammars. But I think people basically  
download Works and start typing. There are lots of posts about left  
factoring, not using backtrack and so on. Basically the normative spec  
is rarely written with the parser programmer in mind and you must  
interpolate.

Generally you can get backtrack to work as you want but with terrible  
error messages. If you can't then I would suggest starting again and  
use the recommended incremental approach to building grammars. You  
already have a lexer so you can cut and paste parser pieces until you  
get it correct.

</I>&gt;<i> An example of a problematic rule is:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.trex.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/trac/wiki/ttcn-3_4.0.4#FunctionStatement">http://www.trex.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/trac/wiki/ttcn-3_4.0.4#FunctionStatement</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These are two parts of that problem:
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; ConfigurationStatements -&gt; StartTCStatement
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; TimerStatements -&gt; StartTimerStatement
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS. backtrack is not used at all in the grammar.

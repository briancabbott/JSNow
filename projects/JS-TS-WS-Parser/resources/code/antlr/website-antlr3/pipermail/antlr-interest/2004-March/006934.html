The issue could be that C++ / C header files are a poor mechanism in 
general for factoring stuff due to very coarse granularity of 
dependencies.  Can you suggest some factoring tips?

[Side note from an anti-C++ bigot: I can't believe people don't 
complain about the complete lack of portability of C++.  Never once 
have I heard people say that the Java code won't compile somewhere 
(course the build process is a different story perhaps&lt;wink&gt;).  It is 
truly astounding that nearly 20 years after the first lecture I heard 
on C++, we still don't have a portable language.  Stroustroup (SP?) is 
coming to USF to speak soon...I'll try to leave my heavier projectiles 
at home.] ;) :D  Just my opinion folks ;)

&gt;<i> That's my number one beef. The other thing I ran into is that it was

Hooray!

&gt;<i> Considering those are my major complaints, it seems I've been pretty

Yeah!  Thanks, Braden...

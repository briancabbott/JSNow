Generally speaking, when writing a tree grammar rule you put the 
action to be executed at the end of the rule.  This means that it 
has already seen both terms in the AST, so there's no lookahead 
involved here.  You merely need some way to identify the type of 
each term (which is trivial in the above case, and only slightly 
more complicated in the cases where the terms can be 
sub-ASTs/expressions).

Of course, this approach only works for a strongly typed language 
(ie. one where variables are typed, so that you can statically 
determine whether a given variable name contains a string or an 
integer).  If your language is dynamically typed then you'll have 
to have your runtime multiplication operation work out what types 
its arguments are and how to deal with them accordingly.

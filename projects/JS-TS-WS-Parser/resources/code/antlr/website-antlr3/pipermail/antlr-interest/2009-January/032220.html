<PRE>==========================================================================
Call for Papers for the Fourteenth IEEE International Conference on
        Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS09)
                          www.iceccs.org
==========================================================================

The goal of ICECCS is to bring together industrial, academic, and
government experts, from a variety of user domains and software
disciplines, to determine how the disciplines' problems and solution
techniques interact within the whole system.
Researchers, practitioners, tool developers and users, and technology
transition experts are all welcome.
The scope of interest includes long-term research issues, near-term
complex system requirements and promising tools, existing complex systems,
and commercially available tools.


Scope and Topics
----------------
Papers are solicited in all areas related to complex computer-based
systems, including the causes of complexity and means of avoiding,
controlling, or coping with complexity.
Topic areas include, but are not limited to:

-Avionics and Automobile Software
-Content Production and Distribution Systems, Mobile and Multi-channel
Systems
-Context Awareness Computing
-Engineering of Complex Interactive Computer Systems
-Formal Methods and Approaches to Manage and Control Complex Systems
-Human Factors and Collaborative Aspects
-Integration of Heterogeneous Technologies
-Interoperability and Standardization
-Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing
-Real-time and Embedded Systems
-Sensor Network Systems and Applications
-Software and System Development and Control Processes for Complex Systems
-Software Architecture and System Engineering
-Software Complexity Visualization
-Systems and Software Safety and Security
-Tools, Environments, and Languages for Complex Systems
-Verification Techniques for Complex Software Systems
-Virtual Environments for Managing Complexity
-Web Services Modeling and Compositions

Different kinds of contributions are sought, including research papers,
Lessons learned, status reports, and discussion of practical problems
faced by industry and user domains.
The ultimate goal is to build a rich and comprehensive conference program
that can fit the interests and needs of different classes of attendees:
professionals, researchers, managers, and students. A program goal is to
organize several sessions that include both academic and industrial papers
on a given topic and culminate panels to discuss relationships between
industrial and academic research.
Papers are divided into two categories: Technical Papers and Experience
Reports. The papers submitted to both categories will be reviewed by
program committee members, and papers accepted in either category will be
published in the conference proceedings.
Technical papers should describe original research, and industrial
experience reports should describe practical projects carried out in
industry, and reflect on the lessons learnt from them.


Paper Submission
----------------
Submitted manuscripts should be in English and formatted in the style of
the IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Format:
(<A HREF="ftp://pubftp.computer.org/press/outgoing/proceedings/instruct.doc">ftp://pubftp.computer.org/press/outgoing/proceedings/instruct.doc</A>).
Papers should not exceed 10 pages including figures, references, and
appendices and be in PDF format. Submissions of papers will be carried out
electronically via the Web:

<A HREF="http://sttt.cs.uni-dortmund.de/iceccs09/servlet/Conference">http://sttt.cs.uni-dortmund.de/iceccs09/servlet/Conference</A>

Authors of accepted papers will be required to sign a copyright release
form. IEEE Computer Society Press will publish the proceedings. Final
versions of accepted papers will be limited
to 10 pages in the aforementioned IEEE proceedings format.


Important Dates
-------------
Submission deadline -  2 February, 2009
Start of reviews - 4 February, 2009
Review Deadline - 24 February, 2009
Notification of acceptance - 2 March, 2009

<PRE>

Anakreon,

Thanks for the help. Thanks to your code, I think I
finally see why I'm seeing things differently....

You basically invoke code at the start and/or end of
each visit to each tree node. For example, you have this
in js_tree.g:

  | #(WHILE &lt;pre_while&gt; expr statement &lt;post_while&gt;)

...and this in js_tree_php.act:

@pre_while : { incLabels(); }
@post_while : { decLabels(); }

Most of these chunks of code are just a few lines, with
a few a bit larger (@assign is 50 lines, for example).
About 800 lines in total of automatically-fired-by-treewalker
code.

Why Am I seeing things diffently from (most) everyone else here?
Wthen I look at my rules, and ask &quot;how would he do that?&quot;
and the answer is almost always &quot;he wouldn't&quot;. My translator
is not just translating the core language, but the core libraries
too. And the translations are not just simple syntactics,
they're high-level rewrites.

Just to pick one example, many C functions return error codes.
For example, fopen() returns a 0 if it can't open a file.
That needs to be replaced with exception handling in Java.
So I have a list of the functions and the values they return
on error. I check for calls to the functions, and look for
various patterns of error checking, such as:
-----------------------------
if (fopen(xxx) == 0) { // return value checked
// error code
}
else {
// non-error code
}
-----------------------------
v = fopen(xxx); // return value stored and checked later
...
if (v != 0) {
// non-error code
}
-----------------------------

And once I've found one of these patterns, I store the
&quot;error code&quot; and &quot;non-error code&quot; (both of which may be more
than just an AST, they are a sequence of statements),
and produce the corresponding try/catch block in Java.
And, if there are several statements that may throw
the same exception, we don't want this:
try {
  open();
} catch(IOException e) {
  // error code
}
try {
  read();
} catch(IOException e) {
  // error code again!
}

So, I've got to do some real work to figure out where to
put the try/catch stuff.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think your translator
is doing anything nearly that complex. I have many simple
syntactic rules as you do, but I also have many complex 
rules like this one.

So, now that I think about it,
maybe even this one rule involves several things that you probably
wouldn't see in your typical language-to-language translator:

* handling of library functions, not just core language
* replacing whole mechanisms/paradigms (error codes from 
  library functions being replaced by exception handling)
* complex pattern matching (e.g. checking for various comparisons
  the return value like ==, !=, &lt;, etc. and even checking for
  storage in a variable and then usage of that variable)

In case you think that this rule is just an exceptionally
complex one, here are a few other examples:

* structs, unions, and enums become whole Java classes, including
  constructors and changes at each reference
* memory management is done &quot;by hand&quot; in C must be changed to
  use Java objects.
* I handle multiple input files, and change C file names
  to Java ones (including combining &quot;hello.c&quot; and &quot;hello.h&quot; into
  &quot;Hello.java&quot;
* There are different rules in Java and C for where an array
  can be initialized.
* The syntax and semantics for array declaration are different
  (In C, it's &quot;struct person a[3];&quot;, in Java it's 
   &quot;Person a[] = new Person[3];&quot; plus a loop to initialize it)

Those are just some of my rules that start with &quot;A&quot;
(AddClassRule, AddConstructorRule, ApplicationFileRenameRule,
ArrayInitializerRule, ArrayDeclarationRule).

Now I'm really starting to wonder about how much all the
language-to-language translators out there are really doing.
I know for a fact that the C-to-Java ones (other than Jazillian)
are only doing trivial syntactic changes
(see <A HREF="http://jazillian.com/competition.html">http://jazillian.com/competition.html</A> for details).

What's the most complex translator that that people
have seen? (Complex meaning functionality, not internals).

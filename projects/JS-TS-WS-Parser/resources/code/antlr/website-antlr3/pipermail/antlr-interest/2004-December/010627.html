<PRE>

I came across this item and thought Terence and others
might find it interesting, considering that ANTLR 3 is
generating Java bytecode:

<A HREF="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/08/DynamicJava">http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/08/DynamicJava</A>

Apparently, the gurus for a bunch of dynamic languages
(Perl, Parrot, Python, Groovy) had a little meeting at
Sun, and one thing they came away with had to do with
bytecode generation. To quote the article:

Lesson: Bytecode Generation A lot of people these days are generating
bytecode: not just Jython and Groovy, but AOP tools and XPath/XSLT
tools and others too. They're all doing it by hand without any
abstractions to help, and it's difficult and messy and they're
probably not doing that great a job. &#182;

So it would be super-handy for a lot of people if there were a
higher-level approach to this, perhaps at the AST level, so you could
automate the bytecode generation for some common idioms like switches
and loops and so on. It's trickier than you might think, since the
semantics of something as apparently simple as assignment to a
variable can get very complex in a dynamic language.

Janino looks interesting in this respect, and some of the work in Kawa
might be re-usable, and over in .NET-land there is this thing called
the CodeDom which is apparently addressing a similar problem. So maybe
the right thing would be a java.net project to build some shared
infrastructure in this space.

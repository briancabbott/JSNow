<PRE>I've been using Google Talk and thought you might like to try it out.
We can use it to call each other for free over the internet. Here's an
invitation to download Google Talk. Give it a try!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Piyush Daftary wants to stay in better touch using some of Google's coolest new
products.

If you already have Gmail or Google Talk, visit:
<A HREF="http://mail.google.com/mail/b-5384c98730-a793684b20-9XpLv14xw_4RLldbJJA3n5Bcl7k">http://mail.google.com/mail/b-5384c98730-a793684b20-9XpLv14xw_4RLldbJJA3n5Bcl7k</A>
You'll need to click this link to be able to chat with Piyush Daftary.

To get Gmail - a free email account from Google with over 2,800 megabytes of
storage - and chat with Piyush Daftary, visit:
<A HREF="http://mail.google.com/mail/a-5384c98730-a793684b20-9XpLv14xw_4RLldbJJA3n5Bcl7k">http://mail.google.com/mail/a-5384c98730-a793684b20-9XpLv14xw_4RLldbJJA3n5Bcl7k</A>

Gmail offers:
- Instant messaging right inside Gmail
- Powerful spam protection
- Built-in search for finding your messages and a helpful way of organizing
  emails into &quot;conversations&quot;
- No pop-up ads or untargeted banners - just text ads and related information
  that are relevant to the content of your messages

All this, and its yours for free. But wait, there's more! By opening a Gmail
account, you also get access to Google Talk, Google's instant messaging
service:

<A HREF="http://www.google.com/talk/">http://www.google.com/talk/</A>

Google Talk offers:
- Web-based chat that you can use anywhere, without a download
- A contact list that's synchronized with your Gmail account
- Free, high quality PC-to-PC voice calls when you download the Google Talk
  client

We're working hard to add new features and make improvements, so we might also
ask for your comments and suggestions periodically. We appreciate your help in
making our products even better!

Thanks,
The Google Team

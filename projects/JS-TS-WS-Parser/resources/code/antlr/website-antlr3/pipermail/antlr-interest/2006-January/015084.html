Hello Martin,

Thanks for the feedback; comments below.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> the parser.
</I>
I guess it depends on what you mean by &quot;special&quot;.  If I understand antlr 
correctly, &quot;protected&quot; rules are not merely internal: most importantly 
&quot;evaluation&quot; (so to speak) works differently for spliced v. tokenizing 
rules.  Spliced rules don't tokenize.  By &quot;tokenizing&quot; I mean the result 
of matching the subrule is bound to a token rather than being spliced. 
So one could also specify a difference in scoping, e.g. matching of a 
tokenizing subrule occurs in a local scope, whereas a spliced subrule is 
matched in the scope of the rule that does the splicing.

This is basically a variation on how macros and splicing works in 
Lisp/Scheme, which is why it is so useful.  Much of its usefulness is 
simply that it makes the language more expressive.

In fact, with splicing notation, we could allow a rule to be both 
tokenizing and non-tokenizing.  E.g.

	,A = ....  // splicing (non-tokenizing) and internal only
	FOO = (X Y Z)  // bisemous(?): hoisted to nextToken, but may be spliced too
	BAR = B FOO C    // delegation to tokenizing rule FOO
	BAZ = I ,FOO J   // splice non-tokenizing FOO
	BUZ = Q A R	// error? delegation to splice-only rule

  The calling rule doesn't care about the fact, it just says
&gt;<i> &quot;and at this point, I need the stuff defined in FOO&quot;.
</I>
It makes a difference whether or not &quot;the stuff defined in FOO&quot; is 
&quot;tokenized&quot; or spliced.  That's why IMO an explicit splicing operator is 
a good thing.  It allows the designer a degree of control over 
tokenizing, and it helps the reader understand the intention of the writer.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Plus: it does not have the properties of a macro expansion, does it? And
</I>&gt;<i> if so: who cares? That's IMHO an implementation detail - from the
</I>&gt;<i> language point of view it's just a sequence of matches.
</I>
Well, my thinking about &quot;splice&quot; and &quot;macro&quot; is inspired by scheme, but 
isn't quite the same.  I think of splicing in antlr (&quot;calling&quot; a 
protected subtemplate) as equivalent to referencing a #defined 
identifier in C.  (This may not be entirely accurate, but it's my 
understanding of the 2.7.5 documentation.)  There's a big difference 
indeed between expanding a macro and evaluation an expression.  If you 
splice a rule (expand a macro), you first construct the text by merging 
(a purely syntactic operation, no matching/eval/etc.), and the result is 
another piece of grammar to be matched.  But if you delegate, you first 
do the matches (in a new local scope), then tokenize the result (bind it 
to a single token) which is inserted.  So the components are *not* 
inserted into the syntax.

In a word, you end up with different token structures depending on 
whether you splice or delegate.  At least that's the idea.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd propose to call those rules &quot;internal&quot; - as stated, they cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> directly accessed from outside of the Lexer (in the rule matching
</I>&gt;<i> meaning) and &quot;internal&quot; also expresses the Java protected behaviour.
</I>
Internal/external, hidden/exposed, etc. - that's all distinct from the 
core issue of splicing v. tokenizing, no?  Which might be construed more 
usefully as syntactic v. semantic splicing.  I suppose one might argue 
that the internal/external distinction is itself an irrelevant 
implementation detail - what counts is tokenizing.

Thanks,

gregg

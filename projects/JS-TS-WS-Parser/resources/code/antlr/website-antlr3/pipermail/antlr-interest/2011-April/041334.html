<PRE>Hi Sam 

&gt;<i> Edit: I misread the original email, but I'm still sending this because 
</I>&gt;<i> it resolves the warning given on the rule y. 
</I>
;-) Yeah that much is clear, I also fully understand the crazyness of not left-factoring rule &quot;start&quot; into (y C?)+ EOF; 

Just was wondering why the warning on rule &quot;start&quot; as it stands below, I was expecting ANTLR to &quot;auto-left-factor&quot; with the prediction dfa and don&#180;t quite understand why it does not on this occasion. 

Thanks 
Peter 

&gt;<i> Consider the input 'ba', starting with the rule start. It could parse as 
</I>&gt;<i> (y y EOF), with the first y matching B without the A, and the second 
</I>&gt;<i> matching just A. It could also parse as (y EOF), with the first y 
</I>&gt;<i> matching B and the optional A. 
</I>
&gt;<i> If you mean for y to always include the A when present, you can use 
</I>&gt;<i> a syntactic predicate, which forces it to choose the second 
</I>&gt;<i> interpretation above: 
</I>
&gt;<i> y : B ((A) =&gt; A)? | A;

Subject: [antlr-interest] Why is this ambiguous.. 

Hello, 

While working on a grammar I had something that boils down to 

grammar T; 
start: (y | y C)+ EOF; 
y: B (A)? | A; 

A : 'a'; 
B : 'b'; 
C : 'c'; 

This gives an expected warning on rule y, that's fine, ANTLR does the right 
thing and matches A greedily. 
However it also gives a warning on rule start: 

T.g:2:19: Decision can match input such as &quot;B {EOF, B..A}&quot; using multiple 
alternatives: 1, 2 
As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input 

I quite understand the need to left factor this, I was just wondering why 
ANTLR gives this warning. It must be staring me in the face but I don't see 
it... 
How is this non-deterministic on input B EOF? Is ANTLR unable to see past 
rule y for some reason? 

Thanks 
Peter

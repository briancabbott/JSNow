<PRE>Hi,

Well I was planning to do some major surgery anyway ;)

First step custom would be adding a custom new/delete. Then problably do or
a subclassing trick, or some template trick to select the desired memory
pool (and/or the Boehm GC, I'm btw not sure how well the Boehm GC handles
circular things...). Lately I've been experimenting with a memory pool
implementation found in the Efficient C++ book from Bulka and Mayhew.

&gt;<i> Were you planning to eliminate RefToken and RefAST by replacing them with
</I>&gt;<i> pointers?
</I>
At least RefAST would dissappear it's causing most 'problems' (or kludges)
and indeed it would become a plain old pointer. RefToken is less
troublesome (no heterogenous tokens and stuff like that).

&gt;<i> There's another option for my specific needs. There's a style of reference

</I>&gt;<i> for the hidden tokens, I would have to hack or replace one or two chunks of
</I>&gt;<i> the Antlr library.
</I>
Can't you use your own flavour of hidden tokens? I just had a small look at
the current implementation and I think it can be changed a little to solve
the reference counting problem. (basically play dirty in a few places and
store pointers to the objects in stead of using the RefToken) 

Or do it less dirty and use a single linked list of visible tokens and in
the visible tokens you store a vector (or single linked list) with all
hidden tokens before/after the visible one. I don't see why a double linked
list is necessary there (probably there because of direct port from java).

Another possibility is adding a custom new/delete to the hidden token
implementation. Allocate them from a pool attach the pool to the
lexer/parser and delete the pool with the lexer/parser object.

If you switch to another scheme of reference counting (you btw got a reference
on that style of ref counting?) you may have to do some antlr surgery.

HTH,

Ric

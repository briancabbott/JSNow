What is the in situ Java replacement for &quot;memcpy(a, b, c);&quot;?
How about &quot;char *p&quot;? Is the replacement a String, an array of chars, a 
LinkedList of Character,
or maybe an integer index into an array?
How about replacing 10 lines of C code that clearly can be replaced by a 
single call to Collections.sort()?

If you're going to have a translation that &quot;works&quot; - has identical 
functionality as the original, the
answers may be straightforward. But if you are going to produce code 
that looks &quot;hand-written&quot;
(whether identical functionality or not), you're
going to have to take a good look around at the code in order to decide 
what should be produced.

If someone's covered these issues in the literature and I just missed 
it, let me know.

Andy

<PRE>Thanks Monty!
 
I used references to down and right because those are the member
variables used within the AST reference (as seen in debugger) to denote
child and sibling respectively.  Maybe that is why I get so confused. 
The docs refer to child/sibling, but actual code uses down/right.  Your
solution looks cleaner than mine (I finally got mine to work - FWIW)
shown below for your entertainment ;-).

 catchBlock!
  { AST temp = null, parent = null;
  } :
  ( idCATCH:CATCH LPAREN! eType:identifier eID:IDENTIFIER RPAREN!
catchBody:block 
  { temp = #(null, #idCATCH, #eType, #eID, #catchBody); 
   
   if (#catchBlock == null)
    #catchBlock = temp;
   
   if (parent != null)
    parent.addChild(temp);
 
   parent = temp;    
  }
  )+
  ;

- Is ## shorthand for #&lt;rulename&gt;?  
 
- Is the &quot;()+&quot; notation on your catchBlock rule a typo?  I would think
the only one I would need to keep is on the catchBlocks rule.
 
- Won't using the imaginary token build a tree like:
 
CATCH_BLOCK--&gt;CATCH_BLOCK--&gt;(another CATCH_BLOCK, etc.)
   |
CATCH
   |
   v
Exception1--(right)--&gt;e1--(right)--&gt;block--(right)--&gt;null

Is there any way to use the CATCH token in the same manner as the
CATCH_BLOCK imaginary token and in effect, remove the extra node?  
 
Thanks again!

That's an unusual tree structure, it's like you have down and right
mixed
up.  Think siblings and children.  All the catch blocks would be
siblings,
right?  I would recommend something like:

idCatch--(right)--&gt; (another idCatch, etc.)
   |
(down)
   |
   v
Exception1--(right)--&gt;e1--(right)--&gt;block--(right)--&gt;null

The code:

statement :
   TRY^ block catchBlocks 
      (idFINALLY:FINALLY! finallyBlock:block!
       {## = #(##,#(idFINALLY,#finallyBlock))} )?
   ;

catchBlocks :
    (catchBlock)+
    {##=#(#[CATCH_BLOCK],##);}
    ;

catchBlock:
   (CATCH^ LPAREN! identifier IDENTIFIER RPAREN! block
   )+
   ;

Also, try using toStringList() to print out your tree, you'll get a
better
idea of the structure that way.

catchBlocks uses a standard tree building idiom to root a tree with an
imaginary node (which you'll define in your tokens{} section)

Note I split your catchBlock rule into two rules to be able to easily
build
the tree I want to build.  I could have done the same with the
&quot;finally&quot;
block part of &quot;statement&quot; too.

Subject: [antlr-interest] AST generation in a recursive rule

Hey all,
 
I can't seem to get my mind around how to solve the following problem I
am
having.  I have rules to match a try-catch construct similar to that
in
Java:
 
statement! :
   stateTry:TRY tryBlock:block idCATCH:catchBlock ( idFINALLY:FINALLY
finallyBlock:block )?
   { #statement = #(#stateTry, #tryBlock, #(#[CATCH], #idCATCH),
#(#idFINALLY, #finallyBlock)); } 
   ;
 
catchBlock! :
   ( idCATCH:CATCH LPAREN! eType:identifier eID:IDENTIFIER RPAREN!
catchBody:block
       { #catchBlock = #(#catchBlock, #idCATCH, #eType, #eID,
#catchBody); }
   )+
   ;
These rules match input similar to the following:
 
try {
}
catch(Exception1 e1) {
}
catch(Exception2 e2) {
}
catch(Exception3 e3) {
}
finally {
}
 
I would like the resulting AST tree for the catchBlock rule to look
like the
following:
 
idCatch--(right)--&gt;Exception1--(right)--&gt;e1--(right)--&gt;block--(right)--&gt;null
   |
(down)
   |
   v
idCatch--(right)--&gt;Exception2--(right)--&gt;e2--(right)--&gt;block--(right)--&gt;null
   |
(down)
   |
   v
idCatch--(right)--&gt;Exception3--(right)--&gt;e3--(right)--&gt;block--(right)--&gt;null
   |
(down)
   |
   v
 null
 
Everything parses without errors, but the resulting AST from the
catchBlock
rule contains only the first and last catch AST's, the rest are
somehow
discarded.  What I suspect is happening is that instead of adding an
additional child, it overwrites it.  What is the syntax to construct an
AST
by appending consecutive subtrees to the resulting root AST for the
catchBlock rule?  I am unable to find (or missed) any reference on how
to do
this.
 
Thanks,
 
Jeff

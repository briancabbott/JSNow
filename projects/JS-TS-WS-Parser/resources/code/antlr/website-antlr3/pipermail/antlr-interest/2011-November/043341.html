<PRE>Hi Morgan,

Well, I'm a newbie too, but I can tell you how I understand and use StringTemplates. For me, the end result of walking a tree that produces StringTemplates is a StringTemplate which contains elements which are themselves StringTemplates (or lists of String Templates), which contains elements which are themselves StringTemplates (or lists of String Templates), and so on. At this point no &quot;rendering&quot; to actual strings has been done. After the giant StringTemplate amalgam is created, rendering the top level StringTemplate will render all the sub-StringTemplate in turn, all the way down the tree.

In a way you have created a different sort of StringTemplate tree during the tree walk, but it is not the AST itself.

So as you are walking a tree, you are taking the StringTemplates returned by rules and putting them into StringTemplates of the containing rules, and the top level rule returns the top level StringTemplate.

I hope this is clear, and the experts can correct my misunderstandings,

- Andy

Subject: [antlr-interest] confused about rendering all String Templates...

I've gotten a lexer, parser (that outputs AST) and a tree parser work.

Currently the tree parser contain little code snippets that include System.out.println to print my translated file.

Not very pretty, but it works.

My next step was to switch to StringTemplates, because I thought it would help me clean up the tree parser.
So far my initial efforts haven't yielded much.

After reading TP's books and (this morning) about 40 pages of interest messages about templates I'm beginning to think I might be misunderstanding the use of String Templates...

I thought I could include a template and after walking my tree I could call getTemplate on my return object and then toString to have it dump out the results of ALL my templates, but as far as I can tell it only prints out the template of the rule  I called.

I've debugged the resulting .java file and I can step into the results from each rule and see that a correct template is created.
But I can't figure out how to &quot;walk&quot; all the templates and have them dump out my results.

&gt;<i>From the reading I've done this morning I'm beginning to believe that
</I>the templates aren't expected to do this...

Can someone clear this up for me?
Point me in the direction of a template example that demonstrates this if it is suppose to work.

Any help is appreciated.

Morgan

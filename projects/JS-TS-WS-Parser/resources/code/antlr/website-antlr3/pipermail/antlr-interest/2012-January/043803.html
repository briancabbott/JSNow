<PRE>Hold on a sec... I get that if the only way to rewrite a tree is to make a
new tree, then comparing the pointers of the root nodes is the equality
test.  But I was assuming that the &quot;new&quot; tree might actually reuse most of
the old tree and in particular the root node.  I'm pretty sure I missed an
imprtanr assumption in your question.

Re the role of antlr building trees v. Listeners later...Ah...I get it
now.

I've read your email twice.  I will read it again.  Sounds complicated.
Would Sam's idea (stack machine) help simplify this?

I like animals.  So does Honey Badger, just not the same way.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't have answers, but I have questions which might at least cut off
</I>&gt;<i> some dead ends...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree that point #2 seems pretty clear.  And I realize that this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     newtree = listener.someEvent(oldtree);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     if ( newtree!=oldtree ) replace-oldtree-with-newtree;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is pseudo-code.  You probably have this all worked out, but it occurs to
</I>&gt;<i> me that comparing two trees may be more expensive than necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would be comparing pointers. if the pointers are different, I would slip
</I>&gt;<i> in the new pointer. only the replace operation is pseudocode. In reality it
</I>&gt;<i> would simply be &quot;set the ith child pointer to the new pointer&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Despite the fact that walking a tree of n nodes is O(n), and so
</I>&gt;<i> comparing two trees (non-naively) is also O(n), there may be a lot of data
</I>&gt;<i> in those nodes to compare.  If all we care about is detecting changes, a
</I>&gt;<i> significant speedup is possible if the interface for a tree object (or for
</I>&gt;<i> listeners acting on trees?) includes a flag that gets flipped by any
</I>&gt;<i> operation which has the possibility of changing the tree.  (N.B.
</I>&gt;<i> Possibility, not guarantee.  A guarantee would require the eval we're
</I>&gt;<i> trying to avoid.)  This tiny bit of added API built into a Listener
</I>&gt;<i> baseclass for processing tree changes (which are all covered by a small,
</I>&gt;<i> finite set of generic operations) would turn the subsequent O(n) comparison
</I>&gt;<i> into O(1).  I'm not sure how this fits with your design.  Of course, all
</I>&gt;<i> bets are off if someone messes with the tree directly.  (N.B.
</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively, a hash on trees would be almost as cheap and require no
</I>&gt;<i> extra API, but that only works if we're willing to treat topologically
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent trees with different memory layouts (e.g. flipping a tree
</I>&gt;<i> left-to right) as different.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think we need to do anything fancy. All we are doing is altering
</I>&gt;<i> pointers in the tree. If you want to delete a subtree, return null. If you
</I>&gt;<i> want to leaves the tree as it is, return the original pointer. If you want
</I>&gt;<i> to alter a subtree, return a pointer to the new tree.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ok, now point #1.  Not sure how to approach this, but...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thought: If the root of a rule r which returns a value does not declare
</I>&gt;<i> the type of value expected, two questions arise. One, where/when does the
</I>&gt;<i> antlr tool perform type-checking for the rules which consume rule r?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR would not be involved in this case because all ANTLR does is create
</I>&gt;<i> the parse trees. Our listener would be annotating those trees.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Two, where/when does the antlr tool perform type-checking of the retvals
</I>&gt;<i> from listeners for different alts of r?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Again, I don't think ANTLR is involved here. the only way it would get
</I>&gt;<i> involved as if we defined return values or parameters that get shoved into
</I>&gt;<i> the context objects. And the context objects are the parse tree nodes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps an explicit decoration/declaration of a type T at the root of r
</I>&gt;<i> is the easiest, clearest and safest way to communicate to all of the
</I>&gt;<i> listeners of all of the alts of r that they must return type T.  My
</I>&gt;<i> thinking here is probably clouded by my preternaturally strong preference
</I>&gt;<i> for static typing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I too am leaning toward some static typing, but I hesitate to put &quot;returns
</I>&gt;<i> [T v]&quot; into the grammar because T it is application-specific. and, more
</I>&gt;<i> importantly, it is pass specific. each pass might need a different type so
</I>&gt;<i> we would need to do something like &quot;returns [T v, U w]&quot; but then the
</I>&gt;<i> grammar is specifically tied to a particular application and literally the
</I>&gt;<i> parser would not compile without having those types available. there would
</I>&gt;<i> be no way to provide such a generic grammar to users on the ANTLR website.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We need a way to decorate or annotate a node in a type safe way.  To do
</I>&gt;<i> that in Java, we have to use of classes or interfaces or something.
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly, we can provide a factory that creates the various contexts to
</I>&gt;<i> use our subclasses of ParserRuleContext like T and U. The only problem is
</I>&gt;<i> that the tree node types can only be sent once: on construction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What if we had some kind of adapter that fed the listeners proxies? So the
</I>&gt;<i> original parse tree has generic nodes like ruleContext and we need T and U
</I>&gt;<i> for 2 different phases. As the parse tree walker moved along, it could wrap
</I>&gt;<i> the generic ruleContext objects with a proxy, of type T, that had the extra
</I>&gt;<i> information we need. T with points at ruleContext instead of using
</I>&gt;<i> inheritance.  If we didn't reuse the proxies, however, we would have to
</I>&gt;<i> create a new object for every listener event. That's not the end of the
</I>&gt;<i> world as I do that during parsing. But, we could think about reusing proxy
</I>&gt;<i> objects, though I doubt we would know when the application was going to
</I>&gt;<i> refer to multiple contexts. As long as the proxy object popped into
</I>&gt;<i> existence for the listener event and popped out of existence afterwards,
</I>&gt;<i> should not burden the garbage collector (which does not walk dead objects).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> let's see what this would look like. Here is a chunk of the parse tree
</I>&gt;<i> walker:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ParseTree.RuleNode r = (ParseTree.RuleNode)t;
</I>&gt;<i> enterRule(listener, r);
</I>&gt;<i> int n = r.getChildCount();
</I>&gt;<i> for (int i = 0; i&lt;n; i++) {
</I>&gt;<i>    walk(listener, r.getChild(i));
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> exitRule(listener, r);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And let's say we have an adapter that knows how to create wrappers for
</I>&gt;<i> parse tree nodes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> adaptor.wrap(t); // returns type T or U or whatever you want
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> may be like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> class T {
</I>&gt;<i>    ParserRuleContext delegate; // hide in a superclass somewhere
</I>&gt;<i>    int v; // my field
</I>&gt;<i>    public T(ParserRuleContext ctx) { delegate = ctx; }
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> class myAdaptor&lt;T&gt; implements ParseTreeWrapper {
</I>&gt;<i>    public T wrap(ParserRuleContext t) { return new T(t); }
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then, all we have to do is change the enter event to look like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> enterRule(listener, adaptor.wrap(r));
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The listener event would have to cast the ParserRuleContext to T or U etc&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> public void exitRule(AParser.multContext ctx) {
</I>&gt;<i>    T t = (T)ctx;
</I>&gt;<i>    t.v = t.a.v * t.b.v;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MUCH cleaner and type safe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OTOH, we could reverse it by adding a pointer to every parse tree node
</I>&gt;<i> that points to an object with extra fields. Only those parse trees that
</I>&gt;<i> need extra fields would have a pointer to an auxiliary object or object
</I>&gt;<i> extension if you will.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or, As Sam said, we could provide a factory for creating the various parse
</I>&gt;<i> tree nodes. If our application needed object extensions, we could pass in a
</I>&gt;<i> factory that created special context objects that had our fields. Those
</I>&gt;<i> objects would have to have a union of all the values needed by all phases,
</I>&gt;<i> but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's often the case that I want my
</I>&gt;<i> type computation information to persist through multiple phases all the way
</I>&gt;<i> through to code generation. On the other hand, if we have lots of temporary
</I>&gt;<i> values we need just for computation, the tree node would have lots of extra
</I>&gt;<i> fields, mucking up our class. I suppose nothing beats the simplicity of a
</I>&gt;<i> factory creating the right objects. Then we can create a class like this
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> class T extends ParserRuleContext {
</I>&gt;<i>    int v; // temp value
</I>&gt;<i>    TypeInfo type; // persists across tree passes
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that we would need a new class definition for every
</I>&gt;<i> context, meaning every rule, in the grammar. yuck.  actually, maybe it is
</I>&gt;<i> not too bad because we would only need to annotate some of the nodes such
</I>&gt;<i> as eContext.  We would still need a typecast in the listeners like:  T t =
</I>&gt;<i> (T)ctx;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It'd be simpler to add a field to ParserRuleContext and had a generic type
</I>&gt;<i> because it means creating only a single object:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> class ParserRuleContext&lt;T&gt; {
</I>&gt;<i>    T extension;
</I>&gt;<i>    &#8230; existing stuff ...
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of the various context object types could point at the single type of
</I>&gt;<i> extension object.  I guess it would mean adding code in the listeners like
</I>&gt;<i> this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> public void exitRule(AParser.multContext&lt;T&gt; ctx) {
</I>&gt;<i>    if ( ctx.extension==null ) ctx.extension = new T();
</I>&gt;<i>    T t = ctx.extension;
</I>&gt;<i>    T a = ctx.a.extension; // ugh; kind of a mouthful
</I>&gt;<i>    T b = ctx.b.extension;
</I>&gt;<i>    t.v = a.v * b.v;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> one thing I should note about the stack solution. I wonder if it might get
</I>&gt;<i> confusing knowing what is on the stack and what is not, particularly if not
</I>&gt;<i> every event has a listener implementation (that pushed a value). If the
</I>&gt;<i> values are stored in the parse tree contexts, you know that that no does
</I>&gt;<i> not have a value. With a stack, you would see a value computed way below
</I>&gt;<i> that you don't necessarily want. You would not know that it is not the
</I>&gt;<i> value you want because it is a disembodied value on the stack. That said,
</I>&gt;<i> it's simplicity is appealing. If we need to annotate the tree anyway,
</I>&gt;<i> however, maybe we do need a solution like I describe above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, I'm not sure if any of this helps.  But I'm reasonably confident
</I>&gt;<i> that it does not hurt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;no animals were hurt during the production of this e-mail&quot; :)

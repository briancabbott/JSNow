As Stroustrup says in Appx B of his book, &quot;with minor exceptions, C++ is 
a superset of [C89] C... Well-written C programs tend to be C++ programs 
as well&quot;. Sure, you can write bad C that won't compile as C++, but you 
can't fix bad C programs automatically, which appears to be what the OP 
wanted.

Anyway, it's not at all obvious what the OP wanted to do. g++ is just a 
driver for GCC: it assumes that the default language is C++, and that 
you need to link against the C++ libraries. It has no problem compiling 
C programs, even bad ones, and certainly ones which aren't valid C++.

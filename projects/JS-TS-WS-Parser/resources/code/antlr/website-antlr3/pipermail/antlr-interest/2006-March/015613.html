every case, and I do expect NCNAMEs in all those places. 

I guess you also meant s/operators/keywords/? Then yes, this knowledge is 
available, since the grammar contains e.g. (simplified)

data_term : &quot;declare&quot; (&quot;ns-prefix&quot; NCNAME ASSIGN STRING)* LP (data_term)* RP
          | (...) =&gt; NCNAME (AT NCNAME)? (COLON NCNAME) LP (data_term)* RP
          | NCNAME
          ;

[LP = '(', RP = ')', guessing left empty for simplicity, see below]

and all NCNAMEs must not test for keywords (literals), although &quot;declare&quot; etc. 
must do so. The generated code could be modified to switch testLiterals on 
and off in each and every place where NCNAME is used.

&gt;<i> If it's really exactly one place, then this probably means your just
</I>&gt;<i> referring there from exactly one place, i.e. the &quot;identifier&quot; rule is
</I>&gt;<i> only accessed from one point. You can then switch off literal testing in
</I>&gt;<i> the calling rule before the branching decision is made, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> fooRule:
</I>&gt;<i>   BAR BAZ { lexer.testLiterals = off; } identifier;
</I>The big problem with this is that guessing won't pick it up and will thus 
fail. In the above grammar I need the guessing in the second line (left 
empty) to see if there is at least an LP coming up.

But thanks for your help anyway!

Actually, I just had an idea: what about switching testLiterals off completely 
in the lexer and (in the generated parser code) in every place where there's 
an 
  LA(1)==SOME_KEYWORD 
replace the code with 
  LA(1)==NCNAME &amp;&amp; testLiteralsTable(LA(1))==SOME_KEYWORD
?
That would work, no? And it could be done with a little script?

Cheers,

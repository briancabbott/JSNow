<PRE>
	I need to preserve all original tokens.  I've been looking at
	Terrence's TokenWithIndex approach.  Consider this:

		declareThing
		    : DECLARE!
		        ( baseURIDecl
		        | functionDecl
		        | // ...
		        )
		    ;

		baseURIDecl
		    : b:BASE_URI^ uri=stringLiteral
		        {
			    #b.setType( BASE_URI_DECL );
		        }
		    ;

	i.e., this language has a bunch of &quot;declare&quot; statements each of
	which begin with the keyword &quot;declare&quot;.  Not surprisingly,
	&quot;declare&quot; has been left-factored.

	I want each token in the generated AST to have min/max indicies
	into a list of all tokens, but I want *all* the min/max to
	include factored tokens as well: in this case, I want the min
	index for BASE_URL_DECL to be that of the DECLARE.

	A practicle application of this (i.e., why I want this) is to do
	something that many IDE editors do: if there is an error in a
	statement, I want to underline the entire statement with a red
	squiggly line.  For the case at hand, that includes &quot;declare&quot;.

	As written, Terrence's solution will not include any left-
	factored token indicies.  So the question is: what's a good way
	to get what I want?

	One way is to somehow pass the left-factored token &quot;down&quot; to the
	other rules that can then obtain its index and set their min
	accordingly.

	A similar problem also occurs with discarded tokens, e.g.,
	'(' and ')' in parenthesizedExpr.  If you were to have:

		(3 + 4)
		0123456

	I would want the min/max for '+' to be 0/6 and not 1/5.  For
	this case, one could set the min/max explicitly easily since
	it's all in the same fule, i.e.:

		parenthesizedExpr
		    : l:LPAREN! e:expr r:RPAREN!
		    	{
			    #e.setMinMax( l.getMin(), r.getMax() );
			}
		    ;

	(Or something like that.)  But is there something better/easier?

	- Paul

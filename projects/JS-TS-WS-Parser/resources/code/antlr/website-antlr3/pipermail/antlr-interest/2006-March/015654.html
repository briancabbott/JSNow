<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I have implemented a language translation system both with and without 
treeparsers. My problem with treeparsers is the mixing of grammar and logic, 
which might my considered a plus by others. 

For my implementation without treeparsers I was greatly influenced by the 
implementation of the Boo language, which uses ANTLR for parsing. Everyone 
who is looking for an alternative for treewalkers should have  a look at the 
Boo code. Just like Boo I use a small script (&lt;100 lines of python code) to 
generate the heterogeneous classes and visitors/transformers. This approach 
has worked well for me and might work for others too.

Cheers,

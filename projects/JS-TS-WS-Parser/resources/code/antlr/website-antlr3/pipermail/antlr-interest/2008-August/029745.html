The token labels are now all done using = instead of : (IIRC you 
could use either in v2, but : was more common for some reason).

As for the values themselves:
   - t.getFile() : no equivalent AFAIK.  You'll have to track this 
yourself.
   - t.getLine() =&gt; $t.line
   - t.getColumn() =&gt; $t.pos
(see: 
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Attribute+and+Dynamic+Scopes">http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Attribute+and+Dynamic+Scopes</A>)

You might find it useful to look through the examples in the wiki:
   <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Examples">http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Examples</A>
(As well as the downloadable ones, of course.)

&gt;<i>   My 2.X code also had grammar like
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   tokens {
</I>&gt;<i>      ADJACENCY = &quot;adjacency&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i>     PATTERN = &quot;pattern&quot;;
</I>&gt;<i>   }
</I>[...]
&gt;<i>    I actually found what seemed to be 3.X examples using the 
</I>&gt;<i> above tokens syntax.  However, it doesn't seem to work.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> proper form seems to be:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   tokens {
</I>&gt;<i>       ADJACENCY : 'adjacency';
</I>&gt;<i>      PATTERN : 'pattern';
</I>&gt;<i>   }
</I>
Actually you were right the first time (except you do need single 
quotes).  However, ANTLR is a bit sensitive as to where you put it 
-- it has to appear after the options block (if present) but 
before any rules and before any @something blocks.  Also, for some 
weird reason you get errors if you use it in a lexer-only grammar; 
to work around that you'll need to define regular rules instead 
(which is exactly like your second example except removing the 
surrounding 'tokens { }' bit).

&gt;<i>   These are reserved words in the query language.  I really 
</I>&gt;<i> don't like the habit in the example code of using quoted strings 
</I>&gt;<i> like 'adjacency' in the grammar rules.
</I>
Good.  You hang on to that dislike -- it will serve you well.

&gt;<i>   As noted in the 2.X to 3.X documentation, there's no built in 
</I>&gt;<i> way to create case insensitivity without overriding the scanner 
</I>&gt;<i> input stream.
</I>
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1782">http://www.antlr.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1782</A>

&gt;<i>   The good news is that there's documentation, but for some 
</I>&gt;<i> reason with ANTLR there never seems to be enough documentation 
</I>&gt;<i> to make the initial learning curve anything but painful.
</I>
Yep.  But there's all these helpful people around :)  (And hey, I 
manage to get by without even reading the ANTLR book, so it can't 
be all that bad.)

&gt;<i>   I noticed that the person who maintains the 2.X C++ grammar is 
</I>&gt;<i> looking for someone to take it over since they don't want to 
</I>&gt;<i> deal with the conversion to ANTLR 3.X.  I can't say I blame 
</I>&gt;<i> them.   My grammar is a lot smaller and it's going to be at 
</I>&gt;<i> least a two day slog with a fair amount of frustration.
</I>
Jim Idle has mentioned that he plans to build a C++ target at some 
point soon.  Although it's hard to say whether it's going to be a 
separate library or whether it will simply wrap the existing C 
runtime.  (He's announced both as possibilities at various points, 
IIRC.)

&gt;<i>   In addition to the fact that the 2.X grammar is obsolete, I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> doing the conversion because I am hoping that the LL(*) will 
</I>&gt;<i> avoid left factoring my grammar into a less clear form.  I hope 
</I>&gt;<i> that I am not disappointed.
</I>
You might be.  Left factoring is critically important -- perhaps 
even more so in v3 than it was in v2.  The v3 lexer is much weaker 
(in my opinion) and needs more hand-holding than the v2 one did, 
despite its newfound Unicode support.

Having said that, for the most part the v3 grammars that I've seen 
just seem a bit &quot;tidier&quot; than their v2 counterparts.  But that's 
just a subjective thing :)

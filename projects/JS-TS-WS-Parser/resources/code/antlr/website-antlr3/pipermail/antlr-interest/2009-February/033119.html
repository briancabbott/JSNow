<PRE>Hello again!

I have to be more precise here. Backtracking is not what I want, as it 
recognizes the string &quot;AAB&quot; as &quot;any,any,some&quot;, whereas I want it to be 
recognized as &quot;any,some&quot;. I understand that I could write a semantic 
predicate like :

   rule     : ( {input.LA(1) != B &amp;&amp; (input.LA(1) != A || input.LA(2) != 
B)}? any )+ some;

which works very nice. However, I have (literally) hundreds of places in 
my grammar that would need this workaround (each with a different 
&quot;lookahead language&quot;), so I would like to ask if there is a more formal 
way to do it. If not, how hard would it be to extend ANTLR with such a 
mechanism? If you could provide me with some pointers/hints, I would be 
happy to implement this myself.

Best Regards,
Andreas Meyer

</I>&gt;<i>    | B
</I>&gt;<i>    ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I want to combine those two rules:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> rule     : ( options{ greedy=false;} : any )+ some      ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> .. such that the inner loop should consume any's, as long as LA(1)!=B 
</I>&gt;<i> &amp;&amp; (LA(1)!=A||LA(2)!=B). This should be easily recognizable by the 
</I>&gt;<i> parser (in my opinion). However, ANTLR 3 (3.1.2) says:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> warning: Decision can match input such as &quot;A B&quot; using multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> alternatives: 1, 2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that when I change the rule &quot;some&quot; to:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> some : A | B;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> such that only a lookahead of one character is enough, everything 
</I>&gt;<i> works as expected: &quot;any&quot; is consumed until a character is found from 
</I>&gt;<i> the difference &quot;any-some&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I thought &quot;ok, use backtracking&quot;. Enabling it globally seems to 
</I>&gt;<i> work. But, if I try to enable it only locally, it does not seem to 
</I>&gt;<i> have any effect. Actually, I tried to enable it for any rule in my 
</I>&gt;<i> grammar - without any effect! (I include the grammar in question as 
</I>&gt;<i> attachement)
</I>&gt;<i>

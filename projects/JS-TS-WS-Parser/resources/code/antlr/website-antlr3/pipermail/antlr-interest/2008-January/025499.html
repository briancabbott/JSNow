What sort of 
code?  Constants?  Superclasses?  Support 
classes/methods?  Any of those could be dealt 
with as a separate file easily enough.

</I>
Lexer operation is basically just calling 
nextToken to retrieve one token at a 
time.  Calling emit sets the data for that token; 
not calling it will lead to generating a default 
token based on all the characters matched by the rule.

I'm not really familiar with the Java runtime, so 
I'm not sure what the reset call affects.  It 
might destroy an emit as well (and you probably 
can't emit afterwards successfully 
either).  Still, it could be worth a try.

The rule must currently be returning *something*, 
though, since every top-level lexer rule called 
must return a token.  Trace it through with a 
debugger and see what's going on.

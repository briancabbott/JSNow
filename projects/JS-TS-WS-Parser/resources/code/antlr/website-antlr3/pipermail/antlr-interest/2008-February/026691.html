Well, then start with Pascal.

If you haven't figured it out by now, no one has written an ANTLR 
grammar for some nebulous, unspecified, vaguely similar to Pascal 
language. And, dare I ask, &quot;why would they?&quot;

You're really on your own. You have to be 100% precise and specific 
about both the input and the output languages you wish to work with. 
There's simply no way around that, and saying things like &quot;close to 
Pascal&quot; simply won't cut it.


&gt;<i> I doubt that this average end user
</I>
Well, your &quot;average&quot; and mine are probably very different.


&gt;<i> is familiar to Lisp...(and to follow you, i shall say that there are a

Oy. There _is no &quot;common&quot; pseudocode_!! None. Never. Anywhere!!!!


&gt;<i> just as in the past (some 20 years ago) people developed CASE tools
</I>&gt;<i> for the lazy programmers..
</I>
Excuse me? What CASE tools? For which &quot;lazy&quot; programmers? And, if I dare 
say it, what might be the proper characterization of someone who wants 
to use someone else's grammar? &quot;Lazy,&quot; perhaps?


&gt;<i> Thanks all&#160; !&#160;&#160; :-\
</I>
Yeah, sure.

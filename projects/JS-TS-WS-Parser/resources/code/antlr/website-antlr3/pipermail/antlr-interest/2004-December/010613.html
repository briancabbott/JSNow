Have you ever looked at the &quot;Selective Undo&quot; stuff?  I like their 
argument for creating algebraic operations on your documents and then 
being able to reason about whether something can be undone or not.  
Also, they can compute whether you can undo not just the last action, 
but any action and tell if it would conflict with a subsequent action, 
etc.  Commutivity is your friend!	

My paper gives a good overview of this algorithm and has references.

Implementing a Selective Undo Framework in Python

I have not really kept up with literature on this.  One email 
discussion I was in said that the idea had been discounted but they 
never provided a reference and I never found an argument against at the 
time.

Please let me know if you have any good links on the subject, it's a 
pet project of mine as well.

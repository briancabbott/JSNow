<PRE>Thanks. I was worried that might be it :-(

So I've got to update my system to 9.1 (that implies 7.2 is about 2-3
years old - I can't remember).

Oh well, I was hoping to avoid that.

Cheers,
Wol

Smells like a very old gcc. The problem is that it probably only has
istream.h and not the standard compliant istream include usually one can
work around this by symlinking the file x.h to x.

Another workaround is to grab a newer gcc and use that one for the
complete
project (mixing C++ code of different gcc's is usually a bad idea due to
a
load of ABI changes). If this suse still has 2.95.2/3 as compiler than
you'll love gcc 3 since it has a lot better error messages.

The latest 3.3 release gcc is a good one. 3.4 also does well but has
more
trouble with 'old' code. (also error messages are a bit wackier, mostly
I
guess due to the new frontend for C++ compiling is my guess)

Cheers,

Ric

If you're not afraid to maintain a own backend library you could dumb
the AST's down. E.g. typedef the RefAST to a real pointer then get rid
of the virtuals (if you don't use polymorphism anywhere) Use some
allocator to allocate AST's between passes. Then throw complete trees
away as you go and don't need them anymore. Cut out all the separate
strings from the AST and hash them once, then only store int's in the
AST (or only pointers to the strings). (Or don't even carry the
strings around if you don't need them). There's so many places were
stuff is copied that it's sick.

There's really a lot of places where you can optimize. The codegen
might need some small massaging, or use a sed/tcl/perl script to fix
the generated code (should be easy to include in a build system)

I guess you could 'prototype' such a hacked library pretty quick (few
days) Then see if the gain is worth it. If you only concentrate on the
tree stuff it should be manageable I think. Maybe you could hack
something together that talks native antlr tree on one side and custom
tree on the other.

Cheers,

Ric

<PRE>It's possible we could do it that way, but I've avoided it. We're
using the Java target for our DSL, so a direct C wrapper would
probably require that we tap everything through Java, then through
JNI. So if we supported a straight C wrapper, it might be a little
complicated making it work with our DSL in terms of the way we make
users create their custom libraries. I suppose we could allow a
wrapper into and out of Java directly, which would probably get us
most of the way there, as users can then do whatever they want in JNI
anyway, but this still seems pretty messy. Perhaps a CORBA-like
middle-ware architecture? I guess most languages don't really do that
for this sort of thing ...

Hmm,

Stefik

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Hey folks,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Our development team here is nearly complete with a DSL that we've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; designed and are hoping to ship the first open-source version in July
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; or so. Right now, we parse down to the ANTLR Java target and are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; preparing for the version past this release, which I think needs to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; include some extension libraries for the language. For example, while
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; our DSL can do all of the typical language things (e.g., if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; statements, looping), there are no APIs or libraries for doing file
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; IO, connecting to hardware, network programming, or other such things.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Does this community have any experience adding in these sorts of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; features, as in, suggestions as for what kind of approach we should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; take? For example, we could allow something like a Java Native
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Interface, that would allow a developer to connect in utilities that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; allow things like File access. Or, we could allow custom native
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; functions for low level things, like a file keyword, but that doesn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; sound very flexible or extensible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Any general suggestions on an appropriate approach to take?

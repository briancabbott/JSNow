<PRE>Patrick,

Thanks for the suggestion. I'll give it a try. Could you please elaborate on
how to ensure that there are no line terminators in those rules which
disallow them? It's a bit disappointing that these kinds of manipulation tie
the grammar to a specific language, i.e. Java, but I think that's
unavoidable if I want to eliminate the excessive LT!* elements from all of
the rules. It's a simple trade-off, I guess.

What problem are you having with unicode identifiers?  I don't think there
was any problem with Greg's original grammar (apart from the ANTLRWorks
debugger issue I mentioned). As for regular expression literals, I'm
inclined to simply treat them as separate Regex tokens without any further
treatment, and leave their analysis to a separate grammar. Interestingly
enough, whilst the ECMAScript spec has a whole section on the composition of
regular expression literals, it doesn't appear to incorporate them into the
rest of the grammar - not that I could see, anyway. I think they can be
included as an alternative in the literal rule, which then becomes

literal : 'null' | 'true' | 'false' | StringLiteral | NumericLiteral | Regex


Regards,

Chris

</I>&gt;<i> I've written an complete ECMAScript compiant grammar recently.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've struggled with the following issues:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -          Unicode identifiers
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -          Regular expression literals
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -          Semicolon insertion
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the semicolon insertion issue I've taken the following approach.  The
</I>&gt;<i> line terminators are left on the hidden channel. In the parser the semicolon
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. in statements) is defined as a rule. In this rule I scan the token
</I>&gt;<i> stream for line terminators and promote the first encountered to the default
</I>&gt;<i> channel. Line terminator are also an alternative in this rule. Something
</I>&gt;<i> like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> semic:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> @init
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 : SEMIC
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 | EOL
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 | RBRACE { input.rewind(marker); }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 | EOF
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The grammar also scans for line terminators in places where the
</I>&gt;<i> specification states there are none allowed (e.g. between &quot;return&quot; and the
</I>&gt;<i> following optional expression in the return statement).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this helps.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The approach I took was to keep LT tokens on the default channel, for the
</I>&gt;<i> benefit of the few rules where line terminators are important. For example,
</I>&gt;<i> the ECMAScript spec defines a return statement as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 'return' [no LineTerminator here] Expression[optional] ';'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the ANTLR grammar, this becomes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> returnStatement : 'return' expression (LT | ';')! ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can see that the statement may end either with a semicolon or with a
</I>&gt;<i> line terminator, which the ECMAScript spec permits. This appears to work
</I>&gt;<i> just fine. The only part I find annoying is that because the LT tokens are
</I>&gt;<i> not on the hidden channel, all of the other rules need to deal with them
</I>&gt;<i> too. For example, the ifStatement rule looks like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ifStatement : 'if' LT!* '(' LT!* expression LT!* ')' LT!* statement (LT!*
</I>&gt;<i> 'else' LT!* statement)? ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> when it would be much clearer if it looked like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ifStatement : 'if' '(' expression ')' statement ('else' statement)? ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This affects all of the parser rules, which makes the grammar less
</I>&gt;<i> readable. I did think about performing some filtering of the token stream
</I>&gt;<i> between the lexing and parsing phases, but the rules for automatic semicolon
</I>&gt;<i> insertion defined by the ECMAScript are a bit nasty. It's just too difficult
</I>&gt;<i> to actually determine where the virtual semicolons should be, without the
</I>&gt;<i> grammatical context that only the parsing stage can provide. In any case, I
</I>&gt;<i> think the grammar would be less useful if it required any special runtime
</I>&gt;<i> tweaks to make it work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think what would really solve the problem would be to have the LT tokens
</I>&gt;<i> on the hidden channel by default, and then dynamically switch them to the
</I>&gt;<i> default channel only for those rules that require it. I'm afraid I'm not yet
</I>&gt;<i> familiar enough with channels and token streams to know if this is even
</I>&gt;<i> possible. My guess is that it probably isn't, but it can't hurt to ask.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Chris
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. I've just remembered that although the grammar compiles just fine, I
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't get it to work with the ANTLRWorks debugger. It seems like it's the
</I>&gt;<i> huge Identifier lexer rule that causes the problem - I had to temporarily
</I>&gt;<i> replace it with something simpler in order to persuade the debugger to work.
</I>&gt;<i> I presume this is a bug in ANTLRWorks - if anyone is interested in this, I
</I>&gt;<i> can provide more information, perhaps off-line.

</I>&gt;<i> like that. I did something like that (but with the text) to deal with
</I>&gt;<i> indentation sensitivity in my only attempt with ANTLR. As I said, not

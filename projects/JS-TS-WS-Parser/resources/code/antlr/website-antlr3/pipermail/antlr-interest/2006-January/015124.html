Yes, I remember having to use Prolog. Which was the coolest thing, but
you really had to consciously keep the number of rules low.

&gt;<i> 2. patterns have no guarantee of coverage whereas a tree grammar does.

What does this mean?

&gt;<i> 3. patterns are floating in space w/o context; a grammar knows that

</I>
This is probably the biggest reason. I guess rule-based translation
makes sense for simple translations but I can't see it working for full
translations.

&gt;<i> The translation of a pattern -&gt; replacement system would be trivial  
</I>&gt;<i> for a simple system; just translate to ANTLR.  Further, to separate  
</I>&gt;<i> the view from the controller, one could use templates on the right:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&lt;a:expr&gt;+&lt;b:expr&gt;&quot; -&gt; add(left=a,right=b)
</I>
or the equivalent in ST:

add(lexpr,rexpr)::&lt;&lt;
(&lt;lexpr&gt;) + (&lt;rexpr&gt;)
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
Still haven't figured out how to get rid of 
((((((((5))))))) + ((((((3)))))))) but it would probably require a
change in the grammar rules, is all.

I think this whole thread will converge to say: &quot;Hey wait, what we got
is the best way&quot;.

&gt;<i> or some such just like an antlr grammar.  The idea would be really  
</I>&gt;<i> groovy.  You give me a grammar and then a list of patterns and I  
</I>&gt;<i> generate a combined new grammar that does exactly what you want,  
</I>&gt;<i> yanking in all the required tokens/rules.  Now where is a grad  
</I>&gt;<i> student when I need some cheap smart labor! ;)  Actually, that would  
</I>&gt;<i> make a damn fine paper and system.
</I>
Academia... shudder... (its ok, they feel the same way about me :D)

<PRE>Hi Chris,

I've just had a quick look and your nondeterminism may be avoided by 
changing the params rule:

params
:<i>
</I>	( SEMI ( WS )* param )+
	;


Note the change from * to +
Your original params rule could have matched nothing, which is 
usually to be avoided.

HTH,
Lubos.

</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, first thing is the two problems i'm having specifically:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, there are indeterminacies in the grammar on lines 39-51 (5 of

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Second, there's a part of the vcard spec that essentially allows the

</I>&gt;<i> that?  When i reach the point in the line where there can be a 
</I>value,
&gt;<i> it could be plain text, quoted-printable, base64 encoded, or some
</I>&gt;<i> other as-yet unknown arbitrary encoding.  The only thing i do know 
</I>at
&gt;<i> this point is that i can pretty much be assured that everything
</I>&gt;<i> following a colon in the line will be a value of some kind, and
</I>&gt;<i> there's nothing else that comes after it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With respect to other critiques, as far as i'm concerned, if you're
</I>&gt;<i> kind enough to take the time to examine this novice's work, i will 
</I>be
&gt;<i> more than happy to learn from you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance.

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've found the following bugs in the generated parser (C target):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. This is the most annoying problem because I cannot solve it any
</I>&gt;<i> other way. My tree grammar is:
</I>&gt;<i> function:	^(Function ^(DatabaseObject Nil COUNT) countArgument) -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> ^(Function[$COUNT.text] countArgument);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The excerpt from generated code for this is:
</I>&gt;<i> pANTLR3_BASE_TREE root_1 = (pANTLR3_BASE_TREE)(ADAPTOR-&gt;nilNode(ADAPTOR));
</I>&gt;<i> root_1 = (pANTLR3_BASE_TREE)(ADAPTOR-&gt;becomeRoot(ADAPTOR,
</I>&gt;<i>     (pANTLR3_BASE_TREE)ADAPTOR-&gt;createTypeText(ADAPTOR, Function,
</I>&gt;<i> (pANTLR3_UINT8)(COUNT162-&gt;getText(COUNT162))), root_1));
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The COUNT162-&gt;getText(COUNT162) function returns pANTLR3_STRING which
</I>&gt;<i> is casted to pANTLR3_UINT8??? When I manually change the code to:
</I>&gt;<i> root_1 = (pANTLR3_BASE_TREE)(ADAPTOR-&gt;becomeRoot(ADAPTOR,
</I>&gt;<i>     (pANTLR3_BASE_TREE)ADAPTOR-&gt;createTypeText(ADAPTOR, Function,
</I>&gt;<i> (pANTLR3_UINT8)(COUNT162-&gt;getText(COUNT162)-&gt;chars)), root_1));
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I think that all of that is fixed in the 3.1.4 beta if you want to try 
that, but there is a fundamental problem in that the Java target is 
using overloaded functions to do this and I have no way at template 
generation time to know what the intent was. Realistically, we need to 
make the code generator call a different template or set a flag to say 
which behavior it is expecting.
&gt;<i> it works as expected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. My tree grammar doesn't do a lot. Because of that I wanted to
</I>&gt;<i> switch on rewriting (options {rewrite = true;}). But the generated
</I>&gt;<i> parser was not able to be compiled. Some variables were not defined,
</I>&gt;<i> getParent() function was called on ADAPTOR which doesn't contain
</I>&gt;<i> anything similar etc. (when I generated Java parser from that grammar
</I>&gt;<i> it was compiled correctly)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>You probably need to send me an example please. Also, please verify that 
this is the same with 3.1.4-beta as that sounds familiar.
&gt;<i> 3. The wildcard is not working for the C target! I reported that here
</I>&gt;<i> already that there was no response. 
</I>Sorry, but I have been busy earning a living lately. I am aware of this, 
and am just not quite in sync with Java on that one. But, you can easily 
do the same thing with an action code.
&gt;<i> So once more. My tree grammar is
</I>&gt;<i> similar to:
</I>&gt;<i> func:    ^(FUNC arg=.) -&gt; ^(Function $arg);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I try to generate a parser a crazy error message appears that a
</I>&gt;<i> template rewriteWildcardLabelRef.st cannot be found. (again, for Java
</I>&gt;<i> everything works as expected)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I don't think that I am quite in sync with the Java target on rewrite of 
wildcards. However, again, you can achieve this with a bit of action 
code.  I will make sure that I have these bugs logged,

Jim

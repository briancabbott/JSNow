Hi!

It actually depends on what to do with the info, you know?

Yup. The grammar is not the major part of our project, so there might be a
chance to share the info if we'd be sure that you are no competition to our
project.

What do you want to do with the parsed data?
 
&gt;<i> 	I can only offer to share my modification back with you and others

I know and I'd be happy to have more eyes to find bugs, but as I said
before: the problem is your project. Any chance to get a little bit more
info?

Ciao,
Andreas

<PRE>Alexander,

The crux of what I say here:
<A HREF="http://www.jazillian.com/articles/treewalkers.html">http://www.jazillian.com/articles/treewalkers.html</A>
is that as the amount of logic needed in your treewalker grows,
the ANTLR treewalker doesn't really help. You start off with
a few simple actions triggered at various points of treewalking,
but then it grows into a large chunk of code where it doesn't really
help to have that code triggered at certain points in a treewalk.
Then you suspect things would be simpler to have your code just
accept an AST as an argument and do its own walking, and throw out
the ANTLR treewalker.

I don't have any good answers on how to &quot;encapsulate my semantic
representation code&quot; better. I've found that when my AST isn't quite
the shape that I want, I have lots of trouble getting ANTLR to create the
AST that I want. But maybe that's just me.

As for your semantic model that you produce from an AST, all I can say
is that I'm now trying to do simple code instrumentation into C code,
and I'm now on my fourth redesign of my model. Just to figure out
a variable's type with all the typedefs, structs, arrays, pointers, etc.
is really hard. Given a declaration &quot;MYTYPE **v[1][2];&quot; and a reference
&quot;*(a.f().v[3] + n)&quot;, what type is the reference? I could spend the
rest of my life staring at C ASTs.

So I feel your pain.
I was also shocked to find that the SQL standard was about 1000 pages,
and the language approaches C++ in complexity. Someone needs to
do for SQL (and C++) what XML did for SGML: strip out the 80% that's
cruft.

I know Alexandre Porcelli was also working on an SQL grammar.

Not sure if you answered this before, but why do you want to use 
heterogenous trees?  The main reason I've seen is for people who want 
to access the node objects directly from C++ instead of through a tree 
grammar.  I've only recently tried to use them with C++ on a contract 
and I agree that antlr's tree building scheme is not easy to 
comprehend.

The more diverse uses we collect the better off we are in the future.  
You're the one who wrote up a whole bunch of notes on tree building 
already, right?  It really helps.

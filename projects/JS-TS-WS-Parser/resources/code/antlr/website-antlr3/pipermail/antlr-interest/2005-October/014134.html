<PRE>All,


An update on my performance issues.  Thanks for all the responses!

We've found two measurable improvements (C++)

(1) Replace =&gt; predicates with {}? predicates.  THIS IS HUGE

We'd done quite a bit of this before, but we got much more aggressive.
 Specifically, replace something like this:
  ( asgn ) =&gt; foo
with this equivalent
  { is_asgn(_t) }? foo
and is_asgn is defined something like this (hope the parens are correct):

  is_asgn!
  returns [bool match_asgn=false]
  :
    ( { _t-&gt;getType() == STMT }?
      #( STMT
        ( { _t-&gt;getType() == EXPR }?
          #( EXPR
            ( { _t-&gt;getType() == ASGN }?
              ASGN
                { match_asgn=true; }
            | . )
          )
        | . )
      )
    | . )
  ;

I suspect there's a more concise way to do this, but this is what
seems to work.  Any suggestions?

(2) Drive to &quot;buildAST=false&quot;  MEASURABLE

We had several passes that mutate specific nodes IN PLACE.  This is
now done with a tree walker using buildAST=false, rather than with a
tree copier (buildAST=true).  By itself, for one pass, not much. 
Systematically, okay.

More if we learn anything else.

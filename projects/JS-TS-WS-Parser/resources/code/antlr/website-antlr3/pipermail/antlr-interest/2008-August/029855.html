True, tabs could get tricky.

Still, couldn't the lexer have a setTabSize() method or 
something?  Default it to 8, since that's the official standard 
tab size (even though most people usually reduce it), and let the 
driver code (or ANTLRworks) modify as needed.  Then ANTLR can 
generate errors using the &quot;true&quot; column number instead of the char 
position, which is fairly meaningless to an end user.

And yes, the handler can be overridden.  But if it behaves as 
people expect out of the box then it'll lead to less confusion, 
especially for ANTLR newbies.  And I think there's already enough 
things to confuse newbies as it is ;)

I guess this means that the token would have to track both column 
number and char position, though, since one cannot be simply 
derived from the other.  (Actually, on that note: does it also 
track the absolute position in the char stream, instead of that 
relative to the start of line?  That could also be useful, if not.)

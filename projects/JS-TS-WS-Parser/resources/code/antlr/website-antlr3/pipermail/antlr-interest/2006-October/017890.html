<PRE>There is a 2-3 year cycle on these discussions; you may not have been around for the last one.  Visitors have their uses; however, they lack the recognition capabilities of grammars.  They also become irrelevant for ANTLR 3--it is easier to iterate over a TreeNodeStream.

Perhaps I'm being thick here, or I haven't been paying attention, but I 
haven't noticed anyone making this argument (and certainly not myself).

I use ANTLR's tree facilities all the time. What I don't do is to use 
tree *grammars*, and it is the argument against grammars that I have 
occasionally seen in this list. This specific AST/tree argument, as I 
understand it (and *not* the translation philosophy argument) is about 
whether the advantages of having a tree grammar outweigh the disadvantages.

The ease of using visitors is not central to that argument. The problem 
is that tree grammars are (currently?) inflexible, but visitors are both 
flexible and trivial, so you should use visitors where appropriate.

<PRE>Dear Jim,

I agree with you. I am on what I believe to be the last &quot;hurdle&quot; of my
grammar:

(simplified)

grammar conjunctive;    //using ANTLRWorks

englishSentence : (adverbPhrase ','?)* simpleSentence;
           adverbPhrase: 'con' simpleSentence | prepPhr;

           simpleSentence : nounPhrase verbPhrase;

                       nounPhrase: ('noun' prepPhr)=&gt; 'noun' prepPhr |
'noun';

                                  prepPhr: 'prep' nounPhrase;

                       verbPhrase: 'verb' complement? adverbPhrase?;

                                   complement: (object object)=&gt; object
object | object;

                                               object:
nounPhrase;

Problem sentence: &quot;con noun verb noun verb&quot; SHOULD give adverbPhrase
simpleSentence (but doesn't, instead consuming the second &quot;noun&quot; as a
*complement* to the verbPhrase, leaving an impossible simpleSentence)

My proposed solution was: Make sure that for something to be an &quot;object&quot;, it
must not be followed by a verbPhrase. This is so that it is not consumed by
a possible *complement?*, IF it is part of a new simpleSentence (i.e. if it
is the subject of a sentence).
I believe my entire grammar is completed, as soon as this problem is fixed.

&gt;<i>  I really think you are beginning to make this way more complicated than
</I>&gt;<i> it really is. You need to step away from your current pursuit of predicates
</I>&gt;<i> and so on and go back to fundamentals. You are trying to get the parser to
</I>&gt;<i> do way more than parser should do. I know it is tempting because it seems
</I>&gt;<i> that the parser will do a lot of validation for you, but it is (generally)
</I>&gt;<i> the wrong way. You want your parser to be as simple as possible, accepting
</I>&gt;<i> anything that is good syntax from a pure string together of tokens point of
</I>&gt;<i> view, THEN apply semantics to see if anything fails. This way you r parser
</I>&gt;<i> rules can accept all the clauses that might be correct (as in all
</I>&gt;<i> syntactically sound combinations), then reject the incorrect ones by
</I>&gt;<i> semantic analysis. Your parser will be simpler, your users will thank you
</I>&gt;<i> for the improved error messages and the whole thing will be easier to
</I>&gt;<i> maintain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basically if you find yourself in the nitty-gritty like this, you are
</I>&gt;<i> probably heading down the wrong path or flogging a dead horse ;-) You could
</I>&gt;<i> use backtracking mode for this, but then your error messages will be even
</I>&gt;<i> more arbitrary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the predicate, don&#8217;t forget that the prediction will still select a
</I>&gt;<i> rule and try the predicate. Perhaps you could use gated predicates on the
</I>&gt;<i> &#8216;invocation&#8217; of the rule so that it is not &#8216;called&#8217; if it won&#8217;t match, but
</I>&gt;<i> once you are in a rule you have to do something like this;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> r : (pred1)=&gt;rule1
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  | (pred2)=&gt;rule2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  | // neither of the above, match nothing
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But then you start need to set state flags, test the flags, etc. You soon
</I>&gt;<i> end up with a lot more work than just using a semantic analysis phase after
</I>&gt;<i> the initial parse. You will also have to deal with the absence of flags due
</I>&gt;<i> to syntax errors and so on, whereas if you defer to semantic analysis as a
</I>&gt;<i> separate phase, then you will be able to rely on a sound syntax.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1)      Don&#8217;t try to influence the paths the parser takes &#8211; let the tokens
</I>&gt;<i> do that;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2)      Afterwards, in the tree walk, determine whether the various
</I>&gt;<i> combinations of clauses are correct, issue good errors here if not;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3)      Generate code (or whatever it is you are doing) in the knowledge
</I>&gt;<i> that it is all good from here.

</I>&gt;<i> completely
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, so even if all syntactic predicates have failed in a particular
</I>&gt;<i> rule, that rule is still included as &quot;matched&quot; in that analysis! Is this
</I>&gt;<i> true or are my tests wrong? This is not what I hoped. I was hoping that upon
</I>&gt;<i> complete failure of all syntactic predicates in a rule, the rule becomes
</I>&gt;<i> disregarded, and that &quot;disregarding&quot; is cascaded as far up as possible, and
</I>&gt;<i> an alternative path is attempted. Is this how it's works, or am I missing
</I>&gt;<i> something? Or is there a way, using actions, to &quot;force&quot; the exiting of a
</I>&gt;<i> particular rule as if it had not been matched at all?
</I>&gt;<i>

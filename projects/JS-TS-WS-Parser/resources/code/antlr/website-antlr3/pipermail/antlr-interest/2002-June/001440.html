<PRE>Hi All,

I am having a *very* hard time debugging my ANTLR grammar. In order 
to do my PREPROCESSOR things, I created a sub-class of the Lexer 
defined in the *.g gile and did overrode nextToken(). So, I use the 
Lexer subclass with the Parser not the ANTLR generated one. Oh, I 
also use a TokenStreamHiddenFilter in between them.

Problem is, ParseView won't work unless I am using both a ANTLR-
generated Lexer and Parser. Now, Scott mentions that this won't work 
unil he develops some adapters using the Debugger API. Has any one 
developed any such adapters?

Is the Debugger API documented anywhere?. Can anybody offer any 
guidance so that I can write this adapters myself?

Any help appreciated.

Micheal

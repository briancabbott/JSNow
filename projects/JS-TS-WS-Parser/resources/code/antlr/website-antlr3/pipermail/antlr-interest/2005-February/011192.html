<PRE>Hey all!

LOOKING FOR SOME GUINEA PIGS...
SUMMARY
=======
If you have an ANTLR Java parser, AND use Eclipse 3.0.x or 3.1Mx, AND would
like to help me ensure I didn't break ANTLR with some debugging and XML
changes, please email me: <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">scott at javadude.com</A>


THE DETAILS
===========

I'm back from my long absence of ANTLR-related fun! I convinced some folks
at work to try ANTLR for XML parsing which started a whole &quot;let's make
things easier&quot; binge for me...

(Note that my email address has changed several times since I wrote
ParseView. I saw in the mailing list that some people have had trouble
reaching me. Use <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">scott at javadude.com...</A>)


I've done some major tinkering with ANTLR and the ANTLR-Eclipse plugin to do
the following:

Debugging-Related Stuff
=======================
I fixed ParseView and added JSR-45 debugging support...

* Made ParseView work again and integrated with the ANTLR distro
* Simplified the debugging API for ParseView (reducing some ANTLR debug
code)
* Added JSR-45 support to ANTLR so you can walk through the grammar in the
eclipse debugger
  (see <A HREF="http://javadude.com/misc/antlr-debug/antlr-debug.html">http://javadude.com/misc/antlr-debug/antlr-debug.html</A> for a quick
demo)
* Added an JSR-45 SMAP installer to the ANTLR-eclipse plugin
  (this is based off some code from Apache Tomcat, so if this is released as

   part of Torsten's ANTLR-Eclipse plugin we need to figure out if there are
   licensing issues... otherwise I can make it a separate eclipse plugin w/
   an Apache license, but it's cleaner to integrate with ANTLR-Eclipse and
   avoid having the user add Smap support to the project as well as ANTLR
   support)



XML-Related Stuff
=================
I started using XPA, but I really wanted something that did normal XML
validation against a DTD or schema. (With XPA, I'd basically have to emulate
the same validation in a grammar.) I also wanted some simpler syntax in the
ANTLR grammar.

So, I created an XMLTokenStream that accepts a SAX parser and runs it to
fill a buffer with token which is then used for an ANTLR parser to pull
from. (The buffer has high and low water marks so it doesn't suck the whole
file into memory at once).

* Created an XMLTokenStream class that takes a SAX parser (configured
however you like) as a scanner, creates tokens for the start/end tags and
content, and can be attached to a parser

* Added an xmlTag rule option 
    webApp options {xmlTag=&quot;web-app&quot;;}
  This automatically generates refs to the start and end tag for web-app, as
well as 
  setting up attribute reference support
* Added &quot;@name&quot; support to reference attributes in code
  You can write code like
     {  createPerson(@name, @address, @phone); }
  in a rule that has an xmlTag option. The attributes will be extracted from
  that tag

* Added xmlNamespaceMapping options to the grammar to allow prefix use for
tags ref'd in rules

I've still got some more work to do to make the JSR-45 support follow rule
references, but it's looking pretty good so far.


REQUEST FOR TESTERS!
====================
All of this required some work on the ANTLR parser and the java code
generator. I'd like to get the warm fuzzies that I didn't blow anything up,
so...

To anyone who has a working parser AND uses Eclipse 3.0.x or 3.1Mx, if
you're willing to run a quick test to see if things behave the same, please
email me: <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">scott at javadude.com.</A> (Note that you'll need to answer a challenge
at knowspam.net for me to get the email.)

I will send a zip containing the modified eclipse plugins for ANTLR.


MY TO DO LIST...
================
I've still got some work to do, so release of all of this is probably a few
weeks to a month away...

* Add rule-ref support in SMAPs for grammar debugging. (I've started with
it, but I'm having some silly little &quot;off-by-one&quot; problems in the mapping...
Grrr... Arg...)

* Add a token buffer &quot;spy&quot; to ParseView

* Add checking for invalid breakpoint locations (right now you can set
breakpoints anywhere in a grammar but they're ignored if they're outside
actions)

* If I have time, convert ParseView to an Eclipse plugin with some
nicer-looking views

* Work with Terence and Torsten to get all of this in the official ANTLR and
ANTLR-Eclipse releases

* Figure out who else is working on ANTLR (I hear there's a 2.8.0 in dev?)
and merge their changes in

I'd like to eventually create a new ANTLR editor for Eclipse based on the
Structured Source Editor (SSE) that comes with the WebTools project from
Eclipse.org. That would support all sorts of wonderful Java stuff
development inside the action code like code completion and so forth...


Whew! That was a lot to say...

Later,
-- Scott

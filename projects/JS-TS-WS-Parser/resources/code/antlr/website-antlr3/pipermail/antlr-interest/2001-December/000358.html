&gt;<i> Hey there buddy,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Tammy, Cassidy and I were thinking of you and wanted to wish you the best
</I>&gt;<i> for the holiday season. Hope you are doing well and keep in touch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Rudy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PS. Here is our Xmas letter:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 'Twas the week before Christmas with internet shopping.
</I>&gt;<i> Tammy and Chris had UPS hopping.
</I>&gt;<i> A thousand bulbs were planted by Tammy with care,
</I>&gt;<i> In hopes that Spring soon would be there.
</I>&gt;<i> Cassidy was settled and in love with preschool.
</I>&gt;<i> She thinks letters, numbers, and friends are real cool.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Chris is busy as an elf in his workshop,
</I>&gt;<i> A million things to do before he can stop.
</I>&gt;<i> With a pergola and a library to create,
</I>&gt;<i> Medicine cabinets and a kitchen table to make.
</I>&gt;<i> There is moulding to put up and to paint,
</I>&gt;<i> Thinking of it all makes him want to faint.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For help with the backyard there have many to praise.
</I>&gt;<i> Friends came for visits and were worked like slaves.
</I>&gt;<i> Then what to our wondering eyes should appear,
</I>&gt;<i> A beautiful backyard that makes our hearts give cheer.
</I>&gt;<i> With a large brick patio and borders filled with flowers,
</I>&gt;<i> &#179;To front yard&#178; yells Tammy &#179;Dark will be here in an hour!&#178;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> More rapid than Martha, the ideas they came.
</I>&gt;<i> Tammy&#185;s working from dawn, drove Chris insane.
</I>&gt;<i> &#179;Now Chris! Now Cassidy! Now Oscar! Now Frodo!
</I>&gt;<i> Plant Roses! Plant Smokebushes! Plant grasses! Pronto!
</I>&gt;<i> Pile on the compost and don&#185;t be slow.
</I>&gt;<i> We have to get this done before the first snow!&#178;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But as Autumn leaves began to fall
</I>&gt;<i> Tammy decided she wasn&#185;t done at all.
</I>&gt;<i> Away to the Hamptons, Tammy she flew.
</I>&gt;<i> She plotted and planted and redid their yard too.
</I>&gt;<i> Chris also was busy, he is not one to slack.
</I>&gt;<i> He took up scuba, and achieved in Karate, a belt that is black.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We were out of breath and needed some rest.
</I>&gt;<i> We bought a little trailer we think is the best.
</I>&gt;<i> It is shaped like an egg and is seventeen feet.
</I>&gt;<i> It has a microwave, a shower, and central air for heat.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cassidy, wow over the year she grew.
</I>&gt;<i> She is taking ballet, tap, and tumbling too.
</I>&gt;<i> She finally sleeps and lets us rest,
</I>&gt;<i> For that alone we think she is the best.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Her eyes full of mischief, her laughter so fun!
</I>&gt;<i> She&#185;s cheeky and silly all rolled into one.
</I>&gt;<i> She speaks loads of words and never stops talking.
</I>&gt;<i> We hope Santa leaves a volume control in our stocking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At Nana and Papa&#185;s the family will meet.
</I>&gt;<i> Tammy will be baking many wonderful treats.
</I>&gt;<i> With Auntie Kelly, Uncle Ted and Cousin Sean there as well.
</I>&gt;<i> This Christmas is sure to be swell.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But we must say goodbye from our home to yours,
</I>&gt;<i> Merry Christmas to all, and to all our amour.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
-- 
Be Happy, 
Enjoy Life.
with love 
shiva.

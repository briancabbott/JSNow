<PRE>A few more comments: 

[...]
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (but I  would definitely keep the multiple grammars apart).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I really do not want to keep the grammars separate.
</I>
Well, this seems to contradict what the language looks like. A parser
grammar, IMHO, is not the point to retrofit your wishes into the language:
If the language is as crooked as yours (if I understand you correctly), your
grammar should faithfully mirror this crookedness.
Only at the level of ASTs can you go for your &quot;abstract syntax&quot;, which can
(and should) be as beautiful as possible.

The other possibility is that you have (or there is) a single-level sensible
grammar for that language which you can directly (not some parser with
re-feed/stream change concepts - that's NOT part of standard grammars
[contextfree, ENBF, whatever]!!). I doubt this, because whoever would have
written this grammar would have jumped out of the window and prayed for a
redesign of the language ...

Still, I do have an idea using the Emit() functionality of lexers to do a
sort of &quot;shove those inner symbols up to the single parser&quot; ... maybe I like
to try this also over my holidays :-)

&gt;<i> BSDL was 
</I>&gt;<i> designed so 
</I>&gt;<i> you could do either.  I want to logically keep the grammar in 
</I>&gt;<i> something 
</I>&gt;<i> resembling the form it really should have been in the first 
</I>&gt;<i> place.  
</I>
As I said above, I think this is not a goal to be pursued: The
(lexer+parser) grammar should *describe* what is out there, not abstract
away from it into some wishful thinking direction.

&gt;<i> Understand what you are getting at, however, this is prohibitted
</I>&gt;<i> in the language itself, fortunately.   Concatentation of litteral
</I>&gt;<i> strings is the only form of expression allowed.   
</I>
... including white space and comments (as you examples show)! - so it's not
that trivial; and maybe there are preprocessor directives, which could also
crop up inside such a string etc.??? - and what else you have outside the
&quot;conceptual grammar&quot;?
At some point, my  3-pass suggestion will be easier than trying to write
some lexer-level machine which handles all those things at once.
But of course, this is hopefully only a horror scenario ...

&gt;<i> However, I think that parsing inside of strings has a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> applications besides BSDL and needs to be supported and documented.
</I>
... therefore I tried to come up some an example code.
I hope I showed how a two-grammar (or N-grammar) machine can be done; I'll
think about a 1-grammar version a little ...

&gt;<i> Needing, for example, 20 different grammars because you have 
</I>&gt;<i> 20 different
</I>&gt;<i> string types, though, would leave a lot to be desired.
</I>
In all cases I know (printf or other formatting grammar inside strings;
regex grammar inside strings; Javadoc inside /** comments; C#'s XMLdoc
inside /// comments), it is actually *necessary* to have different grammars
- even the tokenization is different (think of printf vs. C).

You case of a language with nested strings where much of the core
tokenization inside and outside is the same is, I would risk to state, a
very odd example with almost no parallels anywhere else.

Regards
Harald

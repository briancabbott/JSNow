Which ones? Sounds a bit like using ANTLR 3 is like walking a  
minefield, doesn't it?

&gt;<i> Is the problem design flaws that just don't have a

I'm sorry, somehow that sentence strikes as a bit non-constructive. I  
might be touchy, but I see problems like this one as minor issues not  
&quot;design flaws&quot;.
I also strongly object to call ANTLR 3.1 as being in &quot;prototype stage&quot;.
This question could easily have been framed as:
&quot;I'm trying to do n+=(A? B) but it doesn't seem to work, instead it  
adds null to the list. Is this a known problem?&quot;
instead of going the slightly more aggressive route.

&gt;<i> This particular feature (being able to assign an alias to an  
</I>&gt;<i> expression) is
</I>&gt;<i> really useful, but would be more so if it worked completely. Is the  
</I>&gt;<i> intent

</I>&gt;<i> produce

and for this one:

And now that I look, I find both <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org:8888/browse/ANTLR-313">http://www.antlr.org:8888/browse/ANTLR-313</A> 
  and the associated email thread from Jul/30-31.
Are you seriously expecting people (effectively Ter) to drop  
everything else and implement that in two weeks?

Of course, reporting bugs and shortcomings is fine and very much  
appreciated, don't get me wrong. After all that's what drives a project.

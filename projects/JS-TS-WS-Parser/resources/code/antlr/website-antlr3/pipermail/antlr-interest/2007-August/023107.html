Well, there are other targets, you know...

And while Ter does the main work on ANTLR it actually happens that we
guys talk about things. So far the main reason the C++ target (for  
example) isn't
there yet, is that Jim just recently took over. I'm sure he'd  
appreciate help with
that (that probably is true for any other target as well).

I'm not sure that the C target cannot be used with ANTLRWorks  
(actually it would suprise
me a lot if it doesn't work). It's true, you cannot use the  
interpreter mode and ANTLRWorks
can't compile your recognizers, but that's true with any target other  
than Java. It's
just to much work and there are too many details to make it feasible.

What you can do, though, is to use the -debug switch of ANTLR and  
then &quot;Debug remote...&quot;
in ANTLRWorks. I use that with my ObjC stuff all the time. I'm pretty  
sure that's implemented
in the C target as well.

cheers,
-k

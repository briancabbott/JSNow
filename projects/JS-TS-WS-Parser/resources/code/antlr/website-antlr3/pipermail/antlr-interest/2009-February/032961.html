&quot;backtrack=true&quot; options because of LL(*) conflicts. I said &quot;I think, it 
worked&quot;, because I don't know exactly that it worked. The treewalker 
didn't give me an error, but I didn't look at the tree yet that it is 
correct or not. Now I try to learn using the parser and the treewalker.

</I>I'm studying now how the parser and tree walker works. After that I want 
to learn ANTLR grammar and the other things from the book (I haven't buy 
it, but I'll)

Thanks for helping. This gives me more desire to learn compilers and antlr.

Isn't Prashant talking about incremental parsing (as opposed to
incremental compilation)? I guess incremental parsing with all related
semantic checking and stuff is way more complex than eclipse/jdt is
doing incremental compilation. It has no &quot;delta&quot; ASTs/nodes but whole
delta compilation units as far as I know. When a compilation unit has
changed, it parses it from beginning to end and builds a whole new AST,
(not just the lines that changed modifying single nodes). The
synchronization happens on a level above Prashant's talking and should
be much simpler to manage. Please correct me if I am wrong. 

And yes, eclipse java copmpiler/parser is fast. I guess that comes from
it's jikes heritage, whose reputation isn't that bad in terms of
speed...

Ingo

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, there are two concepts here:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) incremental compilation
</I>&gt;<i> 2) editor parsing for decoration &amp; &quot;instant errors&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Have you tried running a full build of anything recently? Most large
</I>&gt;<i> projects take several minutes (3-5 at least) or more. The incremental
</I>&gt;<i> building in eclipse has probably saved me a good year of development time
</I>&gt;<i> since it came out... (And I'm not kidding... If I had to go back to
</I>&gt;<i> rebuilding by hand every once in a while, then figure out the context of
</I>&gt;<i> each error, I'd go nuts...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Incremental compilation is not about syntax highlighting (though the java
</I>&gt;<i> editor updates an AST every time you pause). It's about:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) shorter build times
</I>&gt;<i> 2) instantly seeing what's wrong
</I>&gt;<i> 3) keeping in the context of the problems when they appear (you know what
</I>&gt;<i> you just changed)
</I>&gt;<i> 4) ensuring you only have a few errors to wrestle with at a time (instead of
</I>&gt;<i> compiling every hour or two to find several and not remember what you were
</I>&gt;<i> doing)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Worst case, the entire workspace is rebuilt, and that's incredibly rare. (If
</I>&gt;<i> you were able to edit the &quot;Object&quot; class in java it would cause it, but
</I>&gt;<i> there are very few classes that just about everything needs, though you can
</I>&gt;<i> cause a chain reaction. I've rarely seen a long incremental build in eclipse
</I>&gt;<i> unless the tools are messed up -- the web tools, for example, have some
</I>&gt;<i> problems that trigger massive recompilation.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Incremental compilation is usually triggered on save (that's what eclipse
</I>&gt;<i> does), at which point all impacted classes in a workspace are recompiled.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Editor parsing only affects the file you're editing, not the potentially
</I>&gt;<i> impacted code outside that file. It usually triggers this when the user
</I>&gt;<i> pauses. (If you notice you can type several words and they'll stay black,
</I>&gt;<i> then when you pause they get highlighted). The editor parsing is
</I>&gt;<i> significantly faster b/c it only affects a single file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Incremental compilation is a good thing, but yes, it's quite complex to
</I>&gt;<i> implement...

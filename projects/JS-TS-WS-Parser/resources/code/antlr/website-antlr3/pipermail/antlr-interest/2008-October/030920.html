Well, in fact I am just writing a transliterator, and since AND and OR 
are each associative-commutative, and since the target language does 
support them as multiary connectives, it's all perfectly fine.

It's perhaps worth mentioning, though certainly tangential, that at 
least in certain circles of logic and theorem proving, the generalized 
form of AND and OR are assumed (and that includes nullary and unary 
forms, as well as those with more than two subformulas) and so the 
strictly binary form is _not_ the most useful one for the kind of 
processing that I have to do.


Infix notation is an illusion...

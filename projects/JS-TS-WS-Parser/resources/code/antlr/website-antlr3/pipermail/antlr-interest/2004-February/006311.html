What happens is that the lookahead set for statement() now includes the lookahead set for statementComplete, so the answer is 
&quot;yes&quot;.

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BTW, why are you doing single statement matches?  If you are doing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interpretation of phrases, I have a string InputBuffer class which can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; refilled.  That will be included with the 2.8 distribution--I need it to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support testing--but that won't be until after 2.7.3 is officially
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; released.  I can send you a copy if you would like.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, what I want to do is parse some user code, which must be a number of

</I>&gt;<i> statements. Should work fine with the TokenStreamRewriteEngine by Terence... 
</I>&gt;<i> So I think an InputBuffer which can be refilled is not of much use in this 
</I>&gt;<i> case... Unless I'm missing your point?
</I>
No--I was just curious as to why you would be matching single statements.

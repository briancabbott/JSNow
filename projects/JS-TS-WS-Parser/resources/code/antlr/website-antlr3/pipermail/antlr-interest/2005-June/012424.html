<PRE>I have to add, though, that just because it hasn't been tested in court
doesn't mean that it hasn't been tested. The GPL has a long history of
even big companies throwing in the towel without a fight when
threatened.
 
And the GPL has been tested in court. On several occasions.
 
But yes, I do know that it's not the licence being used for Antlr ...
 
Cheers,
Wol

If lawsuits could not be used as an element of corporate warfare, length
would not matter.  As it is, one goal of an Open Source license is to
make lawsuits untenable, whether by secondary (and primary) developers
against users or by users against developers or by third parties (as in
the SCO/IBM case).  With lawyers involved, clauses get added to
eliminate sources of lawsuits (and it doesn't matter if the sources
would be spurious or not:  lawsuits can tie up day-to-day operations of
a business) and the license grows.

 

For some perspective on how Open Source lawsuits can be used in
corporate warfare, see

<A HREF="http://informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=160902263">http://informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=160902263</A>

and other articles relating to the SCO/IBM Linux lawsuit.  Also, take a
look at

<A HREF="http://www.cioinsight.com/article2/0,1397,1779913,00.asp">http://www.cioinsight.com/article2/0,1397,1779913,00.asp</A>

for an example of copyright abuse in other arenas.

 

Fortunately, Open Source software usually benefits all parties involved
so lawsuits are uncommon.  Unfortunately, that also means that Open
Source licenses have not adequately been tested in court.

&gt;<i> &gt; Is it important to have long licence document to make it valid?

<PRE>You can use JBurg to do the matching &amp; optimization type stuff.  See Ter's
lecture <A HREF="http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~parrt/course/652/labs/jburg.html.">http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~parrt/course/652/labs/jburg.html.</A>

Not sure about how to link in the theorem proving aspect of that stuff
though.  RML as described seems like a somewhat incomplete beast judging
from the thesis on the open source modelica implementation.  I couldn't find
too much written about it, maybe I was looking in the wrong places.  I guess
I need an example a bit more compelling than addition to see what the
advantages of RML are.

Subject: [antlr-interest] High level semantic analysis


I'm not much of an expert on building compilers, but I came across something
that I thought was quite interesting and I was wondering if anyone here
would care to comment on the applicability of these ideas to ANTLR.
Specifically, I recognize the the treewalker functionality in the ANTLR is
very nice way to explore and translate ASTs.  I was wondering if anybody is
interested in adding some higher-level functionality like what is described
in this report:

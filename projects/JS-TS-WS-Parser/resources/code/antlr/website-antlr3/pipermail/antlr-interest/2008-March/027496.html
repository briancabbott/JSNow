<PRE>Chris,

 

I've written an complete ECMAScript compiant grammar recently.

I've struggled with the following issues:

-          Unicode identifiers

-          Regular expression literals

-          Semicolon insertion

 

For the semicolon insertion issue I've taken the following approach.
The line terminators are left on the hidden channel. In the parser the
semicolon (e.g. in statements) is defined as a rule. In this rule I scan
the token stream for line terminators and promote the first encountered
to the default channel. Line terminator are also an alternative in this
rule. Something like this:

 

semic:

@init

{

                int marker = input.mark();

                promoteEOL();

}

                : SEMIC

                | EOL

                | RBRACE { input.rewind(marker); }

                | EOF

                ;

 

The grammar also scans for line terminators in places where the
specification states there are none allowed (e.g. between &quot;return&quot; and
the following optional expression in the return statement).

 

Hope this helps.

 

Regards,

patrick.

The approach I took was to keep LT tokens on the default channel, for
the benefit of the few rules where line terminators are important. For
example, the ECMAScript spec defines a return statement as follows:

'return' [no LineTerminator here] Expression[optional] ';'

In the ANTLR grammar, this becomes:

returnStatement : 'return' expression (LT | ';')! ;

You can see that the statement may end either with a semicolon or with a
line terminator, which the ECMAScript spec permits. This appears to work
just fine. The only part I find annoying is that because the LT tokens
are not on the hidden channel, all of the other rules need to deal with
them too. For example, the ifStatement rule looks like this:

ifStatement : 'if' LT!* '(' LT!* expression LT!* ')' LT!* statement
(LT!* 'else' LT!* statement)? ;

when it would be much clearer if it looked like this:

ifStatement : 'if' '(' expression ')' statement ('else' statement)? ;

This affects all of the parser rules, which makes the grammar less
readable. I did think about performing some filtering of the token
stream between the lexing and parsing phases, but the rules for
automatic semicolon insertion defined by the ECMAScript are a bit nasty.
It's just too difficult to actually determine where the virtual
semicolons should be, without the grammatical context that only the
parsing stage can provide. In any case, I think the grammar would be
less useful if it required any special runtime tweaks to make it work.

I think what would really solve the problem would be to have the LT
tokens on the hidden channel by default, and then dynamically switch
them to the default channel only for those rules that require it. I'm
afraid I'm not yet familiar enough with channels and token streams to
know if this is even possible. My guess is that it probably isn't, but
it can't hurt to ask.

Chris

P.S. I've just remembered that although the grammar compiles just fine,
I couldn't get it to work with the ANTLRWorks debugger. It seems like
it's the huge Identifier lexer rule that causes the problem - I had to
temporarily replace it with something simpler in order to persuade the
debugger to work. I presume this is a bug in ANTLRWorks - if anyone is
interested in this, I can provide more information, perhaps off-line.

you're

the usual

'hide'

grammar

the LT

them
	&gt;       only in the few rules that require it?

	It is most likely not kosher, but if you can look at an LT in a
sequence

anything
	but the adjoining tokens) then some sort of preprocessor (I'm
thinking:
	lex, filter tokens into new lex stream, parse) might be able to
convert
	what is needed. You might call the filter a TokenSedStream or
something
	like that. I did something like that (but with the text) to deal
with
	indentation sensitivity in my only attempt with ANTLR. As I
said, not
	kosher, but if all else fails &quot;You gotta go with what works.&quot;

<PRE>Since you asked :) there is another thing related to reuse that may (or 
may) not need be improved.

I need to collect all parse errors generated during parsing (instead of 
just printing them which is the default behaviour). To do that I've 
added a @rulecatch in my top-level grammar and an ArrayList in the 
@members. Again, I'd expect that the @rulecatch would propagate to the 
imported grammars (which is not the case).

Also I hoped that the delegate would have a standard-name field e.g. 
parentParser which I could use to add the errors caught in sub-grammars 
to the ArrayList of the parent parser. I can still do this (again via 
reflection) but it would help if the parent parser had a fixed name in 
the delegate.

Cheers,
Dimitrios

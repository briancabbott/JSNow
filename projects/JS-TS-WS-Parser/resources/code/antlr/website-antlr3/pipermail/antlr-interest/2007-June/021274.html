Try tacking the issues one by one.  There are a number of errors in  
the grammar I believe:


ANTLR Parser Generator  Version 3.0 (May 17, 2007)  1989-2007
warning(205): T.g:167:4: ANTLR could not analyze this decision in  
rule booleanFactor; often this is because of recursive rule  
references visible from the left edge of alternatives.  ANTLR will re- 
analyze the decision with a fixed lookahead of k=1.  Consider using  
&quot;options {k=1;}&quot; for that decision and possibly adding a syntactic  
predicate.
warning(205): T.g:175:3: ANTLR could not analyze this decision in  
rule booleanPrimary; often this is because of recursive rule  
references visible from the left edge of alternatives.  ANTLR will re- 
analyze the decision with a fixed lookahead of k=1.  Consider using  
&quot;options {k=1;}&quot; for that decision and possibly adding a syntactic  
predicate.

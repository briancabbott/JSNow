<PRE>
The problem of maintaining one grammar with language
dependent actions may be partly due to our inclination
to think of grammars as simple text files.  Imagine that
we used a text editor which could maintain multiple
versions of a file.  Such things exist for technical
documentation.  I remember reading that this was used
for airplane maintenance manuals so that common
features were updated for all airplanes, while
new models could have custom sections.  A printout
was customized according to the model selected.

Another way of looking at this, is that we can
have multiple views of a grammar. Textual vs. graphical.
The graphical emphasizes the ebnf while the textual
emphasizes the actions.  Text view A is c++ while
text view B is java.

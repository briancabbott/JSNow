<PRE>So, I went to markmail.org and typed in Maven. This gave me 365 messages, 133 of which are from me. Being too MANY hits, I added the word problem. The first hit against that search gives:
 
<A HREF="http://markmail.org/message/z5e4dtwdml3g4q5u">http://markmail.org/message/z5e4dtwdml3g4q5u</A>
 
Which gives you the answer. I guess it isn&#8217;t mostly blank after all.
 
You can also use markmail to find:
 
<A HREF="http://antlr.markmail.org/search/?q=maven+archetype">http://antlr.markmail.org/search/?q=maven+archetype</A>
 
The Google search:
 
antlr maven archetype
 
Returns the ANTLR page about archetypes as the first hit and 279,000 other pages, at least some of which reference it. If I just type &#8216;antlr maven&#8217; then I get some false leads, but I instantly notices that some of these leads are on antlr.org so I use: site:antrl.org and the top hit is a wiki page referring to the official documentation, which as far as I know contains everything you need except archetype details.
 
So I am guessing that you have your own versions of markmail.org and google. But, if you don&#8217;t like the docs then nobody is forcing you to use it.

Missed this earlier.

No, actually I didn't.
 
A 10 second google search will point you at:

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Building+ANTLR+Projects+with+Maven">http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Building+ANTLR+Projects+with+Maven</A>

If you have any pointers to why this does not give you step by step instructions, please let me know and I will try and make it more foolproof.

I guess the fact that this page didn't show up in my Google search when I went looking for it might have been a contributing factor?  You know, kind of like how your other link, when I searched on &quot;maven&quot; gave me a page that was three-quarters blank?

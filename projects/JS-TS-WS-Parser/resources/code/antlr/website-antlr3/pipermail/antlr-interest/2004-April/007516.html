Well, while I don't see problem with licence, it still might be hard, as 
boost smartpointers seem to make use of some other boost stuff. And you'd 
have to deal also with boost autoconfiguration stuff (sarpointers make haevy 
use of compiler &amp; platform specific tunig persent in the boost)

Well, it's not that bad it's only nonstandard ;)

Answered to that in the other post... But once more: informs us, when you're 
playing with it again!

&gt;<i> The archive might turn some up in discussions with

</I>
Must look there...

[snip]
&gt;<i> A disadvantage of your reference counter is btw that we have to drop
</I>&gt;<i> support for some compilers due to the use of the member template (but I
</I>&gt;<i> guess that's not that big a deal except if VC6 has trouble with it, then
</I>&gt;<i> again those conversions can be implemented manually if the hierarchy isn't
</I>&gt;<i> too big)
</I>
I'm pretty sure MSVC 6.0 supports member templates, it can't deal with 
friend templates, though (but that should not be a problem).

&gt;<i> Another thing that makes me hate the smartpointers is that current gdb's
</I>&gt;<i> still segfault like hell around their use :((((
</I>
Is it really that bad? I was debugging my smartpointer library with gdb, and 
didn't encounter any strange problems (anyhing behind typical bad stuff of 
the gdb + additional graphical interface combination).

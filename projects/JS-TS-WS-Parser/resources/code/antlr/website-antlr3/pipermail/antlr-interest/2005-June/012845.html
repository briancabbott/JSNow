<PRE>&gt;<i> I like this and think it is superior to the parsing part of

</I>
I'm not doing any tree transformation. I'm planning on keeping this separate
from XPA, though if you're interested we could work on putting tree
transformation in ANTXR, or set up XPA as a separate tree transformer that
could be integrated with ANTXR output. I must admit I haven't look at the
XPA tree transformation support very closely, so I don't know how easy this
would be. If we found the right place for hooks, XPA and ANTXR could work
together quite nicely.

The ANTLR AST support still exists in ANTXR, and ANTXR should be able to
create trees. I haven't tried it yet, though, so I may have inadvertently
broken something. I don't think that was hit though. Standard ANTLR tree
parsers should work on ANTXR output, though again, I haven't tried it.

About 6 weeks ago I realized things would be a lot more user friendly if I
split from ANTLR. Ter wasn't enthusiastic about it, but understood that it
could be better served that way.

I now have it working with XMLPULL parsers as well (sooooo much easier than
the wonderful thread synch we did for SAX, but the validation support is
weak in most of the XMLPULL parsers I looked at). I've got simple token
stream versions for Xerces, Crimson and kxml so users don't need to
configure them for basic XML parsing. They can still use the more complex
sax and xmlpull streams if full control is desired.

(I pulled out the non-Java code generators. Eventually I may add them back
in if I get the chance to learn XML parsing on those languages.)

What I *really* need to do is an XML Schema-&gt;ANTXR grammar generator...

Later,
-- Scott

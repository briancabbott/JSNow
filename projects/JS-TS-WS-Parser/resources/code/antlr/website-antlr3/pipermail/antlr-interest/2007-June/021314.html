<PRE>Ooops!. Scratch my comments about the 2.x examples using that idiom. I'm
apprently remembering something else. The csharp_v1 example (only available
for C# in v2.x) has a CSharpLexer.g file that you could look at instead.

David,
 
Have you tried declaring your literals (i.e. &quot;__asm&quot;, &quot;_asm&quot;...etc) using
the tokens {...} construct in ANTLR 2.x. You would then need to set the
testLiterals option to 'true' for your ID rule. This ensures that all match
ID strings are checked against your literals.
 
Many of the 2.x examples (e.g. the Java parser which is also available in
C++) can serve as an example of this idiom. They declare keywords in the
tokens {..} section and set the testLiterals option for their
ID/IDENT/IDENTIFIER rule.
 
Micheal
 
PS    Any plans to port your C++ grammar to v3?. The C target is maturing
and is seems very performant.

Subject: [antlr-interest] ANTLR 2.7 Lexer problem


Thanks to those who replied to my lexer problem about coping with whitespace
in the lexer described in Digest vol 31 issue 22 of 6 June. As suggested
parsing specifically for white space solved this problem.
 
However, I am still getting an ambiguity warning between ( __asm | _asm |
asm ) and ID. I don't want to accept this because it looks as though
something could be wrong (although it does in fact work).
 
I have tried the following options but they don't work (Cut down to minimum
for demonstration).
 
AsmStatements
 :
 (options{generateAmbigWarnings = false;}:
  (&quot;__asm&quot;|&quot;_asm&quot;|&quot;asm&quot;) //etc.
 )
 ;

AsmStatements
 options{generateAmbigWarnings = false;}
 :
  (&quot;__asm&quot;|&quot;_asm&quot;|&quot;asm&quot;) // etc.
 ;

Antlr accepts these statements but I still get lexical nondeterminsim
between rules AsmStatements and ID.
 
I can't find any similar example in the ANTLR2 documentation and I would be
grateful if someone could let me know what I doing wrong.
 
Thanks.
 
David Wigg

Did you have a parser rule like

start
   :  WS
   |  FOO
   ;

in your example? Otherwise ANTLR may choose the superset rule in favor
of subset rule on its own.

&gt;<i> At first I mistakenly thought that the lexer would try lexer rules in
</I>&gt;<i> order (WS first and then FOO), but it doesn't. It calls a predict method
</I>&gt;<i> and the predication always goes for FOO without fail. My understanding
</I>&gt;<i> is now that the prediction method favors a greedy match, and so even
</I>&gt;<i> typing &quot;     \n&quot; into the test rig is enough to make it prefer FOO over
</I>&gt;<i> WS (because of the trailing newline). I played around with greedy=false
</I>&gt;<i> but that yielded single characters rather than a string of
</I>&gt;<i> non-whitespace characters. In any case, exploring the issue I eventually
</I>&gt;<i> got down to a minimal lexer containing that lone OTHER rule...
</I>
With greedy=false you can't get token with more than one character,
unless you have some kind of stopping character. After all, the WS rule
is satisfied with just one space.

WS: ' '+ ~' ';


With this rule WS should get all consecutive spaces. But I haven't
tested if FOO is still chosen over WS. Maybe

start
   : (WS)=&gt; WS
   |  FOO
   ;

is still needed.

Best regards,

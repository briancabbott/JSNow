Hi all,

I'm relatively new to AntlrWorld, having (re)discovered it only a few 
weeks ago, and then discovered StringTemplate, which has since consumed 
most of my waking hours.

I can't really follow the hairy details of this thread, but I think I 
see an abstract pattern.  Please tell me if the following makes sense:

The core issue is design strategy for language transformation.  If we 
can think of a continuum of design options, then (possibly) we can put 
the Antlr strategy on one end, and the (Jazillion?) on the other.

(I'm being very schematic here; perhaps the actual workings of antlr and 
jazillion don't fit the schema.  Please advise.)

We can call the Antlr approach &quot;source-driven transformation&quot;; the 
Jazillion approach &quot;target-driven&quot; transformation.

By &quot;source-driven&quot;, I mean that the process looks sth like:

     a.  write grammar to parse source language
     b.  generate source AST
     c.  write (tree) transformation grammar that attaches actions to 
(AST) productions, producing either:

         c1.  a target AST that can then be run through other 
transformers, in particular a pretty-printer; or
         c2.  a text in the target language

So in practice a source-driven strategy means writing code to feed into 
a parser generator.  The driver will invoke the parser on a source text. 
  Grammatical structure of the source text controls processing.

By &quot;target-driven&quot; I mean a process that looks something like:

     For each element in the target language,

         a.  write transformation logic mapping source elements to 
target element
         b.  write (or generate) a &quot;rule&quot;, which is a little parser to 
examine the source text for elements needed to generate said target 
element; attach transformations from (a) to production in the grammar

In practice a target-driven strategy means writing a set of rules 
(functions) to be called in turn at each token in the source text.  I.e. 
Start with a target element and see if the corresponding source 
production(s) match(es); or, try to find the appropriate target element 
by testing various source productions.  Source language structure 
controls processing within the driver itself.

The source-driven approach embeds target generation code in a source 
grammar; the target-driven approach embeds source-grammar in target 
generation code.

I hope that is somewhere in the ballpark; it's nice and clean so it 
would be a shame if it was also stupid.  ;)   I think I understand how 
antlr works pretty well, but I'm not sure about the Jazillion approach.

If this schema is accurate/useful, then I would suggest building on the 
paper &quot;Why I don't Use...&quot; to produce a more general consideration of 
the pros and cons of the respective approaches.  Something like 
*&quot;Language Transformation Strategies: Source-Driven v. Target-Driven in 
a Fight to the Death!&quot;*  As it stands, the article is interesting 
(though a bit hard to follow for somebody like me, w/out lots of parsing 
experience), but it sometimes gives (me at least) the impression of 
saying &quot;my approach is better because, well, because I like it more&quot;. 
That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I gather that in large part 
that's because you find the one approach fits better with the way you 
think about the problem, which doesn't imply that it is a &quot;better&quot; 
approach.  I'd like to see a more dispassionate consideration of the 
pros and cons.  The &quot;mental model&quot; one needs for each strategy is 
obviously very important, but there are other considerations: 
efficiency, maintainability, etc. - the usual suspects.

And of course the overalln approach could be generalized, i.e. design an 
abstract uber-language (cf. IDL).  Then you can write one 
source-&gt;uberlang transformer per source lang, and one uberlang-&gt;target 
transformer per target language.  I suppose somebody already does this 
(or has decided it's impossible or impractical).

thanks,

gregg

<PRE>I presume you have broadband ...

Okay, I have unmetered net access, but it would not surprise me if for
some people on this list, net access consists of a 14.4 modem, running
at some horrendous per-minute fee over a phone line that is so crap that
even that thing can't run at full speed!

And don't forget - seeing that so many people pay to download (or have
limits on their broadband before they get cut off!) that enclosing 100K
of stuff that most people would consider rubbish actually means you have
WASTED HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS of OTHER PEOPLES' MONEY!

It's that last point you should really consider seriously ...

Cheers,
Wol

Selon &quot;John D. Mitchell&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">johnm-antlr at non.net</A>&gt;:

</I>mailing
&gt;<i> list!
</I>

I don't recommend rewriting asts unless you stay in same tree structure.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The &quot;manipulating an AST&quot; work of building a translator is quite a  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> different
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> job than the &quot;build a lexer/parser&quot; part of it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yep.  i'm mostly a fan of walking not rewriting ASts by the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way...that gets WAY too hard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I'm misunderstanding you, but walking vs. rewriting is like
</I>&gt;<i> apples vs. oranges (or &quot;the drive to and from work&quot; vs. &quot;going to
</I>&gt;<i> work all day&quot;). Walking is what you do when there's (almost) nothing
</I>&gt;<i> to do.
</I>
Except the entire work of the semantic analyzer of a compiler  
etc... ;)  Compute symb tables, flow analysis, well, just about  
everything right? ;)

&gt;<i> Further, Andy has a nice approach of rewriting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Expect ANTLRMorph, by Leon Su, this Fall!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To pick an AST manipulation rule at random...consider that when  
</I>&gt;<i> translating
</I>&gt;<i> C to Java, you can assign a zero value to any C struct. The C struct  
</I>&gt;<i> will become
</I>&gt;<i> a Java class, and the zero needs to change to &quot;null&quot;. Where in the AST
</I>&gt;<i> do we need to check? Here are a few ways to &quot;assign 0&quot; in C:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * simple assignment:   a = NULL;    (where we have #define NULL 0  
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere)
</I>&gt;<i> * function call arg:   f(0);        (where f's first arg is some  
</I>&gt;<i> struct type)
</I>&gt;<i> * ternary operator:    a = b ? 0 : 0; * function return:     a =  
</I>&gt;<i> f();     (where f() returns struct type)
</I>
You mean pointer to struct not struct right?

&gt;<i> So if we have a checkForZeroAssignment() method, calls to it will  
</I>&gt;<i> have to be inserted
</I>&gt;<i> in at least four distinct places in our Ctree.g file. And  
</I>&gt;<i> checkForZero() will
</I>&gt;<i> have to &quot;know&quot; where it's being called from anyway (for example, in  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> simple assignment case, it may have to search deep into nested curly  
</I>&gt;<i> braces
</I>&gt;<i> for array assignment).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So which way is best to slice the problem? We can have a
</I>&gt;<i> ZeroAssignmentRule class (along with a couple hundred others to do  
</I>&gt;<i> other things)
</I>&gt;<i> that searches the AST for these four cases. Or
</I>&gt;<i> we can have a Ctree.g that, at the ASSIGN node calls  
</I>&gt;<i> checkForZeroAssignment()
</I>&gt;<i> and a bunch (20? 50?) of other checks to do other things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be pretty impressed if ANTLRMorph makes this kind of work any  
</I>&gt;<i> easier,
</I>&gt;<i> as none of the other AST-rewrite systems seem to.
</I>
We don't do AST rewrite.  We go text-to-text.  You would list those  
rules above as you've specified.

assignment:
	&quot;x = NULL;&quot; -&gt; &quot;&lt;x&gt; = null&quot;

expr:
	&quot;f(0)&quot; -&gt; &quot;&lt;f&gt;(null)&quot;

the ternary could be handled a few ways...but it's worse, right?  You  
have a type conflict from int to ptr.  You have to decide what to do  
in that case in general.

ANTLRMorph rocks!

I wouldn't worry about that. There are already several dynamically

For parsing large files, I would worry more about memory. ANTLR lexer/
parsers are quite memory-hungry, and typically almost nothing can be gc'd
until the input is completely parsed and the CharStream and TokenStream
objects have been discarded.

(FWIW, I think most programmers systematically overestimate the performance
effect of running additional code, and underestimate the effect of memory
usage. The latter can absolutely kill performance if it leads to swapping.)

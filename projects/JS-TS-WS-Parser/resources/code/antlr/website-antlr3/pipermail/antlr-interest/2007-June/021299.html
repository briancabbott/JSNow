<PRE>Thanks to those who replied to my lexer problem about coping with
whitespace in the lexer described in Digest vol 31 issue 22 of 6 June.
As suggested parsing specifically for white space solved this problem.
 
However, I am still getting an ambiguity warning between ( __asm |
_asm | asm ) and ID. I don't want to accept this because it looks as
though something could be wrong (although it does in fact work).
 
I have tried the following options but they don't work (Cut down to
minimum for demonstration).
 
AsmStatements
 :
 (options{generateAmbigWarnings = false;}:
  (&quot;__asm&quot;|&quot;_asm&quot;|&quot;asm&quot;) //etc.
 )
 ;

AsmStatements
 options{generateAmbigWarnings = false;}
 :
  (&quot;__asm&quot;|&quot;_asm&quot;|&quot;asm&quot;) // etc.
 ;

Antlr accepts these statements but I still get lexical nondeterminsim
between rules AsmStatements and ID.
 
I can't find any similar example in the ANTLR2 documentation and I
would be grateful if someone could let me know what I doing wrong.
 
Thanks.
 
David Wigg

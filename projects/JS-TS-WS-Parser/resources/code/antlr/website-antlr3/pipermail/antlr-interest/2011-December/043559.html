Hi Bart and all ....

The main no viable alternative errors occur around line 25 of Smalltalk.g
in the rule:

method returns [Method n]
   
 :    o = NAME c= '_class_'? '&gt;&gt;'  messagePattern '[' primitive? 
temporaries? statements  ']' {$n = MethodFactory.create($o.text, 
$c.text, $messagePattern.n, $primitive.n, $temporaries.n, 
$statements.n);}
    ;

To get started with building and 
parsing you can either use Antrl works or the getting started here: 
<A HREF="http://www.redline.st/discover/getting-started.html">http://www.redline.st/discover/getting-started.html</A>
The project sources are here:  <A HREF="https://github.com/redline-smalltalk/redline-smalltalk">https://github.com/redline-smalltalk/redline-smalltalk</A>

In  a nutshell there are a few binarySymbol methods that cause this rule to break with a &quot;no viable&quot; alternative.

If you goto the file Magnitude.st and change line 14 from 

- \&gt; aMagnitude

to

- &gt; aMagnitude

You will then start to get the error.

If you were to make the line

- , aMagnitude

That will cause the error as well and it should not.

The second error I get is on the same rule. Essentially I changed the file PreProcessor.g to spit out a
'_class_' rather than 'class' to overcome a no viable alternative error I was getting. Id like to make sure
the preprocessor did NOT put out _class_ and that the method pattern rule on line 25 of Smalltalk.g
was ok with 'o = NAME c= 'class'? '&gt;&gt;'  messagePattern'

Not it is ok for a method to look like the following:

- class
  ^ nil

You could modify Magnitude.st to have a method like this for testing.

Rgs, James.

You are right Bart.

This list is always very quick to respond and very thorough with the responses.
I don't mean to be demanding.

No problem James.


Jim has helped me previously and has offered to help again, so I'll wait to see


how this turns out. Should I post again, Ill be sure to do as you suggest, and
include the rules and errors.

Yes, please do. 

Thanks All.

Rgs, James.

Regards,
Bart.

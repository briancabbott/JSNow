<PRE>Blah blah reply-to blah blah bloody blah...
 
Personally, I would rather see some discussions about ANTLR, grammar, parsing and so on than the same old BS about reply-to that I have seen in every list I have ever owned, joined or browsed ever ever ever.
 
How about:

*	
	To all intent and purpose, this is Terence's list;
*	
	He says he ain't changin' it;
*	
	Let's move on and top post, bottom post, interleave as you see fit;
*	
	If you want to keep going on about it, take it to alt.mail.headers.nonterminating.rule.boring.repeat.die.die.die;

&lt;breath&gt; ;-) ... just trying to somewhat lightly ask that we stop cluttering the list with this thing now. Please? Pretty please?
 
Now, when can I get my hands on ANTLR 3?  I have been sitting here for years using ANTLR, doing nothing for it, paying nothing for it and generally whinging about minor bugs and problems in the previous releases that I paid nothing for either. I am bored with that and it's about time I started moaning about getting ANTLR 3.
 
Actually, I did contribute some C++ generation bug fixes, but a fellow programmer submitted them and claimed the credit. Therefore I shall be suing the pants off Terrence (and everyone within 2 degrees of separation) immediately for the irreparable harm that he/they has/may have caused me by giving away [under certain license conditions] tools [without warranty] and code [and the odd comment on occasion] on the internet. That is if the company that I owned at the time does not sue Terrence, myself and my goldfish for contributing code to something that helped them to make a pile of cash.
 
Right, now, seriously, when CAN I have ANTLR 3? Amongst other things, I want to, sorry, have to, generate C for various reasons and it seems that this template thingy will do the trick. (I don't mind if it sends Terrence the telephone numbers of all my girlfirends and stats on how many times I press backspace.)

This just here to annoy the bottom posters or something.

<PRE>Antlr might be a good approach, but I think SAX or XML Pull
(<A HREF="http://www.xmlpull.org/">http://www.xmlpull.org/</A>) might be better solution. They have lower
overhead, and are specifically designed for handling large xml documents.
As for repetitions and parent relations, I would use Stack (or if you're
using xml pull, method calls) to keep track of where you are.

I am involved with a project of which one of the most
daunting components is to take a large XML document
and insert its contents in a relational database.  The
structure of the document allows for repetitions of
many of its elements, and may include the same types
of elements with different meanings based on context. 
I was trying to decide whether something like XSLT
might help with this problem, when I was struck by the
idea that a recursive-descent parser might be the
thing to use.  This way we could specify structure by
use of rules, and Antlr's use of parameters and return
values could allow us to specify a contextual
interpretation to an element, and receive a value by
which to associate it with a parent relational
database record.  Does this sound like a good
approach?  Can anyone offer a better alternative?

TIA,
Matt

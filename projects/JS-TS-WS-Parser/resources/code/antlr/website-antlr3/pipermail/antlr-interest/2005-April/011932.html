<PRE>Loring,

&gt;<i> &gt; Swing allows you to do exactly what you're saying, *but* gives the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; option of replacing the entire tree model yourself. This is 
</I>&gt;<i> TreeModel.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As usual, *I'm asking for an option* and getting shot down because 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; y'all don't happen to need it in the little boxes you're living in. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Think bigger!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wrong!  You've got your blinders on and are chasing windmills 
</I>&gt;<i> as a result. Complexity for complexity's sake is not good 
</I>&gt;<i> design.  The Carrier/Payload model provides all of the 
</I>&gt;<i> capability that you are campaigning for.
</I>
Not quite. Tree navigation classess must implement the Carrier interface.
Arbitary tree representations are therefore not supported. A TreeModel-style
abstraction would remove that restriction and, it would still wok perfectly
with the Carrier/Payload model.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Swing's JTree is mis-designed because the navigation class
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (JTree.DynamicUtilTreeNode) is referenced from the data 
</I>&gt;<i> container, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; not the other way around.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Huh? Which Swing are you talking about? What do you mean by 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;navigation referenced from the data container&quot;? It's not. The 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; navigation data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (TreeModel) is separate from the data, and is only called 
</I>&gt;<i> from the Jtree
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (the presentation). The real data doesn't call the tree model.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No.  The data container implements TreeNode; TreeModel just 
</I>&gt;<i> provides an access model which hides that ugly fact.
</I>
The data container doesn't *have* to implement TreeNode. You could have
separate TreeNode and Payload instances (the data container) and the
TreeModel abstraction would still work fine.

TreeModel isn't bound to (and doesn't know about) TreeNode.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; There are two navigation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; paradigms:  you can either use a Cursor object to 
</I>&gt;<i> navigate (in which 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; case, the options are assigning an object to the cursor, 
</I>&gt;<i> moving the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; cursor to one of the siblings or children of the assigned object, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; returning a sibling/child of the assigned object, or adding a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; child/sibling) or a Carrier.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You're thinking in a box and missing a better option. The ASTModel 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; option is a complete separation of cursor and navigation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Take the Jtree example.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jtree asks the TreeModel for the root node, and holds that 
</I>&gt;<i> root node. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is the &quot;current node&quot;, or cursor.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jtree renders the current node
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jtree asks the TreeModel to tell it the # of children, and asks for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; each in turn. As it asks for each, they are the cursor. It renders 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is a really flexible and less expensive solution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No--it is a solution that provides the required complexity 
</I>&gt;<i> for the problem that it solves.  At the lowest level, 
</I>&gt;<i> TreeNodes are quite analogous to ASTs and have all of the 
</I>&gt;<i> associated warts.  TreeNodes, however, tend to be persistent, 
</I>&gt;<i> while AST nodes have to be copied during each transformation 
</I>&gt;<i> pass.  ANTLR trees have different associated costs than Swing trees.
</I>
In the context of the discussion about introducing a tree abstraction into
ANTLR, this comments about TreeNode and Swing trees are strawmen. A
TreeModel-style abstraction has no dependence on TreeNodes or Swing trees,
it could use Carriers/Payloads (or indeed our old-style ASTs) directly if
that is all one cared about.

&gt;<i> &gt; The trouble is there are extra objects to collect. More objects == 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You miss the point.
</I>
Yes he does. A TreeModel-style abstraction isn't an alternative to the
Carrier/Payload model. It is a fa&#231;ade that allows one to use Carrier/Payload
or any other model one cares to implement.

&gt;<i> There is less manipulation of data 
</I>&gt;<i> pointers with Payloads implemented as objects distinct from 
</I>&gt;<i> Carriers when doing significant manipulations.  Objects 
</I>&gt;<i> created and destroyed are homogeneous, which places less 
</I>&gt;<i> stress on the garbage collector resulting in faster creation 
</I>&gt;<i> times and fewer compactions.  And, for platforms that do not 
</I>&gt;<i> have efficient garbage collectors, releasing Carriers back to 
</I>&gt;<i> a CarrierFactory is possible.
</I>
Indeed.

&gt;<i> &gt; is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *one* ASTModel.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ... and many ASTNodes, which makes it necessary to copy data 
</I>&gt;<i> fields during tree transformations, and that costs in terms 
</I>&gt;<i> of performance.
</I>
Not quite. An ASTNode abstraction might mix navigation and data or, it might
separate them as the Carrier/Payload model does. It isn't accurate to claim
that it is *neccesary* to copy data. That obviously depends on the [tree]
node abstraction in use and the use of a TreeModel-style abstraction doesn't
change that fact.

&gt;<i>  You cannot avoid costs associated with 
</I>&gt;<i> navigation; however, you can minimize the cost of maintaining 
</I>&gt;<i> AST data across transformation passes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For that matter, you can allow ASTs which implement both the 
</I>&gt;<i> Carrier and Payload interfaces for single pass language 
</I>&gt;<i> processors.  Don't confuse interfaces with classes--logical 
</I>&gt;<i> and physical structures can be quite different.
</I>
I could offer the same advise to you Loring  ;-)

A TreeModel-style tree abstraction can be implemented to use the
Carrier/Payload model. Other tree navigation/data models can be
implemented/supported just as easily.

Cheers,

Micheal

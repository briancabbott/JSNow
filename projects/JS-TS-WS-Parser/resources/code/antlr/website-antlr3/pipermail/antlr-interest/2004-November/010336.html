</I>
Let me try to firm up this discussion with a few points.  First of
all, tree walkers do pattern matching, but they do context-dependent
pattern matching rather than context-independent pattern matching. 
There are some problems for which context-independent pattern
transformation is the right approach; natural language processing is
not one of them.  There is the classic joke about early computerized
translation.  The Biblical line that &quot;The spirit is willing, but the
flesh is weak&quot; when translated from English to Russian and back came
back as &quot;The Vodka is good, but the meat is rotten&quot;.

You often have to be pretty smart when implementing
context-independent pattern matching.  Note all of the effort that
went into devising algorithms for finding substrings in
text--nowadays, that is commonly solved with the Boyer-Moore algorithm
and not by brute force.  For pattern matching in trees, the entire
tree is walked as a matter of course:  the only real savings a
context-independent pattern matcher has over a tree walker is in the
intellectual effort of figuring out the top-down tree structure.

That said, context-independent pattern matching and transformation can
be quite useful.  BURG is very useful for doing peephole optimization
in generating code.

&gt;<i> I found when doing my AREV translator that although I thought of my 
</I>&gt;<i> translations as being very specific -- translate AREV case statements 
</I>&gt;<i> into VB if-else statements, or translate dynamic array assignments into 
</I>&gt;<i> function calls -- I would simply implement them by overriding the few 
</I>&gt;<i> rules I needed to after subclassing from my tree grammar superclass. 
</I>&gt;<i> This let me do the usual tree grammar tricks like keeping track of the 
</I>&gt;<i> context.  In one case I had to distinguish between the root of an 
</I>&gt;<i> expression and sub-expressions -- this was easy in my tree grammar.
</I>
i. e:  Monty took as much advantage of context information as he could.

&gt;<i> This may have not been very efficient since I was walking and building 
</I>&gt;<i> trees for every other rule even though I didn't need to.  The building 
</I>&gt;<i> far outweighs the walking, and Loring has been addressing that issue 
</I>&gt;<i> with his new tree code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The dominant academic approach seems to be to let you define a &quot;rule 
</I>&gt;<i> soup&quot; and the engine figures out which rules must happen before which 
</I>&gt;<i> other rules.  This prolog-type approach leads to very hard to debug 
</I>&gt;<i> translators.
</I>
That is: to determine which transformations should not be appled in a
given context.  The rule-based systems tend to be
computation-intensive since they work by applying transformations in
sequence, then repeating until there are no phrases left which could
be transformed (I'm ignoring some optimization here--this is the
purely brute-force version).

&gt;<i> I agree that pattern-matching with ANTLR grammars is not fun, because 
</I>&gt;<i> you do the actual testing in actions or semantic predicates.  However, 
</I>&gt;<i> this is actually implemented as a tree walker in the BaseAST or 
</I>&gt;<i> CommonAST findAll and findAllPartial methods.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the future ANTLR could have better support of pattern matching of 
</I>&gt;<i> trees.  I can't remember any specifics right now, but I'd be surprised 
</I>&gt;<i> if Loring hasn't already addressed it with the 2.8/3.0 tree stuff.
</I>
No, I haven't added anything special for pattern matching.  The
automated tree grammar generation lessens the need--it provides the
interactive feedback needed to deal with tree transformation as a
design problem, not just to construct trees that can be walked via a
tree grammar.  That makes ANTLR's context-dependent pattern matching
more powerful, and the context-independent findAll routines
essentially irrelevant.

--Loring

&gt;<i> The thing is, once I've matched a pattern I usually want to do a 
</I>&gt;<i> transformation on it.  A natural way to do that is with templates --
</I>one 
&gt;<i> to match, the other to transform.  Please see 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.erights.org/elang/quasi/overview.html">http://www.erights.org/elang/quasi/overview.html</A> for some examples (I 
</I>&gt;<i> helped flesh out some implementation details of those but it's really 
</I>&gt;<i> the work of Mark Miller).  The pattern can be written as source
</I>language 
&gt;<i> code with special markers for generic expressions or whatnot.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> translation patter could be written in code as well and translated into 
</I>&gt;<i> a tree (assuming a parser exists) with appropriate parts copied from
</I>the 
&gt;<i> original tree to the new tree.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The main point is that I still want to specify the order of my 
</I>&gt;<i> translations.  There are some directions ANTLR could go toward making 
</I>&gt;<i> the specification of translations easier, namely pattern matching and 
</I>&gt;<i> substitution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wish I had more time to flesh this out, maybe tomorrow.

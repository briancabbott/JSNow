<PRE>I've been having a hard time distinguishing what should be part of the runtime and what it solely part of the language.
Because that is all that I've been taught, I've been working on what the language should look and feel like.  I haven't had to think about the runtime.   I'll sleep easier once I can draw a line and start separating the two.

Thank you,


Waverly

there ought to be some literature out there. However, when I studied it
(which I remember barely) it was all about the runtime and VMing, rather
than compilation

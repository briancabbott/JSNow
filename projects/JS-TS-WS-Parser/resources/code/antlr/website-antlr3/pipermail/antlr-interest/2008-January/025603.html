</I>The NLP field has it's own set of tools and a completely different 
approach to parsing than the programming-language-parsing field. Unless 
you have complete control of the input and you can make it a relatively 
trivial grammar, ANTLR and similar tools are the wrong tools to use. By 
&quot;trivial&quot; here, I mean a couple thousand lines. I think you'll never get 
ANTLR (or similar) to parse real-world natural language in any 
meaningful way - that is, create a real AST with NOUN and VERB and 
PREPOSITIONAL_CLAUSE and so on.

I once saw a poster for a NLP conference, and I noticed that among the 
images on the poster was a newspaper with the headline &quot;Woods Eyes 
Masters&quot;. Try parsing that sentence without knowing the context - that 
it's a sports headline :) After chewing on that for a while, you'll see 
why the best NLP programs are really based on statistical analysis of 
word frequencies, rather than top-down &quot;parsing&quot;.

<PRE>My $0.02:

I don't think translating a general yacc /program/ is practical - a
/grammar/, perhaps, but that means no actions anywhere.  That's
interesting in theory, but not really of that much practical value.

The other side of this is that you want the people maintaining the
code to know ANTLR at the end, as well - therefore, it may be of more
benefit to have them learn ANTLR, and then translate (by hand) the
yacc /programs/.

Having the people learn the idioms for yacc's &quot;left recursion&quot; and
&quot;right recursion&quot;, as well as how precedence is handled in Antlr, will
go many miles towards having a maintainable product when you are
finished - instead of a generated pile of code that no one
understands.

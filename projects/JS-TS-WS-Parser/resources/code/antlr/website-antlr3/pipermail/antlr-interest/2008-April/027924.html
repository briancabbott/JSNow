<PRE>Gavin,

Thanks for your clear explanation!

&gt;<i> Think of what decisions ANTLR has to make (assuming you've made it 
</I>&gt;<i> optional), and you'll see why it thinks it's ambiguous.
</I>[...]
&gt;<i> But how is it to know whether the 
</I>&gt;<i> Identifier it just saw is a statement or a 
</I>&gt;<i> returnStatement?  Answer: it can't.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I did realise there was no way for ANTLR to determine whether an
Identifier was part of a (normal) statement or part of a return
statement, your explanation confirms my line of thought. 
I never meant to question the validity of the warning that was given.

&gt;<i> Now, you've said that you want the &quot;return&quot; keyword to be 
</I>&gt;<i> optional.  One way you could do that would be to permit an 
</I>&gt;<i> expression as a valid statement:
</I>&gt;<i>    statementBody:	statementList returnStatement? EOF;
</I>&gt;<i>    returnStatement: 'return' expression;
</I>&gt;<i>    statementList:	(statement ';'*)*;
</I>&gt;<i>    statement:	expression;
</I>&gt;<i>    expression:	addressable( '*' addressable)*;
</I>&gt;<i>    addressable:	Identifier ( '.' Identifier '()' )*;
</I>&gt;<i>    Identifier:	('a'..'z')+;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are two downsides to this, of course; the first is that 
</I>&gt;<i> you've widened the possible inputs (which may not be acceptable), 
</I>&gt;<i> and the second is that it isn't very easy to pick off the final 
</I>&gt;<i> expression statement to give it special handling, if you want to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Unfortunately, both downsides you mention are indeed going to cause
grief...the actual grammar in question is much bigger and we have a
rather big installed base.
 
&gt;<i> Another thing you could do is to remove 'addressable' from the 
</I>&gt;<i> list of possible statements.  So long as anything that can match 
</I>&gt;<i> 'expression' cannot also match 'statement', the ambiguity is gone.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>This would also break all our existing code, so unfortunately that one
is out too!

&gt;<i> Yet another thing is to re-examine the parentheses in 
</I>&gt;<i> 'addressable'.  Is 'Identifier' really supposed to be an 
</I>&gt;<i> addressable by itself?  Should the parentheses be outside the loop 
</I>&gt;<i> instead (so that 'foo' isn't an addressable, but 'foo()' is)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>You really looked at the grammar in depth! I agree that it looks silly,
but the point of the 'addressable' is that you can start with a variable
or argument, and use methods and attributes of this variable or argument
to chain them together (e.g.
myarg.SomeGetMethod().AnotherMethod().GetAttribute()) so yes, an
Identifier by itself is a valid addressable.

&gt;<i> If you can't change the input language in this way, then you'll 
</I>&gt;<i> have to resolve the ambiguity with sempreds.  The main one (since 
</I>&gt;<i> it's in a loop) is the 'addressable' in 'statement' -- you have to 
</I>&gt;<i> add a sempred telling it to fail any addressables that should be 
</I>&gt;<i> interpreted as return statements instead.  Presumably they're 
</I>&gt;<i> distinct enough that you can tell the difference.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Unfortunately they are not distinct at all, the only distinction is
that the last statement in the method must be an expression, optionally
preceded by the 'return' keyword.

&gt;<i> (If you can't tell the difference, then you probably shouldn't be
</I>trying to 
&gt;<i> remove that keyword.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Point taken, I guess I just didn't realise that this relatively small
change to the language actually makes it very hard to parse.

&gt;<i> Beyond these suggestions, I'm not really sure.  I've usually been 
</I>&gt;<i> working with DSLs that I'm in full control of, so I've tended to 
</I>&gt;<i> designed languages that are easy to parse :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Good point! This whole exercise would wreak havoc on a very workable
grammar for a (reasonably) well-defined language.

It may seem as though I've blown off all your suggestions, but you've
actually helped me a lot: I now feel comfortable saying that making the
'return' keyword optional requires some significant changes to the
grammar and (therefore) to our language, which is not at all what I had
in mind when I set out to make the 'return' keyword optional.

Thanks again for your useful input.

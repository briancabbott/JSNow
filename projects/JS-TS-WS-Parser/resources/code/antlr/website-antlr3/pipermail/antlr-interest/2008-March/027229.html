<PRE>Andy--

As others have pointed out, take a look at
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1760">http://www.antlr.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1760</A>
and also:
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/article/parse.trees/index.tml">http://www.antlr.org/article/parse.trees/index.tml</A>

Visitors (&quot;just have some (&quot;by hand&quot;) code that walks the AST&quot;) have their place.  Not all language translation passes need heavy-duty language processing machinery.  Some do, though, and most benefit.  Pretty printing is one of those that benefits:  take a look at jalopy (<A HREF="http://jalopy.sourceforge.net/">http://jalopy.sourceforge.net/</A>) to see what ANTLR can do with Java.

Yea, I'm sure that would become a huge mess very quickly.

But suppose you design things so that the parser just parses (producing an AST) and does not
try to do any translation. And similarly, suppose you don't try to define
a treewalker to do translation, because that's going to have this
&quot;huge amounts of code buried within a grammar&quot; problem anyway.

Instead, you just have some (&quot;by hand&quot;) code that walks the AST.
Wouldn't that code be straightforward, simply ignoring any nodes that it
doesn't need to process? For example, look at my thing that just
walks a Java AST &quot;by hand&quot; and pretty prints it:
<A HREF="http://www.jazillian.com/articles/JavaEmitter.java">http://www.jazillian.com/articles/JavaEmitter.java</A>
Seems like this wouldn't be much more complicated to deal with a parse tree
than it is now dealing with an AST.

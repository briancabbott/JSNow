<PRE>Thanks for the replies, guys... I think I wasn't clear enough when I
described the situation, though. Certainly, you want to track where
individual tokens came from, which ANTLR does for you well as long as you
set the name for each of your char streams. And, that works great. My
question is, what is a good way to handle the situation where tokens *within
the same node* come from different char streams?

Here's a more concrete example. Say you run into this line in your C-like
language:

if (VALUE + a &gt; 0) { echo &quot;hi&quot;; }

where 'VALUE' is a macro that's defined in an include file. Your lexer
substituted VALUE with the defined value (say '1.0'), and marked the char
stream appropriately. Now, your tree walker comes upon 1.0+a, and say your
language doesn't allow additional of reals and integers, so you want to
mark/underline the expression &quot;VALUE + a&quot; and say &quot;No adding of reals and
integers&quot;.

So, your tree node looks like this: (+ 1.0 a). If you ask ANTLR to give you
the starting token for this tree node, it will correctly give you the &quot;1.0&quot;
token. If you look inside it, you'll find that it came from an include file,
at starting character 10, for example. Then you get the end token, which is
'a', and it came from 'main.c' ending at character 540.

Now what, how do you underline 'VALUE + a'? I.e. how do you figure out the
starting and ending character of your expression in 'main.c'? The user
doesn't want to see the VALUE definition in another file underlined as
there's nothing wrong with the line of code.

A similar problem occurs if you have a list of statements, and the first (or
last) few came from an include file.. if you wanted to show the proper range
in the original file, you can't determine the location of the 'include'
statement by only examining your &quot;list of statements&quot; tree node and the
tokens in it.

I hope what I'm describing makes sense.

Thanks,
Stan

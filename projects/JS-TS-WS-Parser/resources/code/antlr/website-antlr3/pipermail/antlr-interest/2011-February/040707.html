<PRE>Jim,

Thanks for the suggestion - although I don't quite want the level of detail
you guys go into (and I don't quite understand all of it, possibly because I
don't know the JavaFX syntax!) the source code was very useful and I think
I've now got enough to put in some decent error messages.

There are two things I'm still having trouble with that I think are related
to this question strongly enough to not warrant a new thread. The first is
printing out the line that the error occurred on. I wanted to try out
mimicking the sort of print out that javac does when it encounters an error,
but I can't work out how to get access to the text of the line that is
having the problem. I read here -
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1769">http://www.antlr.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1769</A> - that if you
are using the CommonTokenStream you should have access to a &quot;token&quot; with the
information, but in my getErrorMessage override that simply returns null for
most of the errors I've tried (currently MisMatchedToken exceptions):

public String getErrorMessage(RecognitionException e, String[] tokenNames) {
    // Prints out true!
    System.out.println(e.token == null);
}

I then read that you can use the inputstream attached to the
RecognitionException instead (can't quite remember where... the official
docs?), but can't figure out how to do this. Currently I have tried casting
it from an IntStream to a CharStream (I think it will always be a CharStream
for me... maybe XD) and played with the various methods available, but none
of them seem to offer a way to just print out the current line. The most
promising looks like substring(start, stop), but I cannot find a way to get
the length of the line to give as the &quot;stop&quot; parameter! I also assume that
if I do this method I should mark the stream before I begin, and rewind it
once I'm done?

Alternatively, if there's a &quot;better&quot; way to do this when overriding the
getErrorMessage method please tell me.

The second problem I'm having is with is stopping the parser from running if
the lexer has spat out any errors. As far as I can tell, it's very possible
and easy to stop the lexer after a single error message is thrown, but I
cannot find anywhere that shows how to let the lexer continue but not let
the parser run. Since all error messages are only thrown once you call
something like &quot;program_return parserResult = parser.program();&quot; (i.e. the
lexer has no errors until after this line), then I can't stop it parsing the
syntactically invalid file and spitting out more (useless, imo) error
messages! Is there a 'correct' or even just any way to achieve this?

Thanks,
Stephen

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Subject: [antlr-interest] Correct way to handle custom errors?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was wondering what the &quot;correct&quot; way to handle custom errors in ANTLR
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3 was. I'm implementing a parser/lexer for a small subset of C, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want to give better error messages than the general mismatched tokens
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; error.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  From this post -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Error+reporting+and+recovery">http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Error+reporting+and+recovery</A> I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implemented my own error reporting class which grabs the recognition
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exception from the Parser. However, I'm then unsure about the best
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; approach is to start recognising errors - from things as basic as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; replacing the name of my variable name rule (ID) with a more user-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; friendly term such as &quot;identifier&quot;, to more complex things such as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; giving nice error messages when the user attempts to set a variable to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a value that isn't an integer or character (the only two allowable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; types in my subset). The recognition exception doesn't seem to be too
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; useful - getMessage() seems to return null.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I assume that the getErrorHeader and getErrorMessage methods do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something different to get information. The only way I can think of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; checking for errors at the moment is manually scraping the strings
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; returned by these methods, which seems... clumsy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, is there a sort of &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;usual&quot; method to approaching
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parser/lexer error message handling when doing programming language
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parsing?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I hope the above contained enough information, and made sense.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Stephen

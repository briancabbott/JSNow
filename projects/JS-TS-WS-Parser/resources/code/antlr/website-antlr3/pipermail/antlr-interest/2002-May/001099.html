Hmm...seems like maybe your grammar, (T1|T2|T3), would have an action 
after that switched the lexer to see the T4 lexer...Hmm...is it a 
sequence of T1..T3?  If so that is harder...you will need a trigger in 
your lexer or parser somehow to know when to switch.  Typically the 
language is the problem when you can't figure out what the &quot;trigger&quot; 
is.  I.e., your language is highly context sensitive or something.

&gt;<i> So here is my question, is this a limitation of Parser Generators?
</I>&gt;<i> or is this specific to antlr. Am I better off using another Parser
</I>&gt;<i> Generator like JavaCC?
</I>
As I say, you might take a look at the language spec.  Is this something 
that you folks wrote?  Can you change it?

&gt;<i> Before somebody flames at my post, please note that I'm just
</I>&gt;<i> learning
</I>&gt;<i> about Parser Generators and I donot have a CS degree.
</I>
No flame wars here. :)  We are a cuddly sort of mailing list :) ;)

<PRE>Hello,

We at EclipseFP (<A HREF="http://eclipsefp.sourceforge.net">http://eclipsefp.sourceforge.net</A>) are developing an
Eclipse-based IDE for the Haskell language and we are using Antlr on
our parser/lexer code. There is of course the need to access the Antlr
library at runtime and the standard way to do this in Eclipse is
having a plugin that contains it. We managed to do that so far by
packaging the antlr inside one of our plugins but we see that this
isn't the best approach, since we don't really maintain the antlr
code. So, we are looking for a plugin (preferarbly with an easy to use
installation process, like an update site) that solely contains it.

I happened to find the antlreclipse plugin at

<A HREF="http://antlreclipse.sourceforge.net/">http://antlreclipse.sourceforge.net/</A>

But the standard setup downloads and installs a collection of plugins
for editing Antlr code. Most of our users won't need all those
plugins, but only the main antlr library for running the haskell
parser code. Is there a way to download only a plugin with the library
code, without the Antlr editor and other plugins?  I see that the
project release page includes a library only package, but it seems
outdated. Is there any other antlr eclipse plugin (one that is not
easily found with a simple web search)?

Am I looking at the wrong place? If so, could anyone point me to the
right direction?

I am willing to provide such a package (maybe for download at the
antlr download page, or helping the antlreclipse folks) if there is
interest.

Cheers,

Thiago Arrais
</PRE>

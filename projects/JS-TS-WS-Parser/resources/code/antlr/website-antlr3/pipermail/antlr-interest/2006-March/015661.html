<PRE>Hello!

ANTLRWorks 1.0ea8 is now available:

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/works/index.html">http://www.antlr.org/works/index.html</A>

This version fixes and improves several things. I would like to  
emphasis some new features:
- rule dependency graph
- display unreachable alternative in syntax diagram
- contextual menus in editor, syntax diagram, interpreter and debugger
- all visual graph can be exported to ps
- can now specify which tokens are to be ignored in the interpreter

The ANTLRWorks jar has everything you need including the latest  
version of ANTLR 3.0ea8 and StringTemplate 2.3b6.

Enjoy!

Jean


*** History ***

Version 1.0ea8 - 03/11/06

- new: rule dependency graph (can be exported to EPS or bitmap file)
- new: syntax coloring for generated Java code
- new: references, comments and strings are now colorized inside actions
- new: contextual menus in editor, syntax diagram, interpreter and  
debugger
- new: user can now specify tokens to be ignored in interpreter
- new: syntax colors can be changed in the preferences
- new: display of unreachable alternatives in the syntax diagram

- parse tree (interpreter/debugger) can now be scrolled by clicking  
and dragging the mouse
- new idea to convert invalid string literals to single quote literals
- new message in status bar if an error is reported in the console
- ctrl-k: now copy the deleted end of line to the system clipboard
- ctrl-t: now swap two characters (insert templates is now invoked  
using meta-k)
- click in the debug parse tree will show corresponding token in  
input stream and position in grammar
- kill the remote parser if the debugger cannot stop it (not  
applicable to remote parser)
- update the rules status and syntax diagram each time the grammar is  
analyzed (not only when using the Check Grammar command)
- improved ANTLR usage by running ANTLR only when necessary
- rules are now sorted in interpreter and debugger if they are sorted  
in the editor
- disabling syntax diagram now display a message
- now reload the tokenVocab file content when ANTLRWorks is back to  
front
- improved selection of a identifier
- improved word selection using the mouse: dragging the mouse without  
releasing the button
   now extends the selection word by word (as expected on Mac OS X)
- improved decision DFA diagram using more precise B-splines
- added an arrow at the end of each syntax diagram
- check grammar command now also analyzes the lexer part of a  
combined grammar
- improved current select path in syntax diagram when switching path  
visiblity
- improved syntax diagram display (colored label and smaller size)

- fixed a bug where auto-indentation would be applied for a ':' even  
inside an action block
- fixed a bug where some tokens were not properly colorized (cut and  
past the same token over itself)
- fixed a bug where the file content was not properly parsed if  
modified outside ANTLRWorks
- fixed a bug where the analysis indicator was colored improperly
- fixed a bug where Go To Character would be off by one character
- fixed a bug when reading the tokenVocab file (was missing the first  
character)
- fixed a bug where ANTLR would not be able to read the tokenVocab  
file (missing path)
- fixed a bug in the code generation (problem with grammar name)
- fixed a bug in the syntax diagram engine where a link from a rule  
to another rule would start at the wrong state
- fixed a bug in the syntax diagram path drawing where some paths  
were not correctly rendered

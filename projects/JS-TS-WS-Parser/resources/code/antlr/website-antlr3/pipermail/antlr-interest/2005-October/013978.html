<PRE>I must apologize that I've been unable to help resolve the antlr-eclipse
plugin conflict. Been insanely busy at work for the past month for a huge
client demo. As soon as I get a chance to breathe, I'll give it a poke.
 
I think uninstalling antlr-eclipse is a good solution for now; ANTLR Studio
really does the same (and more) anyway, so you really don't need them both.
At least I hope not!
 
Later,

Subject: [antlr-interest] ANTLR Studio release information


As antlrstudio.com is currently down cause my host is having some problems
(will be back by tomorrow morning), I cant access my blog. So I am posting
this here.

This is for all the people who want to know the details of ANTLR Studio's
release.

The beta will expire tomorrow. I had originally planned to release on 19th
itself. But it seems it will take a few more days. It should be done by end
of this week though.
There will be a fully functional 15 day evaluation available of Antlr Studio
on release. 
The cost of full version will be 49$. 

Antlr Studio will be available at www.placidsystems.com (not available right
now). On release antlrstudio.com will be redirected to placidsystems.com .
You will need to completly remove the beta of ANTLR Studio to install the
final release, as the package names differ.

I have been unable to solve the conflict with the ANTLR Eclipse plugin, so
you will need to uninstall that too.

If you want to be automatically informed of the release of ANTLR Studio,
please send me an email with the subject 'Inform Me'.
If you found some bugs while evaluting ANTLR Studio, you can still tell me
and they will be cured before release.

For those who dont already know ANTLR Studio is an IDE for ANTLR that plugs
into the Eclipse IDE. 
You can watch the videos of it at antlrstudio.com  .
Note that as of writing this, antlrstudio.com is down but will be back in
around 12-14 hrs.

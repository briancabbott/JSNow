<PRE>Well, the first question is why are you cheating around this?  Because
you're not parsing header files or something?

There is a method boolean isTypedefName(String name) which you could tweak
to act the way you want.  

I think that parenthesis are used for grouping, so you can't assume that A
(B) is a function call, but I'd have to dig into the spec to really know.

Subject: [antlr-interest] cgram: typedef name vs function name questions

I am interested in parsing C code is a consistent manner but the
output does not need to be suitable for a compiler. How can I cheat my
way around the following difficulty?

The following one line C file causes an error message in cgram (and
also gcc):

    xxx obj;

Correct parsing sometimes depends on knowing whether &quot;xxx&quot; is a
typedef name or a function name. Harbison &amp; Steele say

    ... consider the program line

         A ( *B ) ;

    If &quot;A&quot; has been defined as a typedef name, then the line is a
    declaration of a variable &quot;B&quot; of type &quot;pointer to A&quot;. (The
    parentheses surrounding &quot;*B&quot; are ignored.) If &quot;A&quot; is not a
    type name, then the line is a call of the function &quot;A&quot; with the
    single parameter &quot;*B&quot;. This ambiguity cannot be resolved
grammatically.

This determination is somehow carried out in the &quot;initDecl&quot; rule in
&quot;GnuCParser.g&quot;. How is this done? Is &quot;xxx obj;&quot; unambiguous because
there are no parentheses? If &quot;B&quot; has already been declared or there in
no &quot;*&quot;, must &quot;A&quot; be a function name? I would like the grammar to
assume &quot;xxx&quot; is a typedef name unless it can deduce otherwise. How can
this be done?

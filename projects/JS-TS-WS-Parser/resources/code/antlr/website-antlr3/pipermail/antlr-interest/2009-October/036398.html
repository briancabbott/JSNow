<PRE>Hello Peter,

i myself am not too familiar with ANTLR 3 (and parser generators in general)
and for that reason i feel tempted to try to give some answers.

A symbol is a 'word' in a grammar, like a word in a natural language. A
symbol can be a terminal (symbol) which can no further be 'reduced', like
reserved words in a programming language: 'for', 'while', 'if'... You get
the picture. Non-terminals are the left side of a grammar (production) rule.
Non-terminals are reduced during parsing according to the defined grammar
and the stream of available tokens.

A lexer usually takes a character stream as an input and converts it in a
stream of tokens. The characters 'f', 'o', 'r', ' ', '(' for example become
the tokens 'for' and '('. In the old times (and still today with certain
lexers) lexer rules were defined just by regular expressions, which
restricts the class of what can be recognized by a parser pretty much
compared to ANTLR.

The parser takes a token stream as a input and tries to recognize a higher
level order. Think of it as sentences of a language following a certain
grammar. The rules which make up a parser grammar are usually much more
complex than lexer rules. (E)BNF can not be expressed by regular expression.

LL(k), LL(*) parsers (top-down, results are build by working their way from
left to right) are classes of parsers which are not very popular. I might be
wrong (or to old) but LR parsers are much more common. So maybe have a quick
look at lex/yacc. For me that's the father of all parser generators (for C).

Predicates (syntactic and semantic) help a LL parser determine which 'way to
go' or which alternatives to ignore. I guess they are quite unique to LL
parsers which have the &quot;problem&quot; with left-recursion or common prefix, which
really is no problem once you got your head around it.

For what it's worth: i would not start with ANTLR to build my first
grammars. The documentation is far too sophisticated for my taste and you
definitivly have to have some experiences to get started. If you don't know
what to look for even the book is useless. Don't get me wrong ANTLR 3 is a
very powerful and reliable tool, but before you use it make sure you really
need it. If you'd like to stick to ANTLR, have a look at the example
grammars. There are lots of 'em around and they give good hints on how to
solve promlems. 

And last but not least, if you are really interested in things, read the
Dragon Book: Principles of Compiler Design, by Alfred Aho and Jeffrey D.
Ullman

Regards,

Horst

PS: For those recognizing my errors and misunderstandings, help Peter to get
going.

</I>&gt;<i> (I tried reading the Wikipedia article, but that waffles on without

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the example for &quot;How to build a grammar from a language

</I>&gt;<i> Does that make it a non-terminal symbol?
</I>&gt;<i> Is this example grammar handled by a lexer or a parser or both?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do have some other questions, but they're not directly related to
</I>&gt;<i> the wiki page, so I'll leave them for a later email, once I have a

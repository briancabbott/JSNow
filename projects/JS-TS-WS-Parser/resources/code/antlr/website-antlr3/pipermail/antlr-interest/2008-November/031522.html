If it is not parsing valid input, then it would indeed be a bug, but
unfortunately, you probably think it is valid input but it isn't for one
reason or another.

I have never known a backtracking parser to fail to parse something that
will match one rule or another (valid input that the grammar is proven
to accept [the grammar, not the generated code ;-)] .) This is almost
certainly an error in the grammar, which is masked by the inability
localize the error (see below). Could be a bug of course, but my first
instinct is that it is not.

Basically, backtracking turns off any ambiguity errors that would
otherwise be thrown up at analysis time (and even if you are using
backtracking, it is worth turning that option off and generating the
code, to see what the ambiguities are). However, it isn't quite as
simple as just taking each alt in order as if the analysis shows that
some alts do not need predicates then predicates won't be inserted in
the hope of optimizing the parse.

So, if you can isolate some standalone grammar rule with a smallish
input, that shows that changing the rule order breaks the grammar, then
it would be considered a bug, all other things being equal (such as you
are using your own semantic predicates that work off flags being set or
not and changing the rule order somehow causes the flags to be
different).


&gt;<i> Left factoring is not a great option for me as I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to tear apart what belongs together 
</I>
Unfortunately, what you think belongs together with your language
reading brain is quite often not the same as a good grammar ;-) You can
usually left factor without altering the maintainability at all though.
In fact I would argue that what you are seeing here shows that
backtracking parsers are more difficult to maintain because sometimes
the only way to find out what is happening is to debug with ANTLRWorks.

Other than performance, I think that the main issue with backtracking is
error recovery/syntax errors. This is because given some rule:

r : ra | rb | rc;

Backtracking will try alt ra, and if that fails try rb, then rc. If we
suppose that ra, rb and rc are complicated rules, then apart from the
very long syntactic predicates involved, a syntax error way down the
path of say rc, will cause the error to occur at start(r). Suppose you
have:

ra: attributes modifiers function;
rb: attributes modifiers function_prototype;
rc: attributes modifiers class;

and your input (supposedly trying to match rc, is:

&lt;Attribute&gt; &lt;Attribute&gt; public final static class F(int A) {
//lots of class body
syntax error here
}

Your backtracking will try ra and fail because it sees class, it will
try rb and fail because it sees class then try rc, get all the way to
the syntax error, then fail the predicate at the syntax error, so it
won't take rc either. It will then throw a recognition exception at the
first &lt;Attribute&gt; because none of the paths match, and your parser users
will be very confused.

Note that the order should not matter, so again, it would be a bug if
you can show that correct input is not matched when you reorder the
alts, assuming no side effects of your alts.

I would be betting on a situation like this if I were you. What you are
seeing as valid input is valid at that point, but a syntax error farther
along in the stream is throwing the error a lot earlier than you think,
even though it is also done a heck of a lot more work than you think.

The only way to work out what is going wrong is to generate your parser
with the -debug option, run your program, then attach to the parser
remotely using ANTLR Works. This will step you through the parse and you
will get to some point where a recognition error happens in the
predicate, that you were not expecting, and explains why it doesn't take
the path you think it should.

I can't think off-hand of any grammar that would not be easier to look
after in a refactored state. For instance, from the above:

r : attributes modifiers
      (
          function_types
        | class
      )
   ;

function_types
   : function_decl_spec
       (
           SEMI     // Prototype
         | function_body
       )
    ;
function_decl_spec
You can play around with where things are parsed of course, but your
tree then just reflects the real structure of the program instead of
trying to jump straight to FUNCTION or FUNCTION_DECL and so on.


m : x+=r* -&gt; ^(MEMBERS $x*)
  ;

r : a=attributes m=modifiers
      (
          f=function_types

             -&gt; ^(MEMBER $a? $m? $f)

        | c=class

             -&gt; ^(MEMBER $a? $m? $c)

      )
   ;

function_types
   : f=function_decl_spec
       (
           SEMI     // Prototype

	     -&gt; ^(FUNC_DECL $f)
	
         | fb=function_body

	     -&gt; ^(FUNCTION $fb)
       )
    ;


&gt;<i> and predicates cannot be 
</I>&gt;<i> applied as I'm working with another framework (openarchitectureware's 
</I>&gt;<i> xText) that generates an Antlr grammar without giving me the possibility 
</I>&gt;<i> to intervene and define those.
</I>
Perhaps you should use a different tool, or can fix the tool, or get teh
authors to fix the tool?

The problem is that the framework is generating a poor grammar and it
should machine re-factor before generating the grammar. This is fairly
easy if it already 'knows' the problem domain (and not so easy if you
have a generic tool like ANTLR itself). By which I mean that if it is
going to generate a bunch of rules from a template, then the template
should be refactored to avoid the problem. Or knowing in advance the
types of inputs that cause it to generate ambiguous parsers, then it
should special case them. It need not necessarily conduct complete
analysis, and if it were to do that, then it might as well generate the
code and skip the grammar ;-)

More simply though, the framework is probably generating an incorrect
grammar, or the input that causes it to generate the grammar that it
does is incorrect, or your input is not actually correct even thoguh it
looks like it is.

Generally, just don't use backtracking, but there are some situations
where it might be useful:

1) The input is guaranteed to be syntactically correct because it is
generated by some program, that would be considered in error itself it
generated syntactically incorrect code. For instance a symbolic
representation of an intermediate step in a compiler (say assembler code
generation);
2) Performance and error localization are not an issue because the input
is either correct or it isn't. For instance a code formatter can just
abandon a format and say &quot;Your code is not correct, fix it and try
again&quot;.
3) At a push, prototyping. Though my own feeling here is that you end up
with a weaker parser than you would and never get around to making the
production version.
4) One shot parsers, written to convert one thing in to another then
thrown away (though they may be covered by 1 and 2 above really).

If you can show a small grammar and an input set that does not parser
correctly, then you will surely get Ter to fix it. So far thoguh, there
is no indication of an error in ANTLR (that does not mean there isn't
one, but that there is not enough information yet.)

Hope this helps somewhat,

Jim

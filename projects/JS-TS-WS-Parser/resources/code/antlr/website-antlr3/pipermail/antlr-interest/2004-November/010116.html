OK, I got a 5-7x speedup just by buffering the whole input (tested
with C# not C++). In your tests, were you reading from a file or
memory buffer?

&gt;<i> Do not worry. We will make profiling also and will try fix some

&gt;<i> Of course we will inform this list about results.
</I>
That would be very useful.

&gt;<i> &gt; I can't but, I can at least ask that you take of one the simple

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manually to implement the features you feel strongly about.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We can then test both versions. The results can then properly inform

</I>&gt;<i> Problem is that I do not have a lots of wish to study internals of

</I>
You won't be studying ANTLR internals. You would be studying the ANTLR
generated code for a small sample - which you already do for your much
larger project - and augmenting it with changes that you believe would
make it run faster.

&gt;<i> Exists major developers of ANTLR. I give an advice.
</I>&gt;<i> It is business of these developers listen or not.
</I>&gt;<i> It is business of these developers TRY and PROVE that std::string is
</I>best of
&gt;<i> the best by speed.
</I>
True but, ANTLR is an open source project whose developers are drawn
from it's pool of users. If you - as a user - can contribute to make
it go faster, why not do it?. It's to your benefit [too] right?

&gt;<i> But if they will find that special class can give us AT LEAST 10% of
</I>speed
&gt;<i> up, then I vote for new class. I hope my logic is clear ?   :-)
</I>
Crystal.

&gt;<i> Just I want underline. Many times was told:
</I>&gt;<i>     parsing is so fast task comparing to MAJOR DBMS tasks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Now we have the first benches which show that our DBMS
</I>&gt;<i>     can do work 10-15 times faster that parser itself.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     This means that _such_ parser become huge overhead for us.
</I>&gt;<i>     this is not pleasant of course.
</I>
Too big an overhead in anyone's estimation I'd presume. But the change
to [F]Lex lexing should reduce that considerably. Add a large-ish
in-memory buffer and you should be much happier.

&gt;<i> I like ANTLR. We have spend 18 months with it.
</I>&gt;<i> So I'd prefer get faster ANLTR that to be forced for new parser.
</I>
ANTLR is getting faster. It can get there even quicker with more
people/resources.

</I>I remember that discussion from the publisher website where that guy was 
asking: &quot;Does this really teach us how to create a language?&quot;.
After that question I started to ask myself the same question, as the 
book isn't exactly what it sounds.

I would go with something with &quot;Language Recognition Patterns&quot; or 
&quot;Language Parsing Patterns&quot;. Yes, its not as catchy as &quot;Design 
Patterns&quot;, but the book isn't really about designing languages anyway. 
Also, it relates to ANTLR and what it does without adding &quot;ANTLR&quot; to the 
title, as you don't want it to be tool specific.

I don't think that DSL should go anywhere in the title or subtitle, 
since the techniques there can be applied to anything.

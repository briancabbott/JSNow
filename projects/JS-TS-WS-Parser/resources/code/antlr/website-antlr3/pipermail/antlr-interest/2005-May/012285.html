I'm off on holiday for 2 weeks on Thursday, and I think I'm rapidly 
running up against the law of diminishing returns here (I don't actually 
need Java at all in my app; I was just hoping to do a sanity check 
before converting your grammar to C++. I can tell you, I'm going to be 
*really* grateful to dump the various Java compilers/VMs/assorted bits 
I've downloaded over the last couple of weeks).

And, I mean this in the nicest possible way, but I've already tried 3 
compilers (and failed to build a fourth, as well as failing to download 
a fifth, and installed a new OS along the way), so I can't immediately 
see that trying a sixth is going to bring anything to the party. If it 
works with javac 1.4 then I'm not sure that we've actually learnt 
anything. I just needed a sanity check to make sure that I wasn't being 
stupid.

Thanks -

Paul

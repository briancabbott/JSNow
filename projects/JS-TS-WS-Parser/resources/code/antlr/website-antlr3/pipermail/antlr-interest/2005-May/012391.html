 &gt; Howdy,

 &gt; In the old days, public domain was the most generous license to use  for 
software.  Oddly enough, now it's not good at all.  I think a  large company 
with 3 letters in their name has emailed me like 4  times from different 
groups asking if I have a certification from  every contributor of patches 
over the last 15 years that they had the  right to submit the patch and that 
they granted me a license etc...   You get the picture.  Basically, nobody 
wants to use software anymore  that could include stolen work etc...
 &gt;
 &gt; Going forward, I must ask that people submit everything through the 
website, which will track everything and have a &quot;contributor's  license&quot; 
agreement etc...  It just asks that you certify you created  whatever you're 
sending in and give me license to do whatever I want  with it.  Here is my 
tentative language (in the box at the bottom):

 &gt; Comments on the language and/or issues?


Well, it seems still to be somewhat fragile. I think the clean &amp; sure way 
would be something like:
I transfer the copyright of this submission to Terence Parr. This tranfer is 
effective immediately, it is permanent and irrevocable. I certify that I 
have the full legal right to do the aforementioned transfer, and I certify 
that my work does not violate any third party rights. I give Terence Parr 
the right to declare in any form, that I'm the contributor of the product 
according to product's licence (BSD licence). The aforementioned declaration 
mans puting my name (but tnothing more) in any published form of 
contributors list.


This last 2 sentences might be important in many juristiction (most of 
Europe, I think) where there are strong provacy protection laws.

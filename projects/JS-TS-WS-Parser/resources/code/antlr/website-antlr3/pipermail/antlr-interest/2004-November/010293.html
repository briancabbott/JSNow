Hi Andy,

Read your paper and my overall impression is this:

Yes, anything that an ANTLR tree parser can do can also be done in
other ways including the tree-library approach that you describe.
Nevertheless, I consider the tree-grammar approach to be the &quot;best&quot;
choice from an engineering point of view. You get the most bang for
the least amount of work. Alexey's TreeDL approach also has some
positives from an engineering pov.

My other impression was that you haven't grokked the tree-grammar
approach yet. It can take a while as my posts to the list attest but,
it's time well spent if you intend to build complex language
analysis/transformation tools with ANTLR.

Section-secific comments:
=========================

1. The Complex Case: Tranforming a C AST to a Java AST
======================================================

The tree-library approaches you outline rely on methods that would
seem to involve significant local (and/or global) tree
navigation/searching and analysis. Take getAllGlobalVarNames() for
instance - in the general case it would have to search the entire
input AST (or AST forest in the multi-file case) to build up this
list. Similarly for getAllLocalVarNames (localized search) and
findDeclaration (global search).

With the typical tree-grammar approach, a symbol table is built
(either during parsing or as a separate phase) and is then use to
answer queries such as &quot;is this a global var declaration?&quot; or &quot;get all
global var declarations&quot; very efficiently. Some times, the structure
of the tree encodes such information. For instance, it may be that
global var declarations are always children COMPILATION_UNIT nodes. So
you might have:

compilationUnit
 :  #( COMPILATION_UNIT
       ( .......
       |  variableDeclaration[VarDeclarationKind.Global]
       | ......
       )*
    )
 ;
 
statementList
 :  #( STMT_LIST
       ( .......
       |  variableDeclaration[VarDeclarationKind.Local]
       | ......
       )*
    )
 ;
 
variableDeclaration [VarDeclarationKind varKind]
 : #( VARIABLE_DEF type
      ( ID ( variableInitialization )?
        {
           if (varKind == VarDeclarationKind.Global)
           {
             // process global variable decl
           }
           else
           {
             // process non-global variable decl
           }
        }
      )*
    )
  ;

To be able to answer queries such as &quot;get all VAR_REF nodes that refer
to this declaration&quot; efficiently, you would have added appropriate
attributes during the symbol table construction pass(es). In fact, it
is helpful to think of the information in the symbol table as
attributes of nodes in the AST (which is what they are in fact). They
are just designed for very fast lookup.


2a. Keeping the TreeStack and SymbolTable in sync with the AST
==============================================================

I don't understand the need for a TreeStack. If what we are talking
about is renaming a local variable then, following on from the grammar
snippets in my previous comments:

variableDeclaration [VarDeclarationKind varKind]
 : #( VARIABLE_DEF type
      ( varid:ID ( variableInitialization )?
        {
           if (varKind == VarDeclarationKind.Global)
           {
             // process global variable decl
           }
           else
           {
             // process non-global variable decl
             IBinding varDecl = #varid.Binding;
             if (thisVarNeedsRenaming(varDecl,....))
             {
             	string....
             	renameLocalVarTo(varDecl, #varid, getNewNameFor(varDecl));
             }
           }
        }
      )*
    )
  ;

Where renameLocalVarTo() might is a method that looks something like:

void renameLocalVarTo(IBinding decl, ISimpleIdentNode node, string
newName)
{
   IList refNodes = node.getAllReferringNodes();
   foreach(INode refnode in refNodes)
   {
      refnode.setText(newName);
   }
   node.setText(newName);
   
   decl.Scope.rename(decl, newName);  // a) removes decl and it's key
from scope dictionary
                                      // b) re-inserts decl with a new key
}


2b. Do you want methods in AST or TreeStack?
============================================

decl.Scope.getAllBindings() or similar should give you a list of all
names in the scope. This isn't a tree-grammar approach benefit. ANTLR
does nothing to help or hinder the requirement that the symbol table
code has to be written.

Since the symbol table stores extended node attributes, there isn't a
question of which is more &quot;natural&quot;. The binding attribute on the node
is where the actions starts:
  IBinding decl  = #varid.Binding;
  IList bindings = decl.Scope.getAllBindings();


2c. Sometimes you need multiple passes
======================================

Given all the information that the symbol table construction phase
accumulates, it would be pretty easy to provide a getAllGlobalVar()
method on the symbol table object itself. Combined with the
getAllReferringNodes() method on the nodes, what you propose is
trivially accomplished. And without expensive (re-)calculation.


3. The Simple Case: PrettyPrinting an AST
=========================================

There are two general approaches to pretty printing with a tree-grammar:
a) Embed the knowledge of how to print each AST element within the
tree-grammar
     builtInType [Writer output]
      :   &quot;void&quot;	{ output.write(&quot;void&quot;); }
      |   &quot;boolean&quot;	{ output.write(&quot;boolean&quot;); }
          ........
      ;

b) Use hetero-AST classes that know how to print themselves to a
stream or writer. The tree-grammar simple invokes the class's print()
method and supplies the stream or writer.
     builtInType [Writer output]
      :   v:&quot;void&quot;	{#v.print(output);}
      |   b:&quot;boolean&quot;	{#b.print(output);}
          ........
      ;


4. Comparing approaches by analyzing ease of change
===================================================

In your third change - we want three blank lines after the &quot;package&quot;
line instead of two - I can't understand why there is any confusion in
the tree-grammar approach. If you are adding lines *after* the output
from the package rule and, the rootID rule calls the package rule then
the change would be in the rootID rule. In your description, it is
clear that the rootID rule prints the current two lines in any case.

In your fourth change - we want to change the order of printing...and
print the static block before the variable declarations for example -
you can simply employ multiple output writers. Buffer all static
blocks in one writer, all variable declarations in another etc. At the
end print contents of the various writers in any order you wish. No
need to modify the AST structure.


5. Limitations of TreeWalkers
=============================

I don't see a tree-grammar limitation here Andy. I may be wrong but,
isn't the real problem that &quot;a[3]&quot; is an array access while &quot;int[] x&quot;
is an array declaration?. If I am right they would have difference AST
representations in any case.

In any case, I can't provide a tree-grammar equivalent of your sample
without knowing what the child of the ARRAY_DECLARATOR is when it
isn't an EXPR. In other words without knowing a bit more about your
tree's grammar.


6. Contrasting the approaches
=============================

1. Code generation isn't magic. We all use it quite happily for lexers
and parsers for instance. The same benefits exist for tree parsers.

2. It can be argued that the tree-grammar approach actually encourages
your &quot;keep related code together&quot; maxim. All the code (excluding
library code) that applies to a phase of your transformation is kept
together in one file - the grammar file.

3. Complex tools require training investment before you can use then
effectively. Having invested in training to be able to ANTLR notation
for specifying lexers and parsers, tree parsers are the next logical step.

4. The comments about debugging apply equally to generated tree
parsers and hand-written tree walkers (they are often very similar).
The tree structure is the same in any case so print the AST as you please.

5. ANTLR support for hetero-ASTs could be improved but nothing you
have mentioned so far is beyond the support ANTLR 2.7.4's hetero-AST
support. Can you give an example where this is important?


7. Summary
==========

All I can say is that the two approaches you present here are tools
for getting a job done. If you've invested the time to learn both
approaches and you feel the tree-library approach offers you more then
by all means use it. 

I suspect however that you are yet to fully grok the tree-grammar
approach. What information or resources would help you to better
understand the tree-grammar approach?. Perhaps knowing this would help
in making ANTLR v3 docs even more useful.

Cheers!

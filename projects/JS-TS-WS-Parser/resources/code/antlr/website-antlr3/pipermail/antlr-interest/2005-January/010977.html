<PRE>Look at post-relational. The obvious problem is that I don't know of a
fully-functional Free implementation. MaVerick is getting close, though
:<i>-)
</I>
Basically, that gives you a normal-form database, but that would
probably drive relational purists nuts. Describing it in terms I don't
quite understand myself ...

Think of each &quot;row&quot; in a post-relational &quot;table&quot; as an object - bit like
a relational view, or actually probably more like a tree. It's been
normalised, so a mechanical transform enables you to present it to a
relational client. And you can relate fields across tables, although the
mechanism is very different from a SQL/relational join.

I've been thinking about this sort of thing, and was thinking that
trying to get MaVerick or some other post-relational engine into either
an LDAP server or gentoo portage would actually be an excellent
demonstration of its power ...

For your problem, once you've parsed all the dependencies into a
database, I would use a simple procedural routine to look for loops etc.

Cheers,
Wol

Hi,
if you need a relational schema this depends largely on the degree of
normalization you want to reach. E.g. you could either split up
everything into specific tables which would result in quite an amount of
tables, more programming effort and more load on the dbms. If you opt
for less normalization you could just write some of the fields into
single varchar entries which would have to be parsed by the application.
To achieve the &quot;or&quot; relations you might need to invent some kind of
&quot;meta-packages&quot; (like spell-check engine) which can be provided by
several other packages. Gentoo does this via &quot;virtual&quot; packages, e.g.
both Xfree and X.org provide &quot;virtual/X11&quot; in Gentoo.
Anyway for resolving complete dependencies you would either write a
_really_ complex SQL query or just pull the logic &quot;A needs B, B needs C
--&gt; A needs C&quot; into your application.

HTH,
Martin

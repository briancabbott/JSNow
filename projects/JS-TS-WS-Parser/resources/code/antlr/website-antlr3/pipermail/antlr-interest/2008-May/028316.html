Well, I'm not sure why it's freezing on you (except maybe the DFA 
combination explosion is killing it), but I can tell you that your 
grammar can't possibly work.

&gt;<i>charLiteral : '\'' CHAR_CONTENTS '\'';
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>stringLiteral :    '&quot;' STRING_CONTENTS? '&quot;';
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>CHAR_CONTENTS : (~('\''|'\\') | ('\\' .))+;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>STRING_CONTENTS : (~('&quot;'|'\\') | ('\\' .))+;
</I>
There is no useful distinction betweeen the CHAR_CONTENTS and 
STRING_CONTENTS rules; and since they are non-fragment lexer rules 
they are both viable targets.  This will typically result in 
STRING_CONTENTS never being generated and CHAR_CONTENTS being 
generated in places you weren't expecting it to.

You should change CHAR_CONTENTS and STRING_CONTENTS into fragment 
rules and then change charLiteral and stringLiteral into lexer 
rules, not parser rules.

Perhaps you haven't realised that the lexing phase is entirely 
separate from the parser?  Lexer rules are run and generate tokens 
completely independently of how they're used in parser rules.

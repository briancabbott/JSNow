<PRE>Hi, 
   
  Thank you very much for replying to my post. For simplicity I have left them empty as the rule is quite large and I thought not to bother you guys. I thought the problem was the * sign in the rule but it was not. 
   
  I have sorted out the looping problem. However a problem still remains and that is how to write the rewrite rule. Could you please suggest me a rewrite rule for the following? 
   
  r:  a  ( c | d )*  ( e | f )? g
;
   
  Many thanks in advance.
   
  Best wishes,
   
  Al

  How can rules like the following ( r ) be dealt with without producing an infinite loop? Can you also tell me what the rewrite rule for it should look like?

Don't write empty rules -- trying to match multiple instances of nothing at all is an instant infinite loop.

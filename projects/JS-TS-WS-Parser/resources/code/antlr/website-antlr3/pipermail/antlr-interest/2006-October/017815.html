Hi Paul,

   Yes as long as the language (i.e., structure) is the same, in-line  
transformation is good.

&gt;<i> 2 - if your language has compound assignments (ie. something like  
</I>&gt;<i> 'a += b') then it's pointless and confusing to keep this in the  
</I>&gt;<i> tree, and it complicates code generation. Why do not just replace  
</I>&gt;<i> the branch with another branch that unrolls the assignment? What if  
</I>&gt;<i> your language is even worse than this - 'x = a += b, a + c'? I  
</I>&gt;<i> expect you all know what language that is.
</I>
   Again the language is the same.  No problem.

&gt;<i> 3 - Similarly, if your language has incr/decr operators, these are  
</I>&gt;<i> easily handled by modifying the AST to unroll them.
</I>
   Same language.

   Same answer to all of the below...

Ter
&gt;<i> 4 - What if your operators have side-effects, which you can't  
</I>&gt;<i> handle till the next sequence point? Doing this in a single static  
</I>&gt;<i> tree is very difficult. It's simple if you construct a new  
</I>&gt;<i> expression and insert it into the tree at some later point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5 - what if your language has multiple ways to do the same thing?  
</I>&gt;<i> Indirection and array access, for example? It makes little sense to  
</I>&gt;<i> code this redundancy into the AST. You can instead have a pass  
</I>&gt;<i> which, for example, eliminates indirections and replaces them with  
</I>&gt;<i> array accesses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And so on. Bottom line - the AST should represent the programmer's  
</I>&gt;<i> intent, which is never obvious from the bare syntax of whatever  
</I>&gt;<i> language they attempted to code that intent in. Sometimes, it can  
</I>&gt;<i> take you many passes to find out what that intent actually was. Why  
</I>&gt;<i> tie one arm behind your back by sticking with your first AST till  
</I>&gt;<i> the bitter end?

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Benjamin,

</I>&gt;<i> I was meddling around with the stg templates for Python in trying to

</I>&gt;<i> the files in antlr-3.4-complete.jar this problem was alleviated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I narrowed down the diff and discovered that the stg templates in the

</I>&gt;<i> \n), and that removing all the carriage returns in
</I>&gt;<i> org/antlr/codegen/templates/Python/Python.stg solved the issue of the
</I>&gt;<i> elif being split across a newline.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That certainly explains why it only showed in antlr-3.4-complete.jar,
</I>&gt;<i> since the templates included with antlr-3.4.tar.gz did not have the
</I>&gt;<i> carriage returns. :)
</I>
Good catch, thanks a lot for figuring that out.
That seems like a bug in stringtemplate to me - I thought it was
smarter about dealing with line endings.

Ter:
Was the jar built on a windows box? I assume perforce adds the CRLFs
when checking out the files under windows - the files are stored as
&quot;text&quot;, i.e. line endings are converted to the native system.
Unless ST can be taught to deal with that properly, we could store the
templates as binary in the repository - but that could be messy when
someone actually wants to edit them under windows and it's hard to
notice when CRs creep back in.
Or avoid building jars on windows ;)
This probably affects other targets as well, but those are probably
less picky about some extra whitespace here and there. Could lead to
some obscure bugs though.

Actually, what Ter's parse tree approach provides is stepwise
derivation output.  It's an elegant way of getting canonical output
which is useful for analysis.  I've extended it to tree grammars and
am pretty pleased with the results.  It is true that refactoring will
change the output, but that could be fixed with a comparison tool;
manual analysis is less cumbersome than you would think.  Also,
derivation output is a good step in determining line coverage for
grammars.  We need to devise some support tools, but I really do
believe that we have finally hit upon the right path for grammar testing.

I am not sure what problem it is you are describing here Megan. ANTLR
generated parsers (in Java, C++ and C#) can trivially process input
text that contains procedures/methods in excess of the 1-2K lines you
mentioned.

Running the lexer/parser for the ANTLR Java grammar on the
ANTLR-generated lexer for the Java grammar is one way to convince your
self that ANTLR C# can handle long procedures.

&gt;<i> The other odd thing about this is that the large procedures 
</I>&gt;<i> consist of assignment statements, one per line. That's it.
</I>&gt;<i> No big expressions. The overflow is related strictly to the 
</I>&gt;<i> number of lines in a procedure, not the complexity of the 
</I>&gt;<i> expressions or anything else. The stack, as it is related to the
</I>&gt;<i> grammar definition, is not growing with the size of the procedure. 
</I>&gt;<i> I know the grammar rules are closing properly because I have run
</I>&gt;<i> a great deal of code through this translator and I am intimately
</I>&gt;<i> familiar with the parse traces. This makes me think that there
</I>&gt;<i> may be a basic clean-up problem happening here..? 
</I>
Did you track the resource usage for your parser?. 
If you have a basic version of the grammar without embedded action
code, does it still report the same error?

&gt;<i> Can anyone out there who is using antlr java or C++ comment on 
</I>&gt;<i> stack overflow problems for large source.  Is there one 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation platform that is better, do they all have this
</I>&gt;<i> problem? Is this a .Net memory management problem? Comments
</I>&gt;<i> appreciated!
</I>
Some of my input source files have been greater than 1MB with ANTLR
C#/Java/C++ generated lexers/parsers. Incidentally, 1MB isn't some
some of limit, I just mentioned that because I have fed files of that
size to C# parsers successfully. And the parsers built the AST without
any issues.

Actually, if memory serves, the system parsed the 1MB+ files (they
were about a dozen in the set) and lots of other source files (read
hundreds) and stitched their ASTs together into a single forest.

Cheers,

Micheal

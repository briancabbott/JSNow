Erm.. sorry.. erm but why? Why use some C-style encoding scheme from an
ancient time where a struct (or class in java) can do the trick and give
you the value added bonus that a compiler (byte code compiler?) that's
smart enough can encode the struct in some way for you and you don't have
to bother about the shifting yourself (and e.g. use a 64-bit value when
it's possible). Well anyway if it's only in the analysis I don't care, if
it ends up in the support lib I'd be somewhat carefull in doing 'hacks'
like this...

&gt;<i> I don't want to go to 64-bit ints as most CPUs are still 32bits

I would not welcome going 64 bits on the C++ side. This is all pretty new
tech and I already saw some things float about in bugtrackers here and
there about 64 bit issues with some compilers/support libraries.
Furthermore it probably slows down 32 bitters (current majority of systems
I don't expect 64 bit going to be mainstream soon, there's very little
benefit to it as of yet).

&gt;<i> I want to do unicode &quot;right&quot; this time.  Anybody have a strong opinion
</I>&gt;<i> about the new supplemental (beyond 16bit unicode) char values and/or
</I>&gt;<i> whether 2048 is a serious token type limitation?
</I>
Why use a data-structure that limits you from the outset??? Is a
struct/class that much slower in analysis that you're using an encoding
scheme like this. (I'd expect seeing this kindoff stuff in old C programs
where people are trying to squeeze extra cycles/memory out of something)
Remember premature optimization is the root of all evil....

Cheers,

Ric

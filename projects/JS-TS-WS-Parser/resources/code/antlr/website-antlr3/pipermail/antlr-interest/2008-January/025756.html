<PRE>Actually, I ended up using HIDEN. Skip() did something weird when
parsing  one of my clauses (It might have been my bug, obviously). It
seemed to put parsing into an infinite loop... I do not have details on
this, so do not want to confuse anyone... I will report it if I get back
to this and get more information on this.

Cheers

So I take it that in general (unless you have memory limitations or
want to avoid creating unnecessary tokens) you want to use $channel =
HIDDEN?

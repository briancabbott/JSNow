Ooops, it's compiling now. But not .class created like Stuart said.

I'm using SUN's compiler (i think).

Cheers,
Diane

What compiler are you using?  It works for me with javac 1.5.0_13 on MacOS X 10.5.2.  I thought I noticed a message going by that said that gcj has a problem with it; but that may be my imagination.
Peace- John

Thanks for the replies.

But if it's valid, why wouldn't it work for me. Could be because of the java version I'm using (1.5)?

I think that the reason for this is basically historical.  It comes from C++, where a class definition must be followed by a &quot;;&quot;.  Java decided not to require that semicolon, but then needed some way to allow it.  If you read the Java Language Specification (3rd edition, 2005) by James Gosling et al., section 7.6 specifically says that &quot;;&quot; is a valid type declaration; that is, a TypeDeclaration is defined as a ClassDeclaration or an InterfaceDeclaration or a &quot;;&quot;.
Furthermore it is entirely reasonable to have a Java file with no types declared in it.  In fact the JLS suggests that package annotations occur in a file whose only other content is the package declaration.  The JLS suggests that &quot;The sole annotated package declaration, if it exists, is placed in a source file called package-info.java in the directory containing the source files for the package.  ... Typically package-info.java contains only a package declaration, preceded immediately by the annotations on the package.  While the file could technically contain the source code for one or more package-private classes, it would be very bad form.&quot; (ibid, pp. 158-159).
Peace- John

I also tried gcj, and managed to break that:

/tmp/ccIIuwWz.jar:0: internal compiler error: in java_parse_file, at java/jcf-parse.c:1951
Please submit a full bug report,
with preprocessed source if appropriate.
See &lt;URL:<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugs.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/bugs.html</A>&gt; for instructions.
For Debian GNU/Linux specific bug reporting instructions,
see &lt;URL:<A HREF="file:///usr/share/doc/gcc-4.2/README.Bugs">file:///usr/share/doc/gcc-4.2/README.Bugs</A>&gt;.
It looks like a good grammar should accept this, but clearly not all compilers comply. 

It's been ages since my last &quot;internal compiler error&quot; - it's made my day!!!

This is the same as the grammar rule in the Java spec at: <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/syntax.doc.html">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/syntax.doc.html</A>

I was surprised by this, and being curious, I just successfully compiled a Java source file containing only a single semicolon. It seems a bit  pointless to me, but it is valid Java! 

All the best
Stuart


Diane Nkonyereza wrote:Hi all,

I have a question on the latest Java grammar. The question is related to the typeDeclaration rule.

- What is the ';' in the typeDeclaration Rule? Can someone please gives me an example of when the ';' could be an option or is it possible to just have ';' in java file and compile it successfully?
   
typeDeclaration
    :   classOrInterfaceDeclaration
    |   ';'
    ;Regards,
Diane.

<PRE>I'm sure Rob will join in when he sees this ... he wrote the MaVerick
DATABASIC grammar.

But that was originally written to spit out java source to feed into the
java compiler. He then wrote another emitter to spit out java p-code.

So why don't you start with (B), making sure that the &quot;output as C#&quot;
stage is an independent module, and then move on to step (C) later,
replacing it with an &quot;output as MSIL&quot; module.

Cheers,
Wol

Subject: [antlr-interest] C# vs MSIL Output

I'm beginning a project to create a .NET mini-language for performing
data
transformations.  I'm currently debating which of following would be
best:

A) compile the language into a data structure that is used by a runtime
engine to perform the transformations
B) compile the language into C# code that performs the transformations
(after a second compilation)
C) compile the language directly to MSIL (.NET virtual machine
assembly-like
language) that performs the transformations

Here's a breakdown of how I see these approaches comparing based on 3
criteria: ease of implementation, execution speed, and compilation speed

Option    Implementation  execution  compilation
-------------------------------------------------
A         easy            slow       fast
B         medium          fast       slow
C         hard            fast       medium

I'm currently leaning towards C, because a) it appears to have the best
trade off between execution and compilation speed b) it is the approach
taken by XSLTC (albeit in Java) and NMock, and c) it sounds like fun.
However, I am aware that ANTLR choose option B for its C#/.NET code
generator.  Would the designers of that piece care to share some insight
with me?

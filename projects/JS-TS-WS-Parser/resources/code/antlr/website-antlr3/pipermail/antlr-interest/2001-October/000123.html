Yep.  I'm madly running diff on Ric's branch with the main line code to 
see what has happened while I've been &quot;asleep&quot; ;)  My favorite line is 
&quot;huh...did I write that?&quot;

Teaser: i'm anticipating another &quot;Dr. T's Traveling Parsing Revival and 
Beer Tasting Festival&quot; workshop next April or so in San Francisco Bay 
Area.  I want to focus on tree construction, translation, and output 
generation.  Lots of stuff brewing from the mysterious 
ANTLR-sleeper-agent-extraordinaire at JPL, Loring Craymer.  I've got 
some splendiferous output/generation grammar stuff brewing also that I 
use to generate the jGuru.com website etc...  Heh maybe we can get Ric's 
university to fly him here or we can all chip in a few drachmas to 
attenuate the cost.  He can also sleep down on Haight street here in SF 
with the hippies to save money and I here Eucalyptus tree bark makes 
good soup (or was that the stuff that turns you into a hippy?). ;)

First priority is getting 2.7.2 out...

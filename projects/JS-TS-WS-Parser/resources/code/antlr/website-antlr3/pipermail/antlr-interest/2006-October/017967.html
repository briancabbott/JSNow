Tree transformation is great if you are going from language L to L. I  
think that managing Union tree grammars when moving from L to L' is  
too much of a hassle.  But, that is just my opinion.

   An appropriate transformation.

&gt;&gt;<i> ANTLR 3 was not designed

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> _not_ to support such transformations, for that matter.

   Yes, it is my intention that you can output trees.  I had to cut  
that out of the first release so I could do a feature freeze and  
focus on bugs.  You will note that the wiki has:

+grammars

  from July 27.

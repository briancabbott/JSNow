<PRE>Hi All,
This is to announce the release of WebStringTemplates V1.4
(based on Terence's StringTemplates).

WebStringTemplate and a detailed tutorial is available from
<A HREF="http://www.forward.com.au/webstringtemplates">http://www.forward.com.au/webstringtemplates</A>

An outline follows.

all the best

WebStringTemplates V1.4
The better Java template engine.

Programmers, work in Java/JSP without HTML.
   System Architects, specify the interface.
      Web Designers, leave Java/JSP to the Programmers.


WebStringTemplates is an easy to use Java template engine that separates web
page design from the server coding. It defines a clean data interface
between the the servlet/JSP and the web page. This Data Interface Definition
file defines what data is available and provides sample data for development
purposes. Once this interface is defined as a HTML document, the Web Page
Designer and the Programmer can independently do their jobs without
interfering with each other. It is the Programmer's responsiblity to ensure
the data specified is available and correctly formatted, without having to
worry about where it will be displayed on the page. It is the Web Page
Designer's responsibility to display the data in a pleasing manner, with
roll overs, drop down menus etc., but without having to worry about the
actual data being displayed.

WebStringTemplates is free for commercial use, subject to its licence.
Download it from <A HREF="http://www.forward.com.au/webstringtemplates">http://www.forward.com.au/webstringtemplates</A>

WebStringTemplates is an extension of Terence Parr's excellent
StringTemplate package. WebStringTemplates makes some small modifications to
the syntax, adds the Data Interface Definition file and its parser, the Web
Page Designer's interactive viewing tool, comment attributes, data filters,
support routines to simplify converting existing JSP pages and servlets and
this documentation. WebStringTemplate also uses Terence's Antlr complier
generator to parse the Data Interface Definition file.


Why do I need WebStringTemplates?
----------------------------------------
If you are a Web Designer, then to take full advantage of JSP, you must
first learn Java which is time consuming and can be quite challenging. Then
you need to set up a server to develop and test JSPs which can be a
confusing and frustrating task. Wouldn't you prefer to just stick to HTML

If you are a Programmer, then with JSP it is still to easy to mix HTML code
with business logic, with each one making it hard to understand the other.
Wouldn't you prefer to just code the business logic and leave the HTML to
the web designer.

If you are a System Architect, the mixing of HTML and Java code / JSP tags
makes it difficult to separate the page design from the coding/business
logic design and changes in one risk interfering with the operation of the
other. There is no clear, well defined interface between the two. Wouldn't
you like to be able to define a clear, clean interface that separates the
code from the web page.

WebStringTemplates solves all of these problems. See the on-line tutorial
for more details. The tutorial has separate sections for the Web Designer,
the System Architect and the Programmer.


How is WebStringTemplates different from other 'template engines'?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
WebStringTemplates allows the System Architect to define a Data Interface
Definition between the Programmer and the Web Page Designer which they both
work to. WebStringTemplates is also easy to use. Web Designers do not have
to learn another language. They don't need access to a running server and
they can use their existing tools to develop their pages. For Programmers,
the small number of classes, detailed tutorial and built-in debugging makes
them productive faster. For the Programmer, WebStringTemplates also provides
extendable data filters to handle html escape sequences and other data
transformation requirements.


WebStringTemplate Features
-------------------------------------------------

WebStringTemplates For the Web Page Designer

A clean, clearly defined and commented Data Interface Definition file in
HTML format.
All the data is in pre-formatted strings, no programming needed.
A few simple template commands that are quick and easy to use.
An interactive design tool to help develop the templates and check the
results. No need to continually go back to the programmer to test the
results. No need to have access to a servlet server to develop the web
pages.
Work with your existing HTML editing tools on your own machine.
Deliver a result that you know fits the programming specification.
Simple documentation with detailed examples.

WebStringTemplates For the System Architect

A Data Interface Definition file that provides a means of defining and
controlling the project without limiting the creativity of either the Web
Page Designer or the Programmer.
Insert comment fields in the data definition to describe its format and use.
Supports internationalization of templates and data.
Caching of templates and data for increased performance.
The clear clean interface definition makes project definition compliance a
yes/no question.
Allows you to concentrate on the data flow without worrying about the code
or page layout.
Not tightly bound to the server, can be added to any servlet server so it
does not limit your choices.

WebStringTemplates For the Programmer

A means to get rid of all that messy HTML code and to be able to concentrate
on implementing the business rules and generating the required data.
The Data Interface Definition file makes it easy to check when the job is
finished.
Extendible Data Filters to automate data transformations such as escaping &lt;
&gt;<i>.
</I>Introspection to extract data from Java Beans and flexible handling of
arrays and maps simplifies programming.
Extensive debugging features let you see what will be passed to the
template.
Caching of templates and data for increased performance.
Generate a Data Interface Definition file from a JSP or servlet. Use it to
generate a Data Interface Definition for an existing JSP or servlet. Use it
for debugging and to check the final code for compliance with the interface
definition.
The ability to load default data, including chunks of HTML formatted text.
Supports i18n using the same encoding method as Java property files.
Simple interface to existing JSP or servlet code.
Not tightly bound to the server, can be added to any servlet server.
Extensive documentation on how to use WebStringTemplates with new or
existing server code.

<PRE>Luciana asked:
&gt;<i> I would like to know how can I generate output. For example: if anyone 
</I>&gt;<i> writes &quot;a is equal to b&quot;, I would like to generate &quot;a == b&quot;. 
</I>
It looks like you are very close;  you have &quot;is equal to&quot; generate
&quot;==&quot;.  If everything is this direct, then you can simply have the
identifiers generate their names and you're done.

I think you should just keep doing what you are doing - perhaps start
with a simpler grammar that just recognizes &quot;a equals b&quot; (and nothing
else), the better to understand ANTLR in isolation from your problem.

Once you are able to process &quot;a equals b&quot;, you can start to focus on
the problem (language recognition), rather than the tools you will be
using (ANTLR).

Remember that ANTLR just provides a framework for parsing a language,
for walking and manipulating parse trees, and for performing
user-specied actions when particular patterns (sequences, for parsing;
tree shapes, for tree parsers). are detected.  It is up to you to
figure out what actions are needed.

In your case, it sounds like it's &quot;generate the equivalent java&quot; - and
your grammar already has some of that in it.

an adj of Design.  it's ambiguous though. Using Lang Impl Design

Favor &quot;engineering&quot; or &quot;construction&quot; or the like over &quot;design&quot;, and go for
something suggestive from linguistics or culture for the title.  E.g.
&quot;Towers of Babel:  Building DSLs for a Chaotic World&quot;.  Ok, silly, but you
get the idea.

When I hear the &quot;design&quot;, even though (or because) it covers pretty much
everything, I tend not to think of the design that goes into implementation.
 If you're really emphasizing design in implementation, maybe something that
highlights the role of design as a distinct element of engineering, e.g.
&quot;Elements of Design in DSL Engineering&quot; (echoing Strunk and White).

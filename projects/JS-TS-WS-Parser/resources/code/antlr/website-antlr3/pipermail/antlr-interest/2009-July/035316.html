<PRE>hi Andrew,

Well, Prashant and I have been discussing this for years now. After  
talking to the netbeans and javafx teams as well, I've come to the  
conclusion it's not the best use of my time. It's a really hard  
problem (and least the lexer is; parser is easy incrementally) and  
computers are fast enough now that is just not worth me going crazy  
over it.  Sorry to say...you should be fine though; we're talking  
about an O(n) process fortunately.

  glad you like the LDP book!

</I>&gt;<i> I remember there was a talk about incremental parsing option for ANTLR

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is not much information could be found about incremental parsing
</I>&gt;<i> and most of them (or all of them), are related to LR parser. It seems
</I>&gt;<i> like it's not very known topic. Or maybe it's not needed so much? On
</I>&gt;<i> the other hand, Language Design Patterns is mostly about LL parser.
</I>&gt;<i> And I think discussing this topic in this book for LL parser would add
</I>&gt;<i> a great value to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, there is always something more to ask and you never can
</I>&gt;<i> have it all... right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any comments? Can you share your opinion about this topic and how
</I>&gt;<i> important it is?

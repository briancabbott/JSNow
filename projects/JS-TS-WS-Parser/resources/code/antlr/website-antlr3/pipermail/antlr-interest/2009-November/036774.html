<PRE>Hi all.

I have been building a google-like query syntax parser in ANTLR (C#). This
is the first work I have done with ANTLR, or any parser generator, so it has
been quite an experience.

I want the user to be able to use &quot;and&quot; and &quot;or&quot; to combine search terms
e,g. &quot;(apple or microsoft) and tablet and office&quot;. But I also want the user
to be able to enter a simple set of words and implicitly treat it as though
they are joined by &quot;and&quot; e.g. &quot;apple tablet office windows&quot; would be treated
as &quot;apple and tablet and office and windows&quot;

So far, I have been unable to get a syntax that correctly handles implicit
&quot;ands&quot; between sets of words.

Here is a snippet of my current grammar that works properly with an explicit
&quot;and&quot;:

expression
    : andexpression (OR_OP^ andexpression)*
    ;

andexpression
options {
backtrack=true;
}
    : atom (AND_OP^ atom)*
    ;



The problem is that I need the &quot;and&quot; to form the root of the AST subtree,
which doesn't go well if the &quot;and&quot; isn't actually there. Even with
lookahead/backtrack I can't find the right syntax to make it work.

In wanting the AND_OP to be optional, I had to move away from the tree
construction operators because the following would not work:

andexpression
    : atom (AND_OP?^ atom)*
    ;

Ideally, I thought I needed to make andexpression look like this:

andexpression
options {
backtrack=true;
}
    : l=atom (AND_OP? r=atom)* -&gt; ^(AND_OP $l $r?)+
    ;



But I get RewriteEmptyStreamException parsing strings where words are not
joined by 'and', for example &quot;sheep dog fish&quot;.

If anybody has any tips on how to make my &quot;and&quot; optional, it would be much
appreciated.

Regards

Allen Jones

<PRE>Hi, I am an ANTLR newbie, so I apologize if the answer to this question
ends up being trivial.

I am trying to write an ANTLR lexer for a language that ignores nested
C-style comments. So, something like:

  x = 3 /* /* this is ignored */ as is this */ ;

should just produce four non-hidden tokens: ID = NUMBER ;

I know there are several ways to approach this including using recursive
definitions for the comment tokens as in something like:

 NESTED : '/*' (NESTED | .)* '*/' { $channel = HIDDEN } ;

However, the language in question has the need to consider tokens like:

 /*:bool:*/

as a way of specifying explicit type information. Currently, what I have
gets the nested comments correctly, but then ignores the /*:bool:*/ as
if it is a comment even though I have a separate rule like:

  BOOL : '/*:bool:*/' ;

Is there an easy way around this problem?

Years ago I accomplished something very similar using lex/flex, and
then, later, in SableCC using explicit lexer states where I used a
separate token '/*' to mark the beginning of a comment and then to enter
the &quot;comment&quot; state (and as a side effect bumped up a nested-comment
counter). Since '/*' is shorter than '/*:bool:*/' it did not prevent the
BOOL token from being discovered; explicit states were used to indicate
that the BOOL token should only be scanned if in the &quot;normal&quot; (not the
&quot;comment&quot;) state.

It seems to be that possibly ANTLR's semantic predicates could be used
to solve this problem, but whenever I try as in:

  BOOL : { n == 0 }? '/*:bool:*/' ;

if n &gt; 0 it just throws an exception rather than ignoring that rule.

Any light that can be shed on this will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

- Michael

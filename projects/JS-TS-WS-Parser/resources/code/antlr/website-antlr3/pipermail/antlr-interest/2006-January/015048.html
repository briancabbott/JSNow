</I>&gt;<i>
</I>My pattern matcher is specialized to understand C syntax. The only 
special ability it has is
that you have &quot;v&quot; placeholders that will match a variable or constant, 
and &quot;x&quot; placeholders that will
match anything. So &quot;v1 = strcpy(x)&quot; will match what you'd expect it to 
match, where the matcher
will look for the appropriate right paren.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In order to write a &quot;look for a chunk of code that is really just  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doing a strcpy()&quot; function,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you're going to have to do some real work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>That is very true.  Whether you specify a pattern in your style or in  
</I>&gt;<i>a set of tree grammar patterns is irrelevant, though, right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Only relevent in the sense that one or the other is going to be easier 
to write and read and have
enough flexibility. I find it far easier to read &quot;if (v1=0; v1&lt;v2; 
v1++)&quot; than the equivalent
AST tree structure in ANTLR syntax, especially when you consider that 
we're doing more
than matching AST structure here: when I repeat &quot;v1&quot; there, all the 
&quot;v1&quot;s must match the same
variable. As always, I'm sure that can be done with ANTLR, but I bet it 
muddles things up a bit.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How many ways are there to write your own &quot;strcpy()&quot;, each using a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> few lines?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You could use a &quot;for&quot; or &quot;while&quot; loop. You can reference the array  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using pointer syntax or array syntax,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you can use a pointer to loop through or an index. You can  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> increment the pointer/index with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i++, ++i, or i=i+1. You could just use strcpy() or strncpy(). You  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could wrap strcpy() with your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> own macro or function. You could allocate new memory for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the destination string or assume it's already allocated. You could  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> loop until you hit '\0' or use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> strlen().
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So how do you do that with your patterns?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I can't...I have to write the code. But now that I've written that code 
which checks for all these
patterns, at what point in the grammar to I invoke it? There is no one 
place that it fits. The
treewalker approach is just getting in the way here if I were to use it.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In order to avoid a combinatorial explosion of various patterns to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> look for, you'll need to write
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some code that tries to look chunks of code that seem to be doing  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> strcpy(), and yet is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flexible enough to handles these kinds variations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>We've only heard problems so far without a solution in your  
</I>&gt;<i>style...could you bring some light to how you avoid looking for  
</I>&gt;<i>various patterns of code to find strcpy chunks?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Sorry, I didn't mean to imply that I had an special solution, just a 
bunch of Java code. I was just
answering the other poster's question about &quot;why not just check for 
those 5 lines&quot;.

<PRE>What I do in the gcc project is have tokens aware of the file they came from
as well.  Then it is pretty easy to tell whether a new file has been
included or not.

There are other ways too, like Ter's fieldguide on whitespace preservation
by using a hidden token stream.

You'll have to be more specific about what you mean by making the parser
&quot;aware&quot; of the token change.  There are other ways to do this.  

Your way might work, but exceptions are expensive.  Wait, it won't work
because it will screw up lookahead.  No rule will know about your bad token
and that would be &quot;bad&quot;.

If you don't like having the filename in the token, I would instead put that
&quot;bad&quot; token in a hidden token stream.  You can override consume() to check
the hidden token stream and set your state.  Or it can wait in the hidden
stream and everytime you check that state you could pull in the tokens from
the hidden stream and set state before returning it.

Subject: [antlr-interest] catching an exception in the parser and
continuing - will this work?


I am handling &quot;include files&quot; in my lexer, as in the java example 
provided with antlr.  This means that fact the lexer is in an 
included file is transparent to the parser.

However, it turns out that I want the parser to be made aware of the 
fact that the lexer is in an included file. (Kindly assume that I 
have a sound design reason for this ;-) Given the amount of lookahead 
that may occur, I am sure that the only safe way to do this is by 
putting the correct &quot;notification&quot; on the stream of tokens passed to 
the parser.

Is it possible to have the lexer pass a back a &quot;bad&quot; token (i.e. one 
that the parser can never recognize), catch a resultant exception, 
and then (here's the important part) force the parser to take up 
right where is was when it got the &quot;bad&quot; token?  It would amount to 
skipping over the &quot;bad&quot; token, except that the exception handling 
code would set a flag or two that would be available later to parser 
semantic actions.

I have looked at the exception handling documentation, and sifted 
through my generated parser.  It is not clear to me if my strategy 
will work.

BTW, I am still using antlr 2.7.1 - I want to try to finish what I am 
doing before trying the switch to 2.7.2.

Thanks.

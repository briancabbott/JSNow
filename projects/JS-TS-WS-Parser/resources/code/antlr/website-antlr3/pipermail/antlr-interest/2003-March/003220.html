Well there are ppl using STLPort with antlr afaik. I'm not one of them
gcc's STL version works well enough for me.

&gt;<i> Should i be worried that this post is 30 months old, and it is still 
</I>&gt;<i> not fixed??
</I>
Well fixing this portably turns out not to be that easy. Did you at least
try following the snippet and changing the EOF define to
char_traits&lt;char&gt;::eof() ? Would be nice if it's now supported on some more
platforms. If everything else fails wriggle in a #define of EOF to -1
somewhere. Or find out what STLPort uses for EOF anyway. Problem is that
almost all compiler builders are doing something different with this EOF
stuff. So basically if not many ppl complain don't fix it. And must say
you're the second or so.

Bug reports are also that much easier if information is supplied of say
compiler, platform, STLPort version. Though chances are not very high that
I have time to mess around with installing an STLPort version. So if you
email me with more detailed information I might help in resolving the issue
and indeed fixing it in a later release.

Cheers,

Ric

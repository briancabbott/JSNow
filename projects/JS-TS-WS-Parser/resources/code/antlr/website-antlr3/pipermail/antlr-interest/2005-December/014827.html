<PRE>Hi , Andy

it's a great work you make, very nice.

I'm doing similiar work, .... may you spend some time to make a demo of
translating for newer? such as me. :)

a simple demo as translating

1+1

1 add 1

thank you very much~~

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi guys,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your interest in Jazillian.
</I>&gt;<i> This page: <A HREF="http://www.jazillian.com/does.html">http://www.jazillian.com/does.html</A> gives a flavor for what it
</I>&gt;<i> does, at a high level.
</I>&gt;<i> This page: <A HREF="http://www.jazillian.com/how.html">http://www.jazillian.com/how.html</A> gives a fairly complete
</I>&gt;<i> list of the various transformation
</I>&gt;<i> rules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for a design/implementation document, I don't have a complete one yet
</I>&gt;<i> so I'll try to explain a bit here.
</I>&gt;<i> I apply a series of about 150 transformation rules. Each rule consists
</I>&gt;<i> of a match() method that
</I>&gt;<i> does a pattern match, and an apply() with does the transformation. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, the PrintfRule.match()
</I>&gt;<i> method just looks for a &quot;printf&quot; token, and the PrintfRule.apply()
</I>&gt;<i> method replaces all the tokens in the
</I>&gt;<i> printf statement with tokens for an equivalent Java System.out.println()
</I>&gt;<i> call.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a full class hierarchy of rules. At the top are various abstract
</I>&gt;<i> classes, but also things like
</I>&gt;<i> FileRenameRule, which just renames files to match Java naming
</I>&gt;<i> conventions. At the bottom of the
</I>&gt;<i> rule hierarchy are things like SnippetsRule, which reads a file
</I>&gt;<i> containing simple text transformation rules like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> NULL --&gt; 0   // replace NULL with 0
</I>&gt;<i> unsigned --&gt;         // Java has no unsigned keyword, just delete it
</I>&gt;<i> v1 = sizeof v2 / sizeof (char *); --&gt; v1 = v2.length;  // just one of
</I>&gt;<i> many ways to get string length in C
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that the pattern matcher allows placeholders such as &quot;v1&quot; and &quot;v2&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> above, for which any variable
</I>&gt;<i> can be matched. There is also an &quot;x&quot; placeholder which will match
</I>&gt;<i> anything:
</I>&gt;<i> if (false) { x } --&gt;      // just delete any code that will never get
</I>&gt;<i> used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition to the 150 rules written in Java, there are hundreds of
</I>&gt;<i> these simple pattern-match-and-replace rules.
</I>&gt;<i> All of this is done with streams of tokens on a set of C files. I have
</I>&gt;<i> built a library of various functions for
</I>&gt;<i> working with these token streams for:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> matching patterns and doing replacements, inserts, deletes, moves
</I>&gt;<i> symbol table stuff: finding variable declarations, types, references, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> All the stuff I would have gotten for free if I where doing the
</I>&gt;<i> traditional tree-transform approach: function scopes,
</I>&gt;<i> start and end of variables and statements, etc
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did pay a heavy price to implement my transformations on token streams
</I>&gt;<i> rather than ASTs, but I am still happy
</I>&gt;<i> with the result. For example, I have an elaborate isDeclaration() method
</I>&gt;<i> that tries to figure out if a given token is
</I>&gt;<i> a variable or function declaration by examining nearby tokens. The
</I>&gt;<i> payoff is that I can simply write hundreds of
</I>&gt;<i> rules like the ones above without having to think about ASTs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My GotoRemoverRule is just an implementation of one of the well-known
</I>&gt;<i> goto removal algorithms, adopted to use
</I>&gt;<i> my library of token-stream functions. I handle preprocessor stuff by
</I>&gt;<i> cheating: I've added rules to Monty's
</I>&gt;<i> cgram grammar to handle cpp constructs, but only when they appear where
</I>&gt;<i> people usually put them. In this way,
</I>&gt;<i> I can be smart and make the same changes a human would do (as opposed to
</I>&gt;<i> forcing a user to run cpp before running
</I>&gt;<i> Jazillian). So I can make changes like:
</I>&gt;<i> #define X 1    becomes   public final static int X = 1;
</I>&gt;<i> #define f(x) x+1   becomes  static int f(int x) { return x+1}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (This sharp crowd is now shaking their collective head. &quot;How do you even
</I>&gt;<i> know that x is an int? This
</I>&gt;<i> macro works on any type!&quot; Answer: I looked at every reference of x. &quot;But
</I>&gt;<i> what if you weren't so lucky
</I>&gt;<i> and  you need a &quot;float&quot; version of f? Answer: I'm doing the best I can.
</I>&gt;<i> I either handle that today, or
</I>&gt;<i> will get to it soon :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> C structs, unions, and enums become their own Java classes. I generate
</I>&gt;<i> Java 1.4 code - not generating
</I>&gt;<i> any 1.5 stuff (like enums) yet. I do no magical &quot;make it object
</I>&gt;<i> oriented&quot; tricks: each C file becomes a Java
</I>&gt;<i> class. And I generate the code that a human would generate. For example:
</I>&gt;<i> printf(&quot;i=%d  s=%s\n&quot;);   becomes System.out.println(&quot;i=&quot; + i + &quot; s=&quot; +
</I>&gt;<i> s);
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e. I see that you're ending with a newline, and so calling println. I
</I>&gt;<i> will never generate a Java printf call.
</I>&gt;<i> That would work, but it's not what a real person would do).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pointers are the toughest issue. I basically analyze all pointer usage,
</I>&gt;<i> looking for the three most common
</I>&gt;<i> usages of pointers:
</I>&gt;<i> As an array index (in which case, I change the pointer to a Java int,
</I>&gt;<i> and make the pointee an array
</I>&gt;<i> As some sort of pointer-based data structure (linked list, tree,
</I>&gt;<i> whatever), which requires just minor syntax changes
</I>&gt;<i> As a way of doing pass-by-reference
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I use ANTLR for all C lexing. The only place I use ANTLR for parsing and
</I>&gt;<i> AST generation is for handling
</I>&gt;<i> expressions. Java's boolean type is required in certain places, where C
</I>&gt;<i> programs use an int because
</I>&gt;<i> there's no built-in boolean type. So when we have &quot;if (x)&quot;, I really
</I>&gt;<i> have no choice other than to go ahead
</I>&gt;<i> and build an AST from &quot;x&quot; (which could be a large, complex expression),
</I>&gt;<i> and then walk thru the AST
</I>&gt;<i> replacing various &quot;int&quot; nodes with &quot;boolean&quot; ones.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess that's it off the top of my head. I'll be happy to give more
</I>&gt;<i> specifics if you have questions.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm currently working on a C++ version. I'm proud still have much of my
</I>&gt;<i> sanity left after trying to map
</I>&gt;<i> templates to generics. That's not to say that I'm ever going to get it
</I>&gt;<i> to work, but I see keeping my sanity
</I>&gt;<i> as a big plus :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Andy

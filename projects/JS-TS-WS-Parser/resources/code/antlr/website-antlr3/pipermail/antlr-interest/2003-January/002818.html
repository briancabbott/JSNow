Are you sure? i don't run universe but downloaded their basic manual which 
talks about REM as a comment and the REMainder function, maybe you cannot 
have REM as a valid variable name?  It also talks about the 'format 
expression'(look under FMT function) which i called the ' ' operator.

I think my code and antlr runtime can be compiled under gcj, i believe 
people have done this for other antlr based compilers.

and then someone else comes along as tells me they want to write their 
webapp in basic and could i wrap the servlet api so they can throw away 
PHP.....

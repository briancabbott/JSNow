I did say it'd likely be slower, but I doubt it'd be significantly 
so.  (Looking for presence/absence in a BitSet is an O(1) 
operation, but so is this kind of conditional tree -- and at worst 
case it's only O(n).)

Besides which, small sets could be rendered as switch blocks or a 
simple logical-or expression, which are probably even faster than 
using a BitSet.

 &gt;Prove it.

Indeed.

 &gt;Anyway, why not just use a regular hashed set? The Trove4J 
library
 &gt;has native collections, too.

Some kind of sparse boolean collection would work well (or even 
something more fancy, if you want to indicate the possible 
following rules at end-of-token as well).

But you'll also need some way of specifying whether it's an 
&quot;include&quot; collection or an &quot;exclude&quot; one, so that you only need to 
populate the smaller of the two.  In other words, ~('a' | 'b') 
should be recorded as an &quot;exclude&quot; set of 'a' and 'b', not as an 
&quot;include&quot; set of every character except for 'a' and 'b' (as ANTLR 
v2 did) :)

Although I still think just generating the matching code will end 
up simpler than futzing around with collections.  (The compiler 
itself will need a collection, of course.  But I don't see why the 
runtime lexer would.)

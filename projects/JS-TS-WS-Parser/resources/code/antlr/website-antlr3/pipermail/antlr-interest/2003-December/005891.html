</I>
I browsed around the SLK site a bit and guess SLK *nearly* is able to 
solve the SLL(k) computation in polynomial time instead of exponential. 
As far as I understand it uses the fact SLL(k) computation for any 
*fixed* k is polynomial only. So SLK begins to create a table assuming 
the grammar is SLL(1). If it detects an ambiguity it augments it with 
SLL(2), etc. How does ANTLR do it?

&gt;<i> Again, PCCTS does full LALL(k); my 
</I>&gt;<i> dissertation was how approximate lookahead can be used to attenuate the 
</I>&gt;<i> complexity of computation and storage of lookahead.  This includes

</I>
Yes, but isn't the creation time for such a parser exponential in 
respect to k?

&gt;<i> Let's see if I can come up with an example that PCCTS will accept, but 
</I>&gt;<i> is not SLL(k).  Ok, this grammar is LALL(1) and even approximate 
</I>&gt;<i> LALL(1), meaning even ANTLR 2 will handle it no sweat.  A Strong LL(k)

</I>&gt;<i> a : A;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> t : X a A ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The (a | ) subrule in s needs to see the &quot;local FOLLOW&quot; as B not {A,B} 
</I>&gt;<i> which is the &quot;global FOLLOW&quot; seen by a Strong LL(k) analysis.  Here is

</I>&gt;<i>                          }
</I>&gt;<i>                          case B:
</I>&gt;<i>                          {
</I>&gt;<i>                                  break;
</I>&gt;<i>                          }
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
Ah, this is interesting. *Obviously this shows LALL' grammars are not a 
subset of SLL grammars*!

What about languages then? As far as I understand from the above there 
is always a way to rephrase your LL grammar to SLL to parse any LL 
language, is this correct? Is it always possible to make a LL grammar 
LALL', parsing the same language? If not the LALL' languages indeed seem 
to be a subset of the SLL languages, right?

Cheers :)

Oliver

<PRE>Hi Jim,

&gt;<i> Yesterday we were running a stress test and we got hung in an 
</I>&gt;<i> infinite loop in ASTPair.advanceChildToEnd(). The problem was 
</I>&gt;<i> the NextSibling chain wrapped on itself. When exploring how 
</I>&gt;<i> this happened we discovered that some code had been added to 
</I>&gt;<i> ASTPair since the 2.7.2.1. There is a new static Queue in the 
</I>&gt;<i> class and two static methods GetInstance and PutInstance. The 
</I>&gt;<i> parser generated code now calls GetInstance to create and 
</I>&gt;<i> ASTPair and then calls PutInstance when it is done with it. I 
</I>&gt;<i> am assuming this was done to recycle the ASTPairs and avoid 
</I>&gt;<i> new and garbage collect.
</I>
The intent was to reduce the rate and magnitude of allocations thereby keep
the churn to a minimum.

&gt;<i> Why not just new an ASTPair when required and let the garbage 
</I>&gt;<i> collector clean it up?
</I>
That was the old strategy. It had an often unpleasant cost in memory
usage/churn and overall performance. Especially for larger inputs and
grammars with deep[-ish] rule call depths.

&gt;<i> This is what 2.7.2.1 did. It costs 
</I>&gt;<i> just about nothing to do a &quot;new&quot; in a garbage collected 
</I>&gt;<i> environment (just move the heap pointer) and there is no 
</I>&gt;<i> delete. The only impact is the garbage collect. Rapidly 
</I>&gt;<i> turning over objects get cleanned up very efficiently in the 
</I>&gt;<i> generational .NET garbage collector. Probably less cycles 
</I>&gt;<i> than all the code to enqueue and dequeue the nodes especially 
</I>&gt;<i> if you need critical sections to make it thread safe. A 
</I>&gt;<i> thread static for the queue would work but that is slow too.
</I>
As the input size and rule call depth increases, the resource costs (and
hence performance costs) of those ASTPair instances becomes significant. I'm
thinking we need per-parser object pools. This would stll represent a
significant saving on the pre-2.7.5 unbounded scheme.

&gt;<i> Another option that I tried was to eliminate the Get &amp; Put 
</I>&gt;<i> Instance and change the ASTPair from a class to a struct. 
</I>&gt;<i> This way there is no new on the heap at all. It is a value 
</I>&gt;<i> class on the stack. There are a few other chages required to 
</I>&gt;<i> make this work such as passing the currentAST nodes (ASTPair 
</I>&gt;<i> objects) by ref to addASTChild and makeASTRoot in the 
</I>&gt;<i> ASTFactory. There was also a virtual copy method that didn't 
</I>&gt;<i> seem to be needed.
</I>
Sounds interesting. More detail on what you tried here would be appreciated.

&gt;<i> Can the next patch release can get rid of this problem?
</I>
2.7.6 certainly could have a per-parser object pool.

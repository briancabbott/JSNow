That's yahoo mail--it defaults to html format.

Yeah, you could propagate the message back to the Throwable constructor.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;You can't do that, though--the token types and display formats 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(since ANTLR3 defaults to Objects for tokens) are defined at the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;application level, while the exception classes are library items 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;and know nothing about the application.  The application's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;recognizer(s), though, are subclasses of BaseRecognizer and can 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;know about application features.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That doesn't follow.  The recogniser is what is throwing the 
</I>&gt;<i> exception in the first place.  It should be trivial for it to 
</I>&gt;<i> either pass in the token names directly (in addition to the token 
</I>&gt;<i> ids, which it already does), or to pass in some interface that the 
</I>&gt;<i> exception constructor can call to fetch the token names as 
</I>&gt;<i> needed.  (I prefer the former, but the latter is more extensible 
</I>&gt;<i> and will lead to less API fluctuation.)
</I>
The Java version passes the input stream when creating exceptions, not token information.  I suppose that the critical information could be passed in an object via a &quot;getErrorInfo()&quot; method from BaseRecognizer.  Of course, you would probably need a &quot;getSetDisplay()&quot;, a &quot;getRangeDisplay()&quot; and maybe a few other new methods to add to BaseRecognizer.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Actually, I thought that it was good that you raised the point--I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;just responded that it was not a good solution  at this time, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;since localization is an important factor for (commercial) apps.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see that this hinders localisation much, especially since 
</I>&gt;<i> the GetErrorMessage overridable would still be there, permitting 
</I>&gt;<i> central overriding of all the messages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess it does make finding the specific text that needs 
</I>&gt;<i> translating a little harder, but that's easily mitigated by making 
</I>&gt;<i> the exceptions use a string lookup table rather than hard-coding 
</I>&gt;<i> string constants.  Then the standard strings could be localised 
</I>&gt;<i> simply by updating that table.
</I>
ST is much cleaner for that purpose, just not universal.  Hard coding a set of substrings to be matched and replaced would be error-prone.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;The ANTLR 3 exception management (tool, not runtime) is pretty 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;decent, but the runtime support is still in need of work, largely 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;because the current implementation was designed for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;transportability across target language implementations and Ter 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;could not assume the existence of StringTemplate support when he 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;wrote it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fair enough.  That's a good assumption to hold, even now.  I still 
</I>&gt;<i> don't think that invalidates my point, though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I never said that it did, just that pushing string construction into the exception classes affects localization and should not be done as a quick fix.  Ter's response of adding a bug report was the right response from my perspective--usability issues often require deliberation, and this is certainly a case where there is likely to be a better solution.

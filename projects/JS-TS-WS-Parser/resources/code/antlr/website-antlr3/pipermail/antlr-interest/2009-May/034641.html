</I>&gt;<i> };
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another possibility would be to put the tokens into

</I>&gt;<i> struct LuaParser_Ctx_struct
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i> enum Toneks
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>   FOR = 5,
</I>&gt;<i>    ...
</I>&gt;<i> };
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> };
</I>The problem with enum is that it does not really offer much over #define 
in C and it isn't available on old compilers for embedded systems and so 
on and I want people to be able to the code on just about anything.

The #defines are only used within the context of the include file, and 
in practice all you need do is stick a K in front of any TOKEN name that 
clashes with the system, such as FILE etc. So, make that KFILE and all 
is good.

Basically, all the targets do not attempt to protect you from the target 
itself, so for instance you can't use a parser rule called package in 
the Java target and so on. The problem with doing so is that it is never 
100% correct anyway. Also, when I experimented with this, there was one 
part of the code gen that did not ask the target templates for the token 
name and so it all fell over. That could be fixed I am sure, but in the 
end, I decided that it is better to see the token names without 
obfuscation when debugging the generated C code.

So, basically, what I am saying is that it will be staying as is for the 
foreseeable future ;-)

Jim

You need to understand that a semantic predicate is nothing more than if
IF statement.  Who cares if you do the semantic test before choosing
which sub-rule, or inside the single sub-rule, especially, when both
paths match the *same* input.  In this case, an IDENTIFIER.  But that
doesn't answer question of how do you include your literal tokens in
your identifiers.  I beleive that is where your misunderstanding starts.

&gt;<i> Again, all I'm doing is catching predefined tokens and overriding their
</I>&gt;<i> precedence as reserved keywords, to treat them as identifiers.
</I>
Then the method I proposed below is what you want.

&gt;&gt;<i> in order for isToken to be called, the lookahead would have to *not* be an
</I>&gt;<i> IDENTIFIER.
</I>&gt;<i> My rules were (in a few of my trial &amp; error attempts):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> identifier: isToken(...) | IDENTIFIER;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> isToken:   {...}? IDENTIFIER;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The lookahead can see if isToken is true, it'll be an IDENTIFIER.  But, how
</I>&gt;<i> does it know what's possibly in isToken?  It's an @members function, written
</I>&gt;<i> in the target language, and could be just about anything.  Therefore, I
</I>&gt;<i> would have expected at least some form of the 'identifier' rule to call
</I>&gt;<i> isToken without first forcing IDENTIFIER=true.  Every form I tried autogen'd
</I>&gt;<i> code that required IDENTIFER to be true - BEFORE - it would call isToken.
</I>&gt;<i> That doesn't make sense to me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Only when I explicitly listed all the tokens specifiers in the identifier
</I>&gt;<i> rule did I get autogen'd code that would call isToken (after that
</I>&gt;<i> questionable &quot;if&quot; statement, per below).   What?  Then why not have a
</I>&gt;<i> *function* test for those one-in-the-same values so the grammar file is
</I>&gt;<i> cleaner, not having to list all the tokens *twice* in the grammar file.  I'm
</I>&gt;<i> sure there's a good answer, literal tests vs. a function call.  But,  again,
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR has no idea what code is n that function, so how could it have always
</I>&gt;<i> avoided gen'ing a call to it w/o first requiring IDENTIFER to be true?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In cases like this, I have done:
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you...very much.  I will try that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This question comes up rather often on this list.
</I>&gt;<i> It's easy to find explicit discussion on token specifiers having precedence,
</I>&gt;<i> and how to override them for v2.  But, I didn't find anything for v3, other
</I>&gt;<i> than one could see it's going to be predicate/action-related to resolve. 
</I>
Yes, you'll need to find the correct method to change the token's type
in your parser rule.

&gt;<i> One of  my challenges to finding online help was discussion explicitly
</I>&gt;<i> addressing token specifiers precedence.  And, I wasn't sure what to search
</I>&gt;<i> on (e.g. your solution is not, explicitly, addressing token specifiers.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, for an ANTLR shade-tree mechanic like me, I was left with trial &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> error debugging the autogen'd code and synthesizing predicate/action/other
</I>&gt;<i> stuff into a solution vs. what, I think, should be a quick HOW TO for v3.
</I>&gt;<i> Frustrating, because I knew it was 10lbs. of effort for a 2oz. solution. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your reply is VERY much appreciated.
</I>
Good luck, and let us know how it turns out for you.

</I>&gt;<i> Trober

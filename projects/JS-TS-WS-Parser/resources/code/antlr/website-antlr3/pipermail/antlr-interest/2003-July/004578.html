<PRE>I have personally made no arguments either for or
against LGPL and I use and contribute to software
under this license, complying with its terms to my
best ability based on my understanding of them.  I
will also make no attempt to contradict your assertion
that I am (like others, I'm sure) too lazy to wade
through the &quot;reams of electrons&quot; that constitute these
open-source licenses, preferring to adhere to the
distilled &quot;bottom line&quot; accepted by the community at
large and shared by those with more patience.  I use
open-source software as much as possible (for damned
near everything I suppose); however I limit the ways
in which I use an open-source package to the aspects
of its license I think I understand.  Rest assured
that when an issue arises for which I need a thorough
understanding of &quot;X&quot; license, I will invest the
appropriate neurons.  In the meantime, I feel like my
approach is not as reckless as it could be and I will
not lose sleep over your (fairly on-target)
accusations because my comfort is worth more to me
than your approval, ya know?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Wow.  That was rough.  Personally, I'm not the
</I>&gt;<i> least
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bit ashamed to admit having difficulty in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understanding the dizzying wording of the various
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; open-source licenses.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That reflects the unfortunate fact that, &quot;I'm a
</I>&gt;<i> techie; I shouldn't be 
</I>&gt;<i> expected to understand a legal document,&quot; has become
</I>&gt;<i> an accepted means of 
</I>&gt;<i> evading the chore of dealing with and understanding
</I>&gt;<i> the issues of policy that 
</I>&gt;<i> are an inevitable consequence of writing code. In
</I>&gt;<i> general, such documents are 
</I>&gt;<i> written to be understandable and unambiguous--with
</I>&gt;<i> the unfortunate side effect 
</I>&gt;<i> of making them verbose and tedious to read.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a matter of fact, there are plenty of software
</I>&gt;<i> engineers working at 
</I>&gt;<i> software companies who routinely and confidently use
</I>&gt;<i> and depend on LGPL 
</I>&gt;<i> software. Assertions to the contrary exhibit
</I>&gt;<i> ignorance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am not trying to promote the LGPL for use with a
</I>&gt;<i> future version of ANTLR. In 
</I>&gt;<i> fact, as long as my ability to continue to use ANTLR
</I>&gt;<i> output with my LGPL 
</I>&gt;<i> software is not threatened--and I do not anticipate
</I>&gt;<i> that it will be--I have no 
</I>&gt;<i> opinion on the matter. However, just about every
</I>&gt;<i> message posted decrying the 
</I>&gt;<i> potential application of the LGPL to ANTLR has
</I>&gt;<i> included varying amounts of 
</I>&gt;<i> inaccuracy, much of which has obviously been FUD
</I>&gt;<i> repeated n-hand. As someone 
</I>&gt;<i> who develops LGPL software, I may be inclined to
</I>&gt;<i> respond harshly to gross 
</I>&gt;<i> inaccuracies resulting from what I perceive as
</I>&gt;<i> in-your-face intellectual 
</I>&gt;<i> laziness.

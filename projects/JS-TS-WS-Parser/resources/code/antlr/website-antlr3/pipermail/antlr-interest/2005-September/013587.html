Hi Oliver,

Yep, I was opposed to creating that memory on each invocation, but  
now that I think about it, it would be not that bad for parsers as  
cyclic DFAs are uncommon.  However, the lexer would get crushed.  Can  
u imagine creating and extra object for every token?

There was a reason that I simply didn't pass in the &quot;this&quot; pointer as  
a parameter.  can't remember why.  Maybe it was because I couldn't  
see inside the code and figure out what variables had to have &quot;this.&quot;  
prepended.  There was some really good reason I didn't do this.   
Sorry I can't remember.  Maybe my code has a comment...

Ter

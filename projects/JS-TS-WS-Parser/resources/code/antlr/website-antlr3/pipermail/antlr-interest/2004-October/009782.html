Yep, and Stratego.  Here is the program / papers:

<A HREF="http://www.ii.uib.no/~magne/stsw04-html-2/">http://www.ii.uib.no/~magne/stsw04-html-2/</A>

&gt;<i> I had looked at a few of these when I was first starting on my

heh, that jazillian is cool.  You should add to the showcase:

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/showcase/list">http://www.antlr.org/showcase/list</A>

&gt;<i> that you had about &quot;big, closed systems&quot; vs. &quot;small tools to

</I>
yeah, 100M download is definitely an inverted view from the 
programmers'.

&gt;<i>  I wasn't convinced that

</I>
you should definitely link to this perhaps directly in the articles 
section of the website too. :)

&gt;<i> I'm also curious...if you got a flavor for what each of these

</I>
Ack...none of us could understand each others' tools ;)  Most of them 
are hypercomplicated beasts.  I hesitate to say what is useful and what 
is not.

I'm going to start a rewriting &quot;blog&quot; this morning to capture some 
thoughts about what I'd like in terms of a practical rewrite system 
that would be like sed/awk except it paid attention to syntax not just 
reg exprs. :)  I'll post something and let people know.

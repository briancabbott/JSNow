<PRE>I have developed a custom markup language (CML not XML, like
XML) parser on .NET platform. I had no problem choosing ANTLR (a
parser generator written in Java) to generate C# parser. 

ANTLR C# runtime source code is included in project's .NET build
to make managed DLLs.

The argument that build environment has Java dependency looks weak
to me specially if there is a strong need to build an automated parser
on .NET platform. I would not worry about porting ANTLR parser
generator from Java to .NET -- I guess there are better things
to improve in ANTLR. ANTLR C# runtime might need change (I recently
proposed on change related to globalization) as ANTLR progresses.
This architecture covers both platform with minimum effort.

</I>Mike, I'd
&gt;<i> be curious to know if your situation is similar.

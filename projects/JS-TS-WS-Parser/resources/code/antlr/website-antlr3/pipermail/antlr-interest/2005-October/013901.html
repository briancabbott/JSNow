<PRE>Please note that this is not the final antlrstudio site. It is currently
meant only for people who would like to try out a pre release version of AS.
As such it contains very little information and handholding. Its really just
a bunch of html files which i manually update with hand to announce the
release of videos and betas.

The new web site which i am currently designing, which will be up on the day
of the final release, will have all the information that you possibly need
to understand and get started with ANTLR Studio :)

</I>&gt;<i> to know what is needed to run your plug in? Is the SDK enough? Do I need the
</I>&gt;<i> Java Development tools or the Plugin Environment or the Platform? How about
</I>&gt;<i> the Visual Editor?
</I>&gt;<i>  And if you go to Sun's site, there's links to all sorts of things named
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;java&quot; this and &quot;java&quot; that. There's &quot;Java 2 Standard Edition&quot; on the
</I>&gt;<i> downloads page, and there's links to J2SE 5.0, J2SE 1.4.2 and J2SE 1.3.1.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see any &quot;JVM 1.5&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>  One of your earlier posts today started out: &quot;As you guys already know,
</I>&gt;<i> if you try using AS(ANTLR Studio) with AE(ANTLR Eclipse)...&quot; No, not of us
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;already know&quot;. That's the point I was trying to make in my original post.
</I>&gt;<i> If you're only focused on those who already know Java and Eclipse, that's
</I>&gt;<i> fine. Maybe that's covers most of the Antlr community, but you shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> assume that everyone already knows about any particular platform, language
</I>&gt;<i> or development environment.
</I>&gt;<i>  A short &quot;here's how to get started on a Windows machine without Java&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> document would be a great help. I'd invest the time to look at Antlr Studio
</I>&gt;<i> if I knew exactly what to install to get up and running with a minimum of
</I>&gt;<i> fuss. But I don't have time to go digging around Sun's site or figuring out
</I>&gt;<i> what parts of Eclipse I need to install. Like most developers, I've got too
</I>&gt;<i> much work to get done and too few hours in the day to do it &lt;g&gt;.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Don,
</I>&gt;<i> Actually the videos make it quite clear that it is for eclipse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And you can use it for C++, although debugging wont work in such a case.
</I>&gt;<i> But you can easily use the grammar editor to type your antlr grammar and
</I>&gt;<i> put c++ code inside the actions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To run AS, you need to download JVM 1.5 from Sun's site and Eclipse 3.1from
</I>&gt;<i> eclipse.org &lt;<A HREF="http://eclipse.org">http://eclipse.org</A>&gt; :)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  This may not be the kind of feedback you were looking for, so take it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for whatever it's worth.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I'm a Windows, C++ guy. I spend most of my life inside Visual Studio,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and I don't know anything about Java or Eclipse. I have plenty of C++ work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and precious little spare time, so I really have no desire to tinker with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Java or Eclipse. It's hard enough to find time to cut the grass.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I go to your web site in anticipation of downloading an IDE for Antlr.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nice screen shots, looks really interesting. .But nowhere does it say that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this is a plug-in for some other IDE, at least nowhere that was obvious to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me. I eventually figure that out and do a Google search for Eclipse. Now I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; faced with a large array of things to download. Do I just need the Eclipse
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SDK, or do I need any of the other stuff?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Then I notice that you need Java to run Eclipse. Great. Now I'm faced
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the prospect of downloading three things from three different sources,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hoping I choose the right downloads and that I install them in the proper
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; order, and hoping that they'll all play nice and work together. And more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; important, I have to hope that installing all this stuff doesn't somehow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hose up my development machine.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Faced with the prospect of wasting many hours trying to get all of this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to work vs., getting back to the mountain of work I have to do, I close
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my browser and get back to work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Now, I realize that your target audience is probably Java people and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; installing Java and Eclipse might be as simple to you guys as installing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Visual Studio is to me. If there was some assurance that this stuff is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fairly painless to install and get running, I'd take a look at Antlr Studio
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and most likely, purchase a copy, as long as it can work with Antlr's C++
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; generated parsers. No interest in creating or debugging Java-based parsers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; C# would be a plus, but C++ is a must.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I looked for some hand-holding article on your web site, but didn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; find anything at all that would help a Java/Eclipse-challenged programmer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; such as myself. Maybe most of the people in the Antlr world are Java people,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so I realize that this might not be worth your time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  My 2 cents, hope its useful.

<PRE>If you want to try it out then you will be able to download the snapshot release of the ANTLR tool later today, once I upgrade Hudson so that it builds it again. The runtime has not changed, just the templates.

Jim, 
    I read about the initialization rules and i agree with them. Thanks for fixing it so quickly. 

Gokul.

Assigning it to 0, will again cause trouble for C++ folks.


No it won't, because 0 is a valid (indeed, the preferred) way of writing
a null pointer constant in C++.



I think you misunderstood me. I said assigning 0 to a enum in C++ will throw a compiler error. 
 
I didn't though :). See email about new initialization rules. I think that they are much mire in keeping with C and C++. More generally it makes the grammar programmer responsible for behaviour, which is in line with the rest of the C stuff.

David's point about C++ is correct though 0 == NULL is guranteed in ANSI C, evenbthough rhe compiler must work it out. Better to use NULL consistently and try to avoid adding to the billion dollars.

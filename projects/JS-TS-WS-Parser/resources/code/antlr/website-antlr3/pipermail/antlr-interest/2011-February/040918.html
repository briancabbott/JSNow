<PRE>I was in the process of buying Terences's books from The Pragmaic Bookshelp
when I found the 40% discount.

I don't know if anyone can do this, or they have to an existing customer.

If someone else is interested in the 40% discount, please let me know and we
can both benefit.
Either way I will by buying them by Monday evening.

Thanks
</PRE>

<PRE>Hi,



I wrote a post yesterday about the trouble I'm having getting started with ANTLR. Overnight, I thought about it some more, and I'm becoming convinced that the latest problems I'm having are either problems with the Csharp target or backwards compatibility problems between ANTRL example code and the CSharp target. I have now purchase &quot;the definitive guide&quot;, and I can work through examples using the Java based tools. But I do need the generated code to ultimately be in C# and to work.



If the Csharp target are actively developed and &quot;supported&quot; here, then I can use ANTLR for my project(s) and spread the technology around my workplace. Otherwise, I'll have to go back building simpler parser by hand :-( I sure hope that that is not the case.



I'm willing to contribute to shaking down the target, contributing and cleaning up example code, and write installation help for newbies.



- Andy

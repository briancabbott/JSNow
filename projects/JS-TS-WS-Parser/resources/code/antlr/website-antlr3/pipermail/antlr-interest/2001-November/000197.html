Yes i agree a central Logging facility would be better for the ANTLR Tool and

for IDE Intergration like JBuilder etc.
But for a small Runtime and under the Aspect that there is only one runtime
class (ASTFactory)
which use this Logging only for a warning it would be nice to get rid of this
dependicy
Perhaps it might be even better to change this to throwing a
new RuntimeException like ASTGenerationException !?

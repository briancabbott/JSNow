<PRE>Hi Tom,

Tom,

Thanks for the very impressive notes.  There are linked to from &quot;antlr 
2 bashing page&quot; and here is a direct link:

A few comments enclosed.

&gt;<i> Follow set caching
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------
</I>&gt;<i> There are problems analyzing expressions of the form:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> rule: (A1|B1) {A2|B2) ... (A25|B25)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> because follow sets are cached only for rules.  In this case 2**25
</I>&gt;<i> alternative would need to be computed.  However, if each subrule
</I>&gt;<i> had its follow set cached, it would require only 50 evaluations.
</I>
The new NFA to DFA conversion will not simulate the NFA to compute a 
finite, acyclic DFA (i.e., lookahead tree).  It will compute a possibly 
cyclic DFA.  Now, lookahead computation will not be a function of k!  
It will be a function of the number of states. :)

&gt;<i> There are two kinds of semantic predicates needed.  One kind is used
</I>&gt;<i> to creat a &quot;virtual token&quot; which combines token information with a
</I>&gt;<i> semantic test.  This is the classic C typename test.  The other kind
</I>&gt;<i> of semantic predicate is used to control flow and does not depend on
</I>&gt;<i> context.  In short, type 1 semantic predicate always depend onOB
</I>&gt;<i> lookahead while type 2 semantic predicate never depend on lookahead.
</I>
Can't you just define a predicate that doesn't reference lookahead?  Is 
that what you mean?  Can you give me an example?

&gt;<i> Support for Unicode up to at least 0x10ffff (current xml range).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tolerance for binary zero would be desirable.  After all, flex
</I>&gt;<i> can do it.
</I>
I have an example that matches binary stuff :)  The UNICODE works up to 
0xFFFFE :)

&gt;<i> Consider the following rule:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     r1: A ( B | epsilon )* C ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> with input:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     A C
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In pccts this results in an ambiguity warning because it can't decide
</I>&gt;<i> whether whether to enter the epsilon branch or bypass the entire
</I>&gt;<i> subrule.  When there is no action in the epsilon alternative antlr3
</I>&gt;<i> should allow it and handle it in the &quot;natural&quot; way - bypassing
</I>&gt;<i> the subrule
</I>
I'm not sure I can agree...you have provided two ways to match the same 
input: an ambiguity by definition, right?  On the other hand, are you 
saying for action processing this is very desirable?  For example,

(A | B)*

matches the same thing as

(A | B | {foo} )*

but {foo} is executed as it exits or if nothing is matched?

&gt;<i>  |   call       : (&quot;@&quot; ID)? &amp;&amp; &lt;&lt;isVarName(LT(2))&gt;&gt;? fun_call          
</I>&gt;<i>     |
</I>&gt;<i>  |              | (ID)?     &amp;&amp; &lt;&lt;isExtCmdName&gt;&gt;?     command           
</I>&gt;<i>     |
</I>&gt;<i>  |              | (ID &quot;(&quot;)?                          fun_call          
</I>&gt;<i>     |
</I>&gt;<i>  |              |                                    command           
</I>&gt;<i>     |
</I>&gt;<i>  |              ;                                                      
</I>&gt;<i>     |
</I>
How does isExtCmdName test the input symbol?  Is it a variable?  If so, 
where is it set?

I'm hoping to &quot;hoist &gt; 0 lookahead distance&quot; with the combined NFA-&gt;DFA 
conversion + collect predicts.  I'll run this past you when I figure it 
out ;)

&gt;<i> The volume of memory required for bit sets grows as N**2 because the
</I>&gt;<i> number of terminals tends to grow as N and the number of tests grows
</I>&gt;<i> as N.  For very large grammars this is a bit of an annoyance (pun).
</I>&gt;<i> You might consider a technique which would try for greater locality of
</I>&gt;<i> bit sets so that it for non-pathological cases it would be N**1.5 or
</I>&gt;<i> N*log(N).  An alternative would be run-length encoding for sparse
</I>&gt;<i> bit sets.  The bits sets could be expanded at startup time.
</I>&gt;<i> I believe JFlex uses this.
</I>
I think that a simple initial offset like &quot;my first non-zero bit is n&quot; 
will lop off a big chunk off the front and still provide equally fast 
access at analysis and parse-time with no uncompression.  Not sure, but 
should help.  I'm definitely a bit concerned with the size of the 
bitsets needed to build DFAs from a large grammar.  Could end up with 
30,000 states for a big grammar.  I note that there are 4515 words in 
the java.g file.  Each word will result in perhaps 3 or 4 states.

Note that I stop the DFA conversion the instant an alternative is 
uniquely predicted.  Even if sets are very big, I won't be computing 
that many of them.  For degenerate cases like

a : A Q R S | B X Y Z ;

The DFA would be simply three states:

o -A-&gt; o predict alt 1
|<i>
</I>|<i> -B-&gt; o predict alt 2
</I>
I won't even consider the Q or X or beyond.  Slick, eh?

Now, UNICODE in the lexer could be an issue, but again, I don't build a 
DFA for entire lexer grammar, just for the left edges for prediction. 
:<i>)
</I>
Concerning exceptions for code gen.  I agree that try/catch is the 
easiest to use as I want to use exceptions for error handling.  What 
would we do for C?  I'd resist the longjmp this time probably ;)

&gt;<i> Set Difference
</I>&gt;<i> --------------
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any way to say: this token matches all the tokens *not* in
</I>&gt;<i> the FIRST set of some other alternative or not in the union of the
</I>&gt;<i> FIRST sets of some other alternatives ?
</I>
Do you mean like

( x
|<i> y
</I>|<i> .
</I>)

This means match not x and not y.  It removes the lookhead from '.' 
from previous alts...this is an &quot;idiom&quot; i guess.  Are you suggesting 
something more formal?

Thanks again for the thoughts.

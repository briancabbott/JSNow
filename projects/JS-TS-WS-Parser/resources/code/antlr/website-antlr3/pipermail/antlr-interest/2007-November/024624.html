<PRE>&quot;When addressing a student, learn, and do not assume, their needs.&quot;
  - One of &quot;Rules To Teach By&quot; ;)

Ok, I get it now. Each of these techniques produces the same result: one 
node, one token, the fully-qualified identifier text (if desired). 
However, they differ in what it takes to match the identifier.

If the fully-qualified identifier can be matched with the lexer than the 
lexical solution is fine-'n-dandy.

If you need the parser to match it, then you can use the tree 
rule-rewrite grammar to define the node as a previously named token with 
the matched text in whatever coded manner you like (which is what you 
meant by &quot;rewrite the rule as the imaginary token&quot;). That would make 
this solution, uhm, Jim-dandy. &lt;chuckle&gt;

Thx for the clarification.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, you are parsing the elements of some complicated reference or 
</I>&gt;<i> variable or class etc, and you need '.' in other places in your parser, 
</I>&gt;<i> and you also need to look at the individual pieces of the id. When you 
</I>&gt;<i> send the reference to the tree parser, you want to tag it with something 
</I>&gt;<i> to introduce it as a reference. Hence you would usually use an imaginary 
</I>&gt;<i> token as the place holder for the reference and have it introduce the 
</I>&gt;<i> individual pieces of the reference, which can then be looked up to find 
</I>&gt;<i> out if they are enumerations, objects and so on, such that the tree 
</I>&gt;<i> parser deals with them accordingly. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you pass the whole thing in as one token from the lexer, then you 
</I>&gt;<i> will probably end up splitting the token text anyway, so you can look up 
</I>&gt;<i> the context. However, if you never need to do this, then a lexical 
</I>&gt;<i> solution probably does work for you. Trying to apply context within the 
</I>&gt;<i> lexer rules though is definitely not something you should be doing by 
</I>&gt;<i> choice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now keep in mind that there are always 18 ways to skin a cat, and that's 
</I>&gt;<i> just the way I do such things, it's whatever floats your boat in the end 
</I>&gt;<i> :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Check the wiki or book for the rewrite syntax, but you can set the text 
</I>&gt;<i> of a token when you rewrite it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, your options are:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Lexical if there is no need to do anything with the different 
</I>&gt;<i> components (maybe you are formatting and dont need to know what it is 
</I>&gt;<i> for instance).
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Declare a local String variable and as you get each ID text, append 
</I>&gt;<i> it, then rewrite with that as the token text (here this would be so that 
</I>&gt;<i> you have simpler lexer rules or are avoiding some lexing ambiguity say, 
</I>&gt;<i> because putting the text back together is kind of redundant (I seem to 
</I>&gt;<i> think that this was why the first question received the answer it did);
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Rewrite the place holding imaginary token and each of the name 
</I>&gt;<i> components. If you can work out the type or context at this stage in the 
</I>&gt;<i> parse, then you might write one of a number of imaginaries, but If you 
</I>&gt;<i> have to parser the whole thing before you can work out types, then you 
</I>&gt;<i> would use one token and resolve the types in the next phase.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So:
</I>&gt;<i> tokens
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i> 	REFERENCE;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> id:
</I>&gt;<i>    i=ID (DOT i+=ID) -&gt; ^(REFERENCE $i+)
</I>&gt;<i> ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or perhaps, if you have context, something like
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> id:
</I>&gt;<i>    v=ID (DOT r+=ID)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	-&gt; {lookup($v) == OBJECT}? ^(OBJECT $v $r*)
</I>&gt;<i> 	-&gt; and so on
</I>&gt;<i>

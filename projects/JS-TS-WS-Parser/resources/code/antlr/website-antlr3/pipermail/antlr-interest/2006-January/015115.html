</I>&gt;<i>

The non-termination of rule-based algorithms is fairly well established,
particularly if you are applying back-tracking or goal-searching.

Pick up a book on language design and check out the description of Prolog -
particular combinations of rules and facts in particular orders will not
terminate. E.g. Ghezzi and Jazayeri &quot;Programming Language Concepts&quot; 1987 p
304 states &quot;Both the order in which facts and rules are listed ... and the
order in which subgoals are listed are significant. There are programs that
behaviour correctly ... but enter an infinite loop or generate a run-time
error if the order changes&quot;.

So the order that you apply the rules and the size of the rule-set will
affect the efficiency of the algorithm and whether it terminates. If you are
applying those rules sequentially, and they are not cyclical, then you might
be okay as long as you have a good idea of when to terminate the rule
search. Prolog has the &quot;cut&quot; operator to limit back-tracking and increase
efficiency. Sebesta &quot;Concepts of programming languages&quot; 1999 p 629 has a
good example of infinite recursion in Prolog.

It seems that Andy's approach gives more granularity of control over
particular pattern matching and manipulation - things that would have to be
coded as an action in an ANTLR tree-walker. However, the disadvantage is
that it requires somebody to write such a rule engine to process the 200 or
so rules that you have written. It does sound like it would be more
intuitive to write these rules in certain circumstances, depending on what
patterns were acceptable.

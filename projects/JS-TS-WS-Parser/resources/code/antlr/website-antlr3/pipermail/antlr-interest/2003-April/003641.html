No match would imply that syntactic predicates would not work anymore.
Often match calls look redundant in generated code since just before it the
node is checked in a case. In some situations this will not be the case
thus blowing things up. Also the match code contains the checks for the
null pointer sentries, which is another can of worms altogether.

It kindoff sounds like you want an unfolding for every possible tree
traversal ? Which would not be practical for the general case. For some
subclass of grammars it might be ok.

&gt;<i> &gt; See the tinybasic.g example for ideas on how to do an interpreter.
</I>&gt;<i> I had a short look at it, but I think it suffers (in terms of

</I>&gt;<i> for the next sibling, even all this information could be delivered

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> EG: A switch statement.
</I>&gt;<i> The first node would contain the number N of case entries
</I>&gt;<i> so the type (=function to call) is already known for the next
</I>&gt;<i> N siblings.
</I>
&gt;<i> Are there any plans in this direction?
</I>
No.

&gt;<i> Where are the crucial lines in the java code?
</I>
CppCodegenerator.java and all the lines involving generating 'match' calls.

If you know what you are doing and understand the grammar you have very
well (and it doesn't use syntactic predicates) you may get away by using a
hacked codegenerator. YMMV. 

Cheers,

Ric

 Why don't we just invite them to dinner and massacre them all when they're
  drunk? You heard the man. There's seven hundred thousand of them. Ah? ..
           So it'd have to be something simple with pasta, then.

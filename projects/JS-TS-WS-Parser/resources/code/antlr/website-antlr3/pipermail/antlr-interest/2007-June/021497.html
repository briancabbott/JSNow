<PRE>As Jim points out, this has been debated before. 
Basically the two sides are those who favor an
ergonomic solution (reply to author and _not_ to the
list is a rare occurrence) and those with the
religious conviction that &quot;because it is written&quot;
reply to's should go directly to the poster.

Error prone solutions are not good design practice.  I
find it difficult to understand the original opinion
statement on reply to munging is taken at all
seriously.  After all, if we apply the same principles
to software development, all programs should be
written in machine code so that minimal munging is
required before the logic is interpreted by the
computer.  Somehow, I find that argument less than
compelling.

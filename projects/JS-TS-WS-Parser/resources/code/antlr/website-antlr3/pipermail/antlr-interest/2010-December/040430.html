<PRE>Hello,

 

I have some concerns with the generated parser C code when using @after
and/or finally blocks in conjunction with backtracking. In my parser,
for every line matched in a program, I have to create a new instance of
a C++ class. This instance is in the scope of the &quot;line&quot; rule, and is
used by the actions of this rule and all of the nested rules that it
calls. To accomplish this, I added an @init section to create the new
instance. I was not sure if I should use @after or finally to do the
cleanup, so I initially tried using both. See the attached Test.g for a
simplified example. What I found was that with backtracking turned off,
what I wanted was the finally block, and it would always free the
allocated memory. Unfortunately, I am stuck with backtrack=true (at
least for now), and it appears to me that the generated code will not
clean up memory properly in all cases. As you can see in the attached
TestParser.c, there are two cases in the line() function where there is
a &quot;return;&quot; line that does not execute the cleanup code from the @after
or finally blocks. I am not sure how likely it is for these cases to
occur, but it is clear to me that there is a potential for memory leaks
in the generated code.

 

The next thing I tried was to move my allocation/deallocation code up
one level, into the actions of the &quot;prog&quot; rule. This is probably a
better choice because the memory will not be allocated when
backtracking. See the attached Test2.g for my simplified implementation.
This generated code (see attached Test2Parser.c) looks better, but there
is still the potential for a memory leak. Looking at the prog()
function, the memory is only allocated if BACKTRACKING == 0, and then
the line() rule function is called. After it returns from line(), if
HASEXCEPTION() is true, the cleanup is handled by the finally block
case. However, if HASFAILED() returns true (and HASEXCEPTION() returns
false), then there is again a direct &quot;return;&quot; that does not do memory
cleanup. I am beginning to think that maybe this is an impossible
condition (does HASFAILED() only get set when backtracking?), but it is
unclear to me.

 

I am hoping that you will tell me that the memory leak in the second
case is an impossible condition, and then I can move on with that
implementation. If that is not the case, is there some sort or
workaround that I can do? Regardless of that, it seems like the first
implementation should also be valid, and maybe the generated code could
handle that better.

 

I know that the real solution is to left-factor the grammar and not use
backtracking, but the syntax is inherently flawed and ambiguous, and we
are not allowed to break back compatibility. While it may be possible, I
am probably not skilled enough to figure it out in the allotted
timeframe. The good news is that even with backtracking and memoizing,
the ANTLR parser performs 25% faster than what it replaced (Visual
Parse++, an ancient and horrible parser generator).

 

Thanks again,

<PRE>Hi,

</I>
This was also my first implementation. There were problems with it exact
circumstances I'd have to look up. But it went wrong somewhere. Of course
this may depend a bit on actual implementations YMMV etc. In general it
doesn't make sense to copy the down/right pointers since they will point
into another tree. And doing a recursive copy is probably also not what you
want (in the general case).

&gt;<i> As for going through a create(), we are cloning an instance rather
</I>&gt;<i> than creating one right....
</I>
This is also a bit more my feel about it. It may be that this is a 'taste'
question. So far I don't really feel like routing the C++ clone's through
the initialize stuff. In general in C++ doing clone's via copy constructors
is the right-thing (tm), so I'll go with what a C++ user expects from these
beasts. We'll probably see more digression between C++ and Java in the
future anyway.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Gotta be consistent I'd say. Make sense?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hmmm C++ mode does not go through create for the dups but does straight
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clones. Consistency is a point yes. Then again I don't really like the dups
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the factory. I'll have a look one of these days.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cloning-by-copy-construction ensures that the semantics of cloning
</I>&gt;<i> (specified in the copy constructor chain) are separated from the
</I>&gt;<i> semantics of initialization (specified in initialize() methods) --
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. clone() wouldn't normally copy any AST node pointers (including
</I>&gt;<i> down/right) to avoid aliasing issues with tree parser transformations
</I>&gt;<i> but initialize() might normally copy such nodes (but not down/right).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The semi-deep cloning semantics of dupXXX() are trouble enough to be

</I>
I'm thinking of putting them into the antlr namespace as normal functions.
They're not really factory things.

Cheers,

Ric

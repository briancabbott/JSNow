 &gt;On any mail client I've used I don't get

the TO)...

The ANTLR list is doing the &quot;right thing&quot; by not changing the 
Reply-To header.  This means that in most email clients hitting 
the Reply button will send a private message to the author, and 
Reply All a public one to the author AND to the list (and possibly 
also to some of the authors of previous messages in the 
thread).  This is a Good Thing, since it allows choice.

All people need to remember is that Reply is private and Reply All 
is public.  Simple.  (As long as the list doesn't evilly 
manipulate the Reply-To header, anyway.)

What'd be nice is if the mailing list software were smart enough 
to recognise private member addresses in the To line and avoid 
sending them an additional copy as part of the list mailout.  But 
I don't think that's currently an option, so you should bug 
Mailman about it, not Ter ;)

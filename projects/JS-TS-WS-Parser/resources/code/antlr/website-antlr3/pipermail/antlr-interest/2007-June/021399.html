Well, if it's anything like that abomination of an email client produced 
by Microsoft, I'd probably shoot various components of my computer 
after using it for about five minutes.

But I have used VisualStudio a little several years ago, and yes, it was 
to do C++. Of all the IDEs I've used, it caused me fewer headaches than 
most.

I don't know who Whole Tomato is or what Visual Assist X does. Based 
their Web site, it looks a lot like IDEA's built-in refactorings and 
assists or those of some of its add-ons such as Refactor-J. $150 seems 
a bit expensive for this, however.

<PRE>I did not say that it is not all Microsoft's fault. Indeed, it is.
But under current agreement, which they were force to sing as a 
penalty, Microsoft can not develop the product (regardless it is J++ 
or J#) any further than version 1.1.4. Which means thay can not even 
do reverse engineering and implement functionality found in new 
versions. Some other company could, but not Microsoft.

&gt;<i> had passed the compatibility tests it would have been fine to ship. 
</I>But
&gt;<i> MS chose to drop the product, rather than fix those places where it

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The whole point of the Sun lawsuit was that MS had licenced Sun 
</I>code,
&gt;<i> and was using the Java trademark, and contrary to the terms of the
</I>&gt;<i> contract was shipping a product that failed the compatibility 
</I>tests. If
&gt;<i> MS had fixed the compatibility problem they would have been allowed 
</I>to
&gt;<i> continue shipping updated JVMs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All that agreement says is that MS could continue to sell their 
</I>existing
&gt;<i> 1.1.4 JVM. It also prevents them shipping an improved product that 
</I>is in
&gt;<i> breach of the original contract. If MS had chosen to abide by the
</I>&gt;<i> contract then they could have shipped an updated JVM! THAT is why I 
</I>said
&gt;<i> they were behaving like spoilt brats - they broke their side of the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, you are right. It can be compatible but ... they (MS) would 
</I>&gt;<i> need a new license for it. Current license does not allow them to 
</I>go 
&gt;<i> beyond version 1.1.4 (<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/pr/2001/01/pr010123-">http://java.sun.com/pr/2001/01/pr010123-</A>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think MS is just afraid that if they continue to develop new 
</I>&gt;<i> versions compatible with new &quot;official&quot; versions Sun could try to 
</I>&gt;<i> prove in court that this is still Java but named J#. (J++ was not 
</I>&gt;<i> named Java too). And they would probably win.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course MS could get a new license but I am not sure they 
</I>actually 
&gt;<i> could. And right now, I am sure, they do not want to.
</I>&gt;<i> Remember, whatever they say this is primary about business and 
</I>&gt;<i> competition.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MS is acting like a spoilt brat
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I think it is kind of new Sun's point of view, when they want

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As far as I know, there is ABSOLUTELY NO BARRIER to MS including

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like a spoilt brat, and that Sun got an injunction saying that MS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; couldn't call it &quot;Java&quot; unless it could pass the Java-

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I was also able to use J# to generate Tool.exe file for .NET
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; As Tom mentioned, there was only one change needed, which it 
</I>&gt;<i> seems 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Microsoft
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; team missed from their java library implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; They did not forget. This is a legal issue. J# can be Java 
</I>&gt;<i> compatible 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; up to version 1.1.4 while File.getParentFile() was introduced in 
</I>&gt;<i> jdk 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.2.

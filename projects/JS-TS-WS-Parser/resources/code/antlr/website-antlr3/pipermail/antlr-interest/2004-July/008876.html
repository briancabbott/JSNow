<PRE>Hi Monty,

Yes, they are parser rules. &quot; I would profile and determine if any
particular rules have performance issues 
and if so I would refactor rules&quot; -- How do you profile your rules? This is
the first time I'm writing a compiler; Once it is done, there are probably
many ways to test its efficiency as a whole. But how can you profile the
structure of individual rules? Can you give me some pointers?

For now, I'm building two versions of the compiler side-by-side. One with
syntactic predicates for clarity and another without it. I'm planning to run
large code files on both and see how well they respond. 

Thanks,

Bharath.

By having rules with capital letters I'm assuming these are lexer 
rules, however your text indicates that they are actually parser rules. 
  Would you please clarify which they are?

I would go for clarity and use the syntactic predicates.  Then I would 
profile and determine if any particular rules have performance issues 
and if so I would refactor rules.  I believe you will find that 
improving your lexer will give you a bigger payoff than tweaking the 
parser, but of course you never really know until you gather 
performance data.

<PRE>Scott,

&gt;<i> 4) You're thinking of a single-pass *program*, which seems to 
</I>&gt;<i> be the same box Ter is thinking in. (This is for all of your 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;the garbage collector is reasonably optimized&quot; lines. I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> talking about scenarios where the garbage collector will run 
</I>&gt;<i> hundreds or more times while the program is running)
</I>
Regardless of how often the GC runs, Loring's statement regarding GC
performance (and the effect that having Carriers has on it) remains
relevant. 

The &quot;overhead of carriers&quot; as you put it is similar between the current
Carrier/Payload model and any other tree representation you propose that
also separates navigation and data. It's worth remembering that Carrier and
Payload are abstractions (i.e. interfaces).

&gt;<i> There's no way I'd propose making eclipse ASTs implement 
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR's AST interface. I'd be laughed out of the mailing 
</I>&gt;<i> list, because everyone there knows adapters are the right 
</I>&gt;<i> approach, and that this is only feasible if ANTLR trees work 
</I>&gt;<i> the same way Swing trees do.
</I>
Adapters are NOT *always* the right approach as you seem to be suggesting
but, in the particular case of ANTLR trees, it can be argued that the use of
a TreeModel-like tree abstraction is a better option that 2.x's AST
interface (or 3.x's Carrier interface). This is because it allows ANTLR to
be used with [almost] any tree representation. And it supports ANTLR v3's
Carrier/Payload model very capably. And I've yet to see any performance
demons...

&gt;<i> Ter -- please look at the example I posted. I hope you &quot;get 
</I>&gt;<i> it&quot; and implement this for 3.0. Otherwise I'll need to 
</I>&gt;<i> maintain a mod to ANTLR that I'd really rather not.
</I>
As I mentioned in another message, this can probably be implemented as an
alternative codegen template in v3 but, ANTLR v3 would be much better if it
were a part of the standard package. We did something similar with a v2.x
fork and for our use cases there were no adverse performance issues.

&gt;<i> This is no extra cost to ANTLR or use of ANTLR ASTs, but it 
</I>&gt;<i> opens up ANTLR a whole new realm of application.
</I>
Actually there is a cost as it involves at least an extra level of
indirection on each access. True, it's a minor cost in most cases but, it
exists nonetheless. I'd argue however that the benefits to ANTLR and it's
users of this flexibility outweigh the cost.

Cheers,

Micheal

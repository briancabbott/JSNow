<PRE>&lt;&lt;I'm surprised by the speed difference though. I might have to rethink my
filter; that is, which stream it uses.&gt;&gt;
My test case which I execute 1,000,000 times:  ((2*3*4)/(2*3*4)+10*(5+5))*.5

Execution time Using *BufferedTreeNodeStream* is *5855 ms*.
                CommonTree commonTree=(CommonTree)ast.getTree();
                TreeNodeStream nodes=new BufferedTreeNodeStream(commonTree);
                TreeParser walker=new MyTreeParser(nodes);

Execution time Using *CommonTreeNodeStream* is *17387* *ms*.
                CommonTree commonTree=(CommonTree)ast.getTree();
                TreeNodeStream nodes=new CommonTreeNodeStream(commonTree);
                TreeParser walker=new MyTreeParser(nodes);

The performance difference would vary based on how many times you execute
the case.  My application executes code like this a lot, so I used a high
numbered test case.

Calling reset on both BufferedTreeNodeStream and CommonTreeNodeStream both
work properly for my code.   If I call TreeParser.reset() the subsquent
calls give me the following message:  MyTreeParser.g: node from line 0:0 no
viable alternative at input 'EOF'

What method should I call to allow me to keep looping the TreeParser?
Calling it on the NodeStreams seem to work, but I don't know if that is the
preferred approach.  Also, is there a reason reset() isn't defined on either
TreeNodeStream or IntStream.  It forces me to do a typecast like the
following:

             private void resetStream() {
                TreeNodeStream nodeStream=getTreeNodeStream();
                if (nodeStream instanceof BufferedTreeNodeStream)
                  ((BufferedTreeNodeStream)nodeStream).reset();
                else if (nodeStream instanceof CommonTreeNodeStream)
                  ((CommonTreeNodeStream)nodeStream).reset();
             }

Thanks for your help.

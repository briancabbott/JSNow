Oh crap.  I think I've got all this stuff mixed up.  Most stuff is 
setASTNodeType and there are a few setASTNodeClass methods.  The 
setASTNodeType method says deprecated.  Damn.

Anybody have any thoughts about which way it should be?  grep shows 
...NodeType to be the most popular version in the system. :(

I was thinking of doing just that.

</I>
Yeah, scripts are just not portable :(


&gt;<i> As well as build process how are you going to package antlr?  At the

</I>
I'm going to build antlr.jar with all .class files this time.  It'll be 
pretty small, so no biggie.

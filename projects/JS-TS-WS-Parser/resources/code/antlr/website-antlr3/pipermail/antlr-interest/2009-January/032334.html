<PRE>Hello,

for our student research project we implemented a C grammar in ANTLR
3.1. (The grammar fully implements ANSI C99, and mostly implements the
GNU C extensions - the notable exception being the attributes, which
are a real pain.) However we found the performance of the parser to be
a bit lacking. We therefore ran some tests. In addition to the default
Java target, we modified the grammar for the C target. The results
were then compared to the results obtained by using the GNU C
compiler. This is a fair comparison, since gcc also uses a  top-down
recursive parser (although hand-coded). Actually the test is tougher
on gcc, since gcc does full compilation, compared to just building the
AST in the case of ANTLR.

The results can be summarized as follows (more details about the test
at the end of this post):

 - ANTLR/Java is obviously the slowest one [and there is a serious
start-up/close-down overhead]
 - ANTLR/C is faster, but still miles behind the gcc
 - ANTLR/C uses the most system time (analysis using strace points to
many more memory-related calls to kernel)
 - ANTLR/C allocates the most memory. Several times the memory used by gcc

The comparison isn't very rigorous/scientific (by any means), but the
times are represenative, being rougly the average time for many
different runs. I was quite surprised by how much slower ANTLR is
comparing to the GCC. I also tried to profile the C target, the
results from gprof are attached.

Any comments?

Best regards,
	Jan Obdr&#382;&#225;lek

---------------

The grammar:
- backtracking is disabled
- only a few semantic/syntactic predicates
- the most obvious bottlenecks were fixed by left factorization

The input:
- preprocessed file from the Linux kernel, attributes removed
- ~20Kloc, ~700kB:
~/tmp/test$ wc a.c
 20604  80707 697787 a.c

The results
===========

GCC
---
~/tmp/test$ gcc --version
gcc (Ubuntu 4.3.2-1ubuntu11) 4.3.2

NOTE: Java VM uses 2 CPU cores, therefore the difference between real
and user/sys time

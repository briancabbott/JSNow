<PRE>Hi Chris:

&gt;<i> Perhaps your lawyers are concerned that not all contributors have stated
</I>&gt;<i> that their contributions are also placed in the public domain?
</I>
Yes, this is the exact that concern and the argument that our lawyers are using and in their eyes this is what makes ANTLR NOT a genuine open source product. And this is truly sad in the eyes of us developers.
 
Regards,
 
Addi

Hi Addi,

&gt;<i> The issue is rather simple in terms of legalities but complex in the

</I>&gt;<i> does not explicitly state that those who have contributed (or will
</I>&gt;<i> contribute) to ANTLR can not claim anything financially or otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> in any form or shape now or anytime in the future (i.e. standard open

</I>&gt;<i> can not (and in fact will not) be able to use the product for their
</I>&gt;<i> own protections.

I just had a look at the license, and it places ANTLR in the public
domain. Public domain means /you/ own the code as much as does anyone
else -- we own it collectively as a human race. One cannot claim any
rights over things placed in the public domain. That is the nature of
public domain -- all proprietary rights are revoked.

Perhaps your lawyers are concerned that not all contributors have stated
that their contributions are also placed in the public domain? This
might be a legitimate concern, I don't know. But barring someone
claiming their code made it into the product 'by accident', public
domain is about as good a deal as you can get. And a very generous
action by the authors.

Later,
Chris.

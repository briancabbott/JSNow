<PRE>Justin,


Use gperf to generate a perfect hash of your tokens. Use a simple rule to
match anything, then a custom dictionary for the lexer that uses your
pre-known token numbers. Look up in perfect hash and change the token to
the returned value. I have done this a number of times when there is a
large number of fixed keywords and it is easy to maintain. Perhaps you can
do everything you need with just gperf to be honest.



// Pick up the token definitions as assigned by ANTLR
//
#include &quot;MySqlLexer.h&quot;

// Certain keywords, as well as being part of the keyword set are also
// reserved words that cannot normally be used as identifiers the lexer
// defines the value IS_RESERVED for us to use to indicate this.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [antlr-interest] Best way to handle a large number of language
</I>&gt;<i> constants?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am working on a proprietary language of ours that is reminiscent of
</I>&gt;<i> BASIC in some ways, but has morphed over the years into its own
</I>&gt;<i> monstrosity. This language is primarily used to command our hardware
</I>&gt;<i> devices. Our system has a large number of &quot;parameters&quot; (762 to be
</I>&gt;<i> precise) that define the complex configuration of the hardware. This
</I>&gt;<i> configuration mainly lives in a file that is read and sent down to the
</I>&gt;<i> hardware (where it is stored as a simple array of values), but there is
</I>&gt;<i> also the desire to edit these parameters programmatically at runtime.
</I>&gt;<i> Each parameter has a name, and a numeric value. The desire is for each
</I>&gt;<i> parameter to be read/written through simple assignment statements. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, &quot;AxisType.X = 0&quot; assigns the value 0 to the AxisType parameter
</I>&gt;<i> on the X axis. This is currently implemented in a seemingly terrible
</I>&gt;<i> way, and I am looking for the best way to improve it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current implementation involves providing a #include file that
</I>&gt;<i> #defines each parameter as an array with a hard-coded index. This
</I>&gt;<i> include file is handled by the pre-processor so that the syntax in
</I>&gt;<i> question only has to handle the hard-coded array. The pre-processor is
</I>&gt;<i> not too terribly inefficient, but the problem is that we have to
</I>&gt;<i> distribute this enormous include file, and the users must remember to
</I>&gt;<i> include it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can imagine a couple of other ways to implement this, but I am not
</I>&gt;<i> sure what way would be the most efficient. One way would be to add
</I>&gt;<i> every parameter name as a keyword in the lexer. This has the benefit of
</I>&gt;<i> relying on ANTLR to do all of the lexing for me, so that I don't have
</I>&gt;<i> to parse any strings later in my own code. The problem is that this
</I>&gt;<i> requires a lot of custom code in the grammar file (each token must have
</I>&gt;<i> a well defined numeric index associated with it, to match the index
</I>&gt;<i> used internally in the arrays). Additionally, I don't know how well
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR will handle having so many hundreds of additional tokens in the
</I>&gt;<i> language. The good thing is that I could auto-generate the grammar from
</I>&gt;<i> our definition of the parameters (in XML format).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively, I could add a very generic rule to the lexer that would
</I>&gt;<i> match any potentially valid parameter name, and wait until the semantic
</I>&gt;<i> actions to validate this as an actual parameter or a syntax error.
</I>&gt;<i> While this allows for a much simpler grammar on the ANTLR end, what I
</I>&gt;<i> don't like about this that I then have to write a bunch of C code that
</I>&gt;<i> essentially parses the string again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I am looking for some advice on the best way to approach this
</I>&gt;<i> problem. If anyone has done something similar before, I would
</I>&gt;<i> appreciate any suggestions that you have for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Much thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>

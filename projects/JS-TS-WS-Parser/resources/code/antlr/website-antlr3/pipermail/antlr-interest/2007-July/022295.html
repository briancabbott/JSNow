I'm really not sure what the problem might be, since I've never 
experienced this symptom, myself.

In my (limited) experience, all that is required is that you give 
the &quot;-debug&quot; option to ANTLR when you build your parser from your 
grammer. Then, when you invoke that parser, it will wait for a 
connection from the debugger on the usual port (I don't know, offhand, 
how to alter the default, 49153).

There is one thing: While the parser seems to have an unlimited timeout 
(which is to say, I've never encountered a timeout), ANTLRWorks most 
certainly _does_ have a timeout (configurable via the &quot;Debug&quot; tab of 
the preferences dialog&#8212;if I recall, the default is 10 seconds), so if 
you issue the &quot;Debug remote...&quot; command and wait longer than its 
timeout before launching the parser, it will give up and alert you that 
it failed to connect.


&gt;<i>   Very much appreciated

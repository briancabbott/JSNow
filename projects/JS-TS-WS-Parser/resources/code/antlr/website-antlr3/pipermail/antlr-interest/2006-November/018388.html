<PRE>Hi,
 
Ok. I remember now that there may have been something posted to the list a
while back. One quick question, was it going to be _very_ different
(conceptually and implementation-wise) from what you did with ANTLR Studio?

Well, actually I was supposed to publish the paper along with Terence after
we implement it for antlr 3.
So everything is on hold right now :(

Hi,
 
Can you go ahead and publish just how this was supposed to work?. Perhaps
build a one-off V3 release with incremental lex/parse support?

Hi,
 Yes, we were originally planning to add the support for incremental parsing
in antlr 3, but since Terence has been busy with other stuff i  am unsure
whether it will be included in the first release or not.

I was reading the  Prashant Deva's article on ibm site and he was talking of
incremental lexing and parsing. I was wondering if ANTLR has any support
for it. If not is this something that would be supported in 3.0?

A discussion on how one would approch the problem given ANTLR as
the tool - for parser and lexer generation - would also be helpfull.

Thanks,
Alex.

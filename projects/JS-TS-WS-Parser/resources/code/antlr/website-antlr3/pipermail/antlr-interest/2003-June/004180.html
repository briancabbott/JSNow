<PRE>As usual, I'm struggling with the best way to structure my AST processing.  I followed the example from the GCC parser and create my own nodes, e.g.:
 
modelica_file
    : (within_clause)? ((&quot;final&quot;)? class_definition SEMI!)* EOF!
        { ## = #([FILE, &quot;FILE&quot;], ##); }
    ;

 
Note, specifically, the use of &quot;#([FILE, &quot;FILE&quot;], ...)&quot;
 
Now I'd like to use my own AST class for this node so I can associate additional &quot;meta&quot; information (i.e. data that gets generated as I make a few passes over the tree).  My personal preference is to have specific classes for each AST node.  I know you can do it in a generic way, but it just doesn't feel right to me.
 
OK, enough on that, here is the issue.  My token section looks like this:
 
tokens {
    FILE&lt;AST=FileNode&gt;; DECLARATION; DEFINITION; FUNCTION_CALL; TYPE;
   ...
}
 
Note the &quot;File&lt;AST=FileNode&gt;...&quot; part.
 
I would have thought that the combination of defining this special token (and the custom AST that goes with it) along with the tree construction shorthand would have created an appropriate &quot;initialFactory&quot; method for my parser that would have mapped a FILE token to a FileNode.  This doesn't happen.  It appears that ANTLR doesn't do this automatically for these &quot;synthetic&quot; tokens (ones that do not originate from the lexer).
 
So, is my assessment correct (i.e. this feature doesn't work with synthetic nodes...of which I have *many*).  Or am I doing something wrong?

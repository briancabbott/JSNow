<PRE>Johannes,

&gt;<i> &gt; The standard java runtime has no equivalent to the old 
</I>&gt;<i> Token class in C#.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; CommonToken and ClassicToken implement IToken but are otherwise 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unrelated (nor should they be). Token is useful for 
</I>&gt;<i> injecting common 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; behaviour when in custom variants of the runtime.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Firstly, people can create an own Token base class when truly 
</I>&gt;<i> necessary. 
</I>&gt;<i> Secondly, if we don't need it (which is because ClassicToken 
</I>&gt;<i> implements ANTLR v2 behaviour and CommonToken implements 
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR v3 behaviour) then it doesn't make sense to include it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I really can't see why anyone would try to combine both 
</I>&gt;<i> classes or to create another variant, which doesn't follow 
</I>&gt;<i> the behaviour of ClassicToken or CommonToken. For the latter, 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know if there is even a third possibility of 
</I>&gt;<i> semantics. It must be truly an oddball which we as runtime 
</I>&gt;<i> people for standard ANTLR shouldn't care about.
</I>
Not sure what to make of your opinions above.

I was just answering the question you asked about CommonToken (i.e. &quot;does
CommonToken already fulfil the role of Token in the C# runtime?&quot;). It
doesn't.

&gt;<i> &gt; Might be worth checking if Prebuild be moulded to generate 
</I>&gt;<i> Nant files 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that can build docs, the distro archives etc in addition to 
</I>&gt;<i> building 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the assemblies...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The distro archives? You mean the daily builds? For that 
</I>&gt;<i> using the ant-build is sufficient. One could add to the 
</I>&gt;<i> ant-build the building of the runtime targets at least as an 
</I>&gt;<i> option, as this would simplify things further.
</I>
No. Not the ANTLR tool builds. I was referring to the ANTLR C# runtime
distribution archives. For the downloads page.

I don't expect that C# devs would be happy to use Ant to build C# bits when
Nant exists. Conversely, I doubt that replacing the Ant build with a Nant
build would please Java devs wishing to build the java-based ANTLR tool
itself or indeed the java runtime. Same for C, Python....

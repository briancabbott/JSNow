<PRE>I'm thinking that a future version of ANTLR would pretty much support 
whatever &quot;module&quot; you wanted.  Sometimes a DFA-based lexer is easiest 
and sometimes a top-down lexer is better (such as parsing nested syntax 
within HTML tags or whatever).  Naturally you can always hook in your 
own hand-built lexer.

Thanks for the feedback.

I believe they use the first found rule.  Most specific has to be first 
if you want things to work right.

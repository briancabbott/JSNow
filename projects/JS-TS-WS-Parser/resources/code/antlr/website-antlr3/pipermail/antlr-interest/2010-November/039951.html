<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>The warning &quot;Semantic predicates were present but were hidden by
actions.&quot; is issued without any line# if any rule has a semantic
predicate before the first token and the predicate is preceeded by any
action. In a large grammar this can be very difficult to locate.

This message is also incorrect since the actual problem is that ANTLR
cannot hoist the predicate into a parent rule if there is an
intervening action. This condition is distinct from the other cause of
&quot;Semantic predicates were present but were hidden by actions.&quot; where
there are insufficient predicates to disambiguate the grammar. This
case of the &quot;Semantic predicates&quot; message should be changed to
something like &quot;Semantic Predicate on line[nnn] cannot be hoisted due
to a preceeding action.&quot;

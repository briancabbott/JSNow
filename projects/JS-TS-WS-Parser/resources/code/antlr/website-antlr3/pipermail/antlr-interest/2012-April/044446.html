</I>If I am understanding this correctly, you want to do partial parsing, and
then generating a partial AST because the file is to large. Since the lexer
has to lex/scan the entire text file to create the tokens for the parser,
you cannot do a partial lexing of the input.

Ter did something with scannerless parsing several months ago, but since I
never worked with it I cannot say it will help, but is something I
personally would look into for your problem, but not expect it to work. I
have had stranger suggestions that worked.

I would also profile the running of the grammar to see which part of the
grammar is using too much memory and try altering the grammar and/or adding
actions to correct the problem.

Usually one wants the entire AST before doing analysis, so I am curious as
to what you would do with an the AST tokens being processed as a stream
instead of a DOM.

As a worse case, you could switch to overriding parts of the ANTLR parser
with hand written code, or even worse, switch to a different type of
parser, i.e. LR, parser combinator, fully hand written recursive descent.

You can also contract for support from Ter.

 Eric.





&gt;<i> I ask because we are running into a problem with an extremely large file
</I>&gt;<i> being passed into our Antlr parser and it is causing memory exhaustion in
</I>&gt;<i> the parsing phase. I am thinking that using a TreeNodeStream would solve
</I>&gt;<i> this problem if it is even possible.

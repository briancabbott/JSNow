To be really frank with you, if I were writing a CSV tokenizer
(really, only a lexer is needed), I'd write it by hand.

Writing a basic tokenizer which only uses one character of lookahead
and only needs to provide one token to its consumer (i.e. it doesn't
need to stick tokens into a queue) is pretty easy, and it can be made
very fast if you're willing to use a character pointer and use the
null character as a string terminator. A post I made a few years back
on the comp.compilers newsgroup describes the essence of the process,
written in Delphi/Object Pascal (but it's fairly readable and
translatable into any C-based language, since it uses PChar - the
equivalent of char*):

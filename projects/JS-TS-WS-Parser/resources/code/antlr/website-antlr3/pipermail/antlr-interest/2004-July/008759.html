<PRE>Hi,

It will probably be a horror to try and do that.

ANTLR 3 will probably support C as target language (Terence mentioned using
plain C as a target to verify codegen for non exception supporting
langauges). ANTLR 3 will probably not see daylight till end this year
though.

I'll do the other evil ;) Write a codegenerator for C in ANTLR 2 ;) But
seriously if you have the time and wager on antlr 3 coming out this year
then it's probably an option. If you want to spent time/effort it can be an
option to write a minimalistic codegenerator/support lib for C. It also
depends a bit on what kindoff lex/yacc features (lexer states and such) you
use wether switching to ANTLR is easy or difficult. Another important
factor is the language you want to parse. Some things are a little bit
harder (or less efficient) to tackle in a LL(k) world.

I guess I'd try and see if converting the grammar to antlr would be
feasible and then decide on which way to go. But I guess there's easier
solutions out there (PCCTS maybe (think it targetted C too)?).

Cheers,

Ric

  &quot;I think we better split up.&quot;
  &quot;Good idea. We can do more damage that way.&quot;

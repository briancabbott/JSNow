</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protected rules do not produce tokens--they must be called by public
</I>&gt;<i> rules
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which do produce tokens.
</I>&gt;<i> Well it seems the token doesn't get created when you set the toke type
</I>&gt;<i> as skip , too.
</I>&gt;<i> Here is the code from a generated lexer -
</I>&gt;<i> if ( _createToken &amp;&amp; _token==null &amp;&amp; _ttype!=Token.SKIP ) {
</I>&gt;<i> 			_token = makeToken(_ttype);
</I>&gt;<i> 			_token.setText(new String(text.getBuffer(), _begin,
</I>&gt;<i> text.length()-_begin));
</I>&gt;<i> 		}
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So as you can see , in both the cases the token doesn't get created.
</I>&gt;<i> Then how are they different.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

Both protected and non-protected rules can lead to the creation of tokens.
However, protected rules do not create tokens of their own, but contribute
to other tokens.

e.g.

A: 'c' B 'd';
protected B: 'z';

When the lexer reads the input stream, it constructs an &quot;A&quot; token if it sees
'c' followed by 'z' followed by 'd'. However, it will never construct a &quot;B&quot;
token on its own, consisting of only the 'z', because it is a protected
rule.

Setting &quot;skip&quot; on a (constructed) token prevents it from being forwarded on
to the parser. Consequently, it is often used for comments and white-space,
since these are irrelevant to many parsers. I have no idea what setting skip
on a protected rule does, though. Probably just changes the skip flag on the
encapsulating rule(s).

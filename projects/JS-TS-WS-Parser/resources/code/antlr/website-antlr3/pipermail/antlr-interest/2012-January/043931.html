<PRE>Terence:

One interleaved question.

&gt;<i> Hi Jan, honey badger's parsing strategy is and adaptive or incremental version of LL(*). The reason that v3 ANTLR needed to backtrack was that LL(*) grammar analysis is undecidable statically.  When it failed at static analysis, it failed over to backtracking at runtime. However, at runtime, I have an actual input stream that I can work with. This renders the algorithm deterministic and so I don't need to backtrack. In a nutshell, like GLR I pursue all possible paths from the decision point in a breadth first manner, almost as if I had forked multiple threads to pursue the possibilities. Because we pursue all possibilities at once, there is no backtracking. We move one token at a time seeing where it takes us in all possible alternatives. When only a single alternative is left, we know to predict that Alternative. We rewind the input and then take the appropriate path.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> LL(*) is O(n) for a given decision because in the worst case it might look scan until the end of the input. If we must make a decision at every token, that is an O(n^2) parsing strategy for n tokens.  That actually hides another complexity that generally does not appear. We are doing what amounts to a more complicated NFA to DFA conversion, which we know is exponential in complexity (in theory but not in practice). That means that a particular decision could hit a landmine at some point. I have seen one example of this. I have some interesting ideas for altering the algorithm so this does not occur.  I'll get to it.

I assume the coefficient for the n^2 behavior depends on the (average/worst case?) number of alternatives at each token Could that blow up in a way that kills performance?

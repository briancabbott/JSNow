<PRE>Hello all,

I'm getting close to the point where I need to start working no my master's 
thesis and am throwing around some ideas, so I thought I would see what 
suggestions some of you might have.

Here are a few thoughts that have crossed my mind, each of which somehow 
relates to parsing or compiler design (in no particular order):

1) Incremental parsing (specifically for not re-parsing an entire file, for 
example within an IDE).  This could be interesting, both in theory and to try 
to make Antlr support this.

2) Create a static code analysis tool, probably to handle C/C++ code although 
if I used the right IR trees, it could probably easily be expanded to other 
languages fairly easily.  This would probably also present the ability to 
create a mini-language of sorts, something that would allow you to create 
specific test cases that the programmer was interested in, with a certain 
standard set of featurs.

3) Something with Antlr-v3 and probably/hopefully Python ;), perhaps wrapping 
the C/C++ generated code so that it can be used as an extension module, 
assuming they were considerably faster than the regular Python one (only real 
reason to do such)?

I'm sure there are other things that will cross my mind at some point, but 
those are the first ideas that have crossed my mind (that I can still 
remember).

Right now, I'm looking for an idea that I will enjoy but also allows me the 
chance to do both theory and coding.

Ideas?

Thanks.

PS: Ter, I hope your dvorak skills are coming along.  I switched to dvorak 
about two and a half years ago (maybe three now) and I'm probably 20-40% 
faster than I was back then, and I was quite capable then.  It's definitely 
worth it (although the efficiency takes a while to pick back up)!  Keep at it 
and good luck!

<PRE>&gt;<i> I don't understand the fuss. If Prashant has the feeling he want to

Well, that is not the difference between open source and free software, 
between OSI-compliant and GPL-compliant licenses. It has nothing to do with 
pricing models.
Anyhow, I'm one of those who are willing to pay for good software, but not at 
the price of my freedom and the ones who could eventually use my 
contributions on it.
For me, first is freedom, second is price. If someone develop a tool like 
ANTLR Studio, I'm initially interested, until I notice the author doesn't 
think I deserve the rights I don't want to &quot;give away&quot;.
The sad thing about these kind of discussions is the fact that both opinions 
are considered equally acceptable, even when one approach cares about people 
and the other just doesn't consider it, by using 
&quot;monetary&quot;/&quot;real-life&quot;/&quot;non-comunist&quot; arguments.

At this point, I cannot end without asking Terence a question I'm sure he has 
answered many times (sorry for that): Why isn't ANTLR GPLed?

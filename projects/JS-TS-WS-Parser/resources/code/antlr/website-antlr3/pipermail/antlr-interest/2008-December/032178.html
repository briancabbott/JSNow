<PRE>Hi Jim,
        In this case, the problem goes like this
The client will request
-- Execute this Object.

The object has a type and a text(to be parsed). So the parsing depends on
the type of the object. So in the code, external to the parser, i have to
find out the type of the object. In Bison, this type is being sent as the
first token. After attempting at it for sometime, i decided to store it as
one of the variables inside the Parser Scope(as this is a C-language Target
and requires thread-safety).  So there will be a function in members that
will set this variable, before parsing starts and i will query it during
parsing.

Please let me know, whether my approach is right.

I have just completed the grammar part.I will post the entire source after
completing it. I also would like to know, if i can post the grammar in the
&quot;Grammars section&quot;.

Thanks,
Gokul.

</I>&gt;<i> I think that it is unlikely that you need to do this as some of the
</I>&gt;<i> reasons that you would do this in bison are not limitations in ANTLR.
</I>&gt;<i> For parsing you only need a token type and then access to the text that
</I>&gt;<i> this represents, then you may or may not require a custom token type for
</I>&gt;<i> an AST node for your tree.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, you can change token types in the lexer by looking ahead in the
</I>&gt;<i> character stream and making decisions on what you see (which is
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes required), or more likely, just return something generic like
</I>&gt;<i> ID, and let the parser work out what this represents.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can emit() multiple tokens if you really need to, but the chances
</I>&gt;<i> are fairly slim that you really need to I think. Gavin pointed out where
</I>&gt;<i> you start, but the code needed to implement this is fairly involved and
</I>&gt;<i> I bet if you just rethink your lexer/parser in an 'ANTLR' way, you will
</I>&gt;<i> find you don't need to do it.

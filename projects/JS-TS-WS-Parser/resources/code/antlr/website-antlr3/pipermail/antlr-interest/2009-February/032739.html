</I>That's by far the easiest way, which is why I did that. Mostly, that's 
all people need. However, you can also write your own tree adaptor that 
just passes around (void *). Not a task for the inexperienced C 
programmer though. But if you copy the adaptor code and fill in your own 
functions, that will work. Much easier to just add your nodes to the u 
pointer though and let the current stuff do all the work :-)

<PRE>Rupinder,
 
Have a look here at the ANTLR project here and especially the annotation
tool. The author uses it to maintain a single tree parser grammar for
multiple walks. You can adapt it for single grammar and multiple languages
too. You would probably want to move to a one-grammar-per-*.g-file
arrangement for this to work smoothly.

Incidentally, there is no guarantee that you will receive a response (let
alone a &quot;satisfactory response&quot;) from any mailing list staffed by
volunteers. ;-)
 
 
Cheers,
 
Micheal

Subject: [antlr-interest] Urgent: how to &quot;include&quot; a grammar defined in
aseparate file 



(I posted a query a week ago but didn't receive a satisfactory response.) 
I have a grammar for logical-expressions from which I need to build the
following: 
- Java lexer and parser 
- C# lexer and parser 
- Two java tree-walkers 
- One C# tree-walkers 

The two java tree-walkers are in independent projects; both projects do
depend on the project that defines the grammar (and contains lexer and
parser).  C# lexer, parser and tree-walker can be in the same project.  I
want to keep only one copy of the common.g file (one containing parser and
lexer sections).  How do I this?

Grammar inheritance nor importVocab seem to be up to the task.  Or am I
missing something? 

Thanks, 
R.G.

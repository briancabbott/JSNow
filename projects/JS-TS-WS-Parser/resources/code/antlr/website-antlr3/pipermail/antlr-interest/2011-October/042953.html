<PRE>Andy,

In addition to the other's suggestions, change HIDDEN to Hidden.  The C# target attempts to use standard C# conventions when possible. It can be frustrating when working from the books and Java-focused documentation, but once you get past the few differences and gain some momentum, you should not have too many other compatibility issues.

Subject: Re: [antlr-interest] How viable is the Csharp3 target? (more specific questions)

Hi,



First, thanks for the encouragement. Knowing there are active users out there makes all the difference.



I've now taken the first example from &quot;the definitive ANTLR reference&quot; and tried to get it to work, first using the Visual Studio Extensions and templates, and then also manually running the ANTLR3.exe file at the command line, just to verify that my problems are in the generated code and are not errors generated during the generation of code (since the Visual Studio Extensions and associated instructions seem to produce projects that both generate code and then build it).



So my grammar is this simple:



grammar Lexer1;



options {

    language=CSharp3;

}



/** Match things like &quot;call foo;&quot; */

r : 'call' ID ';' {System.out.println(&quot;invoke &quot;+$ID.text);} ;

ID: 'a'..'z'+ ;

WS: (' '|'\n'|'\r')+   {$channel=HIDDEN;} ; // ignore whitespace



When I compile the code generated by ANTLR3, I get these errors:


K:\Plantronics\Development Sandbox\AntlrTest\AntlrTest\obj\x86\Debug\Lexer1Parser.cs(28,2): warning CS3021: 'Lexer1Parser' does not need a CLSCompliant attribute because the assembly does not have a CLSCompliant attribute K:\Plantronics\Development Sandbox\AntlrTest\AntlrTest\obj\x86\Debug\Lexer1Parser.cs(86,11): error CS1041: Identifier expected; 'out' is a keyword K:\Plantronics\Development Sandbox\AntlrTest\AntlrTest\obj\x86\Debug\Lexer1Parser.cs(86,11): error CS1525: Invalid expression term 'out'
K:\Plantronics\Development Sandbox\AntlrTest\AntlrTest\obj\x86\Debug\Lexer1Lexer.cs(28,2): warning CS3021: 'Lexer1Lexer' does not need a CLSCompliant attribute because the assembly does not have a CLSCompliant attribute K:\Plantronics\Development Sandbox\AntlrTest\AntlrTest\obj\x86\Debug\Lexer1Lexer.cs(276,13): error CS0103: The name 'HIDDEN' does not exist in the current context



The errors regarding &quot;System.out&quot; make sense, that seems like a call to a Java function that does not exist in C#. However the error with HIDDEN is confusing to me, and it is the result of sub a basic construct ({$channel=HIDDEN:};). I can't imagine what I am doing wrong to cause this, and since it is the first example pulled out of the book, you would think it would work!



Can someone help me here? I'm gaining confidence, but I'm having trouble even walking before I can run!



Oh, also: What are the files Antlr3.Targets.CSharp2.dll and Antlr3.Targets.CSharp3.dll for?



-          Andy

Hi Andy &amp; Maik,



I agree that the C# target documentation is lacking in many ways. I try to keep enough documentation at the following page to get you started on the right path:

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Antlr3CSharpReleases">http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Antlr3CSharpReleases</A>



I've been using the CSharp3 target in a commercial product for 3 years now.

At this point, most of the remaining the issues I have with it are basic/technical limitations of ANTLR 3 that will hopefully be resolved in later versions.



Sam

Hi Andy!



I am using ANTLR's C# target for a couple of weeks now to create a domain specific language that is a subset of the C programming language.



My experience is similar to yours, but I can assure you that the C# target works and that it is actively maintained. It differs from the Java target in a few places, but it works.



The biggest problem is finding documentation. I've both of Terence Parr's books on my desk and the folks on this mailing list are very friendly and competent.



Cheers,

Maik

<PRE>I've run across a difficulty.  Assume the token filter piece is working.  I
like the idea.

I have a bunch of examples that don't fit with the screw-y-ness of JCL.

Example I

OBJECT1 value: &quot;Mon&quot;
OBJECT2 value: &quot;ty&quot;

JCL TEXT:

//S02 EXEC PGM=THEFULL&amp;OBJECT1&amp;OBJECT2


Result will be

//SO2 EXEC PGM=THEFULLMonty

To hold the token queue model, the Parser rule for an identifier would be
(IDENT)* to concatenate all the parts of Monty together.  Or would another
filter be a wise choice?


Example II

String strangeness

//S02 EXEC PGM=Monty,VALUENAME='&amp;INARDS'

INARDS could be = &quot;DISP=SHR&quot;;


The result is 
//S02 EXEC PGM=Monty,VALUENAME='DISP=SHR'

The tokens that would be in the token queue would be different than if the
example was


//S02 EXEC PGM=Monty,&amp;INARDS

resulting in 

//S02 EXEC PGM=Monty,DISP=SHR




Matching &amp;INARDS in the token filter I would want to shove out STRING in the
first example.  The second example I want to shove out &quot;IDENT&quot; EQU &quot;IDENT&quot;
on three successive trips to the token filter.

Once again, any help is greatly appreciated.

Jim

Why don't you just insert all the tokens into the stream?  Basically you
could keep a token queue in your filter and just be sure to empty the queue
before you pull another token from the lexer.

Hi all,
  JCL has a number of fun recognition problems for which ANTLR might have
solutions.  There hasn't been a publicly available JCL grammar, as far as I
know.  I'll start with a direct ANTLR related question, just to get the ball
rolling.

  JCL has &quot;symbolic replacement&quot;.  For example, &quot;OBJECT&quot; below would be
assigned a value, say &quot;FILE.NAME&quot;.

//SYSLIN DD DSN=&amp;OBJECT,UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(CYL,1)

  which results in 

//SYSLIN DD DSN=FILE.NAME,UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(CYL,1)

  For this example I see a TokenStreamFilter working nicely.  I gather the
definitions (Hashtable), get a &quot;symbolic&quot; token, look up the definition and
replace the text.

  Another example gets more complicated. Setting OBJECT =
&quot;FILE.NEW,MYOPTION(1,4)&quot;, would translate to


//SYSLIN DD DSN=FILE.NEW,MYOPTION(1,4),UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(CYL,1)

 I don't have a token for token match.  I would be more comfortable
resorting back to a character stream and re-lexing.  I'd be glad to make the
example clearer if it isn't well described.

  Looking forward to hearing opinions, comments and being directed down
productive paths..... if there is such parsing JCL.

Jim

Mike,

I think GOLD is a competent LALR parser gen toolkit too. Didn't like
the closed source grammar builder though.

In any case, since you already have an LALR lexer/parser gen toolkit
that generates Delphi code, what feature of the GOLD toolkit (and
runtime engines) is tempting/persuading you to switch to it. IOW, what
does it do that other Delphi-friendly Lex/Yacc descendants - that
you've looked at - don't?

Micheal

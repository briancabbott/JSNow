<PRE>&gt;<i> I am struggling with the INCLUDE file mechanism.  It hides 
</I>&gt;<i> the INCLUDE file statement from the main parser. 
</I>&gt;<i> An INCLUDE statement is not part of the C language.  
</I>
There are several constructs in JCL that need to be handled 
before actual parsing can be performed, e.g.

- symbol substitution (EXEC PROC, SET, PROC, etc.)
- file include (EXEC PROC, INCLUDE)
- inline data (DD *, DD DLM=...)
- etc.

I would advise you to take the preprocessor route. It would be 
VERY difficult to build a one-pass parser that does both
preprocessing and parsing.

In fact, even the preprocessing of JCL is pretty complex.

Hope this helps, kind greetings,

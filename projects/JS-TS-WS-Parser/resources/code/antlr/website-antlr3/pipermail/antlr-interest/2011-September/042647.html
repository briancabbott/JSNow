<PRE>Hi.
I think the @rulecatch has to be specified per rule, which makes it at least
cumbersome for pretty much all grammars. Please correct me if I am wrong.
How about the lexer?
Do you mean failing on first error is useless? I think it is not - for
example, we have a simple DSL for path evaluation (something like GPath from
groovy) and we translate short path expressoins it to some other
representation that is then evaluated by unified EL with our custom
resolvers (no, the native EL syntax was not what was needed, hence we
translate). I don't want any recovery here, with some artificial tokens
inserted for me - I want the whole path to fail. As I was not the only one
who searched for an answer (the ANTLR site has a dedicated site for it) I
guess it is not so uncommon.
I agree that recovery is nice in some cases, but not in all of them.

Thank you for your answer.

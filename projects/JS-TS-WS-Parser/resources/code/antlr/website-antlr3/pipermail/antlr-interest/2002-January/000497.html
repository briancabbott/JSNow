Nope.  (not yet?)  I talked with a friend at M$ who said he had one .5 
finished, but he's probably too busy to finish.  Code is pretty dark and 
icky in there ;)

</I>
The example grammars are a good step, but (mea culpa mea culpa) there is 
no good regression test.  Nothing automated anyway.

As for a code generator, the diff between CPP and Java should be a good 
clue.  You need a code generator object called CSharpCodeGenerator 
(subclass of CodeGenerator) plus an action.g file to parse C# actions 
within a grammar and lots of support code in C# that would mimick the 
C++ and Java stuff.

Probably not something that can be done that quickly, although C# is 
remarkably close to Java ;)

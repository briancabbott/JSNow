<PRE>Hi,

Many thanks for this clear analysis =)

Hmmm this is not good. I'd rather not switch to a different STL
implementation just because one compiler screws up. Then I'd rather switch
to using custom classes, as this would also make the ppl happy that want a
smaller support lib.

&gt;<i> PS: I have attached the workspace for the antlr lib/dll (intended to go to
</I>&gt;<i> lib\cpp), and also for the tinyc example (intended to go to examples\cpp)
</I>&gt;<i> which contains four targets (debug/release static library which works as
</I>&gt;<i> far as I can see, and debug/release dll which does not work as described
</I>&gt;<i> above).

Thanks a lot!

     Human beings, who are almost unique in having the ability to learn
   from the experience of others, are also remarkable for their apparent
         disinclination to do so. --- Douglas Adams, Last Chance to See

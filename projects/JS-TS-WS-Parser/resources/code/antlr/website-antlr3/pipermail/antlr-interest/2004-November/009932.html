Hello,

and thanks for the clarifying answers! I see what you mean by 
unsolved references problem: I think I did a two pass in my hand 
coded parser: Thus, I will probably be better of Walking the Tree 
(line :-)). And as you say; I get the conext info for &quot;free&quot; which 
can be usefull for the debugger.

The next thing I would love to get my hands on, is this: An ANTLR 
example aka. the Calc example, but that also adds: function 
definition and function call AND walks a tree to execute the stuff. 
The problem with the provided examples like TinyBasic is that it is 
to big, to much to grasp. A very simple example makes it easier to 
grasp the principle and get flying. I am currently reading the ANTLR 
Reference Manual, but that is a time consuming feat....

&gt;<i> &gt; simply emit the stack instructions from the Parser part of ANTLR?

</I>&gt;<i> evaluator be more complicated and do the fix-ups for you but that 
</I>is, in
&gt;<i> essence, another pass so you've just moved the problem from one 
</I>place to
&gt;<i> another.]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I feel pretty comfortable setting up the Lexer and Parser part 
</I>in ANTLR
&gt;<i> &gt; (I think), but the TreeParser part is unfamiliar ground although 
</I>I think
&gt;<i> &gt; I grasp the basics.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Q2: What would be easier: Implementing a debugger for the Stack 
</I>Machine
&gt;<i> &gt; or the solution where code is executed walking the tree (is this 
</I>called a
&gt;<i> &gt; register machine?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (A) They are basically equivalent given good engineering (i.e., 
</I>good
&gt;<i> factoring).  The stack evaluator is a bit more localized but the 
</I>tree
&gt;<i> evaluator has the explicit context of the tree.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (B) A register machine is something that looks like a CPU.  I.e., 
</I>it's
&gt;<i> model wherein there are (banks of) registers in which computation 
</I>takes
&gt;<i> place, usually some form of &quot;hardware&quot; supported stack, and 
</I>general/heap
&gt;<i> memory.  GCC's RTL is an example of an intermediate representation 
</I>(IR)
&gt;<i> of a register machine model.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this helps,

It's a normal attribute so it does not need an explicit delete. If it had
been a pointer to a string then it would be missing a delete. AFAIK the
base library has no or neglectible memory leaks (last time I checked). In
the case the text strings don't get deleted then you got a buggy
compiler/standard library.

It would be helpfull to know antlr version, compiler version. Also details
like using a custom ast and such.

With the refcounted ast's it's pretty easy to do something that leaves a
reference to a complete ast floating about which results in the whole thing
not getting deleted. (or if you made a circular reference with a custom ast)

One could add a static counter to the constructor/destructors of the ast
classes and see if the complete ast gets deleted. Or compile with a memory
tracker that gives more precise information.

It can also be that this is part of your standard libraries
implementation.... It is common to have a few chunks of memory floating
around after program exit, due to internal buffers storage of the support
libraries of a compiler.

Cheers,

Ric

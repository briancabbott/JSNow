That depends on how easy it is to change the codeGen. As I said this
can be done in a real simple way inside an ide.
If its simple enough then common users can modify it to suit their
trees and the maintenance part can be shifted to the users, instead of
antlr maintainers.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My approach--wrap the tree root with an AST adaptor class, and wrap and

</I>&gt;<i> approach for 1a, and wins (tied with Scott) in 2 and 3.  Prashant's approach
</I>&gt;<i> wins in 5 if the implementation supports generating trees with a hybrid
</I>&gt;<i> structure.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Prashant's approach wins in 1, since the added overhead is at compile time
</I>&gt;<i> (ANTLR invocation) and not runtime.  However, that does not mean his
</I>&gt;<i> approach is optimal:  ANTLR is designed for linked sibling lists, not for
</I>&gt;<i> child arrays.  The performance differential for sibling lists between the
</I>&gt;<i> adaptor approach and the compilation approach will be small.  The
</I>&gt;<i> compilation approach has the highest implementation cost--an adaptor will
</I>&gt;<i> cost 50-100 lines of code in the typical case, and more for complex tree
</I>&gt;<i> structures; Prashant's approach, on the other hand, will touch most
</I>&gt;<i> generated code to adapt between tree models (Ter listed the two common
</I>&gt;<i> structures; hybrid tree structures are also possible).  Also, the
</I>&gt;<i> implementation cost is borne by the ANTLR maintainers (Ter plus the backend
</I>&gt;<i> authors), not by the application developer.  Maintenance is in the hands of
</I>&gt;<i> the ANTLR maintainers with Prashant's approach.  That translates to a lose
</I>&gt;<i> in 3a, unless the ANTLR maintainer has applications depending on the
</I>&gt;<i> capability, and also in 3b for the same reason.  This approach probably
</I>&gt;<i> loses to the per-AST adaptor approach for 4, although it could break even if
</I>&gt;<i> significant effort were put into supporting hybrid tree structures (both
</I>&gt;<i> linked sibling lists and child arrays present).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The take home message?  The current level of support is near-optimal, as

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I have a sort of real twisted idea on how to make Antlr parse any

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So lets see,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Problem: Currently we cannot parse stuff like xml dom trees since
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; their ast interface differs from the AST interface used by antlr tree
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; parsers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Solution: All the solution suggested till now suggest to somehow adapt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the 2 different interfaces.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I have got a pretty twisted sort of solution for the whole thing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; What if you could change antlr itself to handle exactly your tree's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; interface?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Prashant.  I like it. :)  A very interesting twist.  How general
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would it have to be I wonder to be useful.  For example, could it be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just the method names to use?  Probably not.  I think that if we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could agree on the available arguments to functions such as the child
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; index etc... we could let the user specify templates.  This is one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nice thing about using StringTemplate for code gen.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Loring and Monty and I discussed something like this for tokens and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ASTs at the Oregon ANTLR cabal.  But we thought in terms of what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; properties you could have.  Perhaps we should go further and specify
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the templates used to do common operations.  For example, here's one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; kind of tree access using ST notation:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; getChild(node,index) ::= &quot;node.getChild(index)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and here's another:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; getChild(node,index) ::= &quot;node.children[index]&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Interesting.  In this way there would be no penalty going through a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tree adapter for example to access the other tree.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hmm...I also like no casting...I'm getting mighty tired of casting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when using data structures I can tell ya!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Great line of thinking!  Can anybody think of problems?

<PRE>Loring,

I tend to think of the issue as one of &quot;what's the best overall approach 
for what you're doing?&quot;.
I feel like for what I'm doing, I find a token sequence easier to work 
with than a tree structure.
I did start out using AST transformation, but about 3 months into it, I 
rewrote everything I
had to get rid of the ASTs. I can easily picture &quot;&lt;type&gt; f(&lt;args&gt;) {&quot; as 
a sequence of tokens,
but I can't easily picture it as a tree.

I certainly don't mean to say &quot;no problem needs treewalkers&quot;. But I do 
think that as the
size of the task grows, the treewalker/AST approach gets less and less 
useful. I think if
you started out naively writing a natural language translator, you'd do 
a  tree structure.
But after a few months of trying to picture sentences as trees, you'd 
get frustrated.
On day, you'd spend 24 hours straight staring at the sentence &quot;Woods 
Eyes Masters&quot; and realize
it's hopeless.

I feel like that's what I went through with C to Java. To convert a 
typical &quot;printf&quot; call
into it's java equivalent, I'm just going to have to write a bunch of 
code to do that,
and having my input in a tree structure doesn't help me write that code.

I think there's too much &quot;conventional thinking&quot; going on that assumes 
that a language-to-language
(from one high-level language to another, including libraries, and 
producing &quot;natural&quot; code)
translator is similar to a compiler. It's as if we assumed that an 
English-to-Spanish translator
is best designed in the same way as an English-to-MorseCode translator.

I do agree that the tree transformation tools seem to be way too 
limited. TXL came as close
to doing what I needed as an English-to-Spanish dictionary comes close 
to what a UN
interpreter does. Not only that, an AST lets me easily find out what 
function I'm in. That's
as useful as the professional interpreter knowing that &quot;house&quot; is 
&quot;casa&quot;...yes, its necessary, but
if you think it's insignificant. Knowing the &quot;house to casa&quot; mappings is 
maybe 0.01% of the
work. And knowing where you are in the tree is also 0.01% of the work.

So I prefer these steps:
1) Lexing (input to token stream)
2) Search-and-replace (altering the token stream)
3) Repeat step 2, many times
4) Output (pretty-print token stream).

I think my unconventional approach comes from an unconventional starting 
point: the goal
of converting C, C++, COBOL to &quot;natural&quot; Java. Given that goal, the 
problem isn't a matter
of &quot;walk a tree and be sure to do something with every node&quot;. It's far 
more complicated than
that. For starters, consider &quot;what do I do at a FUNCTION_CALL node with 
text 'memset'? And
repeat that for each of the standard C library functions.

I agree I have a warped perspective :) Whether any term-rewrite system 
could ever be good
enough to make me reconsider, I don't know. I had looked into TXL and 
SemanticDesign's DMS,
and of course ANTLR. I had your typical 20-year programmer background 
with BS and MS in CS
degrees, experience with Lex and Yacc and similar tools, and I guess a 
health disrespect for
conventional approaches :)

Andy

&gt;&gt;<i> As far as I recall, Prashant never said it would be free. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;video-only&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> previews were just to demonstrate what he was doing and gauge interest.
</I>&gt;<i> This was the impression letted to me and to many others I talked to.
</I>
In other words, if I don't say right from the start it's not free, it
*has* to be free?

Sheesh...

I made the same assumption upfront, and when he told me has was charging
for it I didn't even think twice about it. Totally within his right, and
there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.

That said, I suspect fewer people will use it because they can't leech it,
or because their so-called &quot;morals&quot; won't let them.

Not to get on a GPL diatribe, but I think it's a load of crap. If someone
wants to donate their work to others, that's cool. If someone wants to try
and recoup a little money for their time writing it, that's cool as well.

&gt;&gt;<i> RE &quot;testing a commercial product&quot;, have you never heard of public
</I>betas? Many many many commercial products have public betas, and some
even ask that
&gt;&gt;<i> you pay to participate (the M$ office betas, for example).
</I>&gt;<i> Who said thy can serve as a model.
</I>
(I assume &quot;they&quot; instead of &quot;thy&quot;)

I did. They exist (and have a right to). Just because you don't like their
approach doesn't make it invalid; it just means you don't agree with them,
and that's only a problem for people with that opinion.


&gt;&gt;<i> Absolutely nothing wrong with this, so please chill...
</I>&gt;<i> Just because it's legal, it doesn't mean it's moral or fair. Don't get
</I>me wrong, I'm talking
&gt;<i> about M$ :). I really dislike this kind of 'tactics' also when others
</I>try to copy them :).

I did *not* say Prashant was copying these &quot;tactics&quot;. I don't feel these
*are &quot;tactics&quot;. It's a business model that worked for them.

If you don't want to pay for it, then don't. Noone said you have to.

What if I said &quot;it's immoral to *expect* all software to be free&quot;? Does
that make it immoral? Of course not. Claiming &quot;it's immoral to charge for
software&quot; is just as nonsensical.

Later,

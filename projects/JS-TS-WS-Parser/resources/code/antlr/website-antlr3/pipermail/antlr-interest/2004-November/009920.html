Hello,

I hand-coded my own lexer &amp; parser for a simple c-like language I 
wrote some 10 years ago. I used a stack machine to execute the 
compiled code. I also wrote a debugger for the same language.

I am now in the process of creating a similar language and it's 
debugger. I decided to use ANTLR because it supports both Java and 
C#.

It's a long time since I done this now, so go easy on me :-) I 
understand that I can use an autmatically generated AST and walk 
it's tree to execute the code instead of using a stack machine. 
However, I have a HARD time finding examples on how this is done 
e.g. for function declarations and calls. (abritrary number of 
parameters). The only thing I have found so far is CHAD, here:

<A HREF="http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2003/w4115f/final-">http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2003/w4115f/final-</A>
reports/CHAD.pdf

Appendix B page 56. shows the chad.g file

Looking at how function declarations and calls is handled walking 
the ChadWalker (p. 100) it looks VERY complex, in fact MUCH more 
complex than generating code for a Stack Machine! It also looks 
complex to DEBUG in case of errors!

Can anyone advise me here:

What's the easiest way to execute my code? Use a Stack Machine or 
Walk an auto-genrated AST? Remember, I also need to write a debugger 
for the language

nd please go easy on the terminology as I am an ANTLR newbie, and 
haven't worked with parsers for 10+ years.

And to the ANTLR people: More examples on this would have been nice.

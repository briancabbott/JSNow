<PRE>Using netstat -bv -an seems to show that the &quot;EventLog&quot; service is using
port 49153.

I've tried to disable the windows event log service to see if it would
make a difference, but it seems Vista doesn't want to let me do that.  I
can stop some other services, but the EventLog is depended upon by the
Task Scheduling service and it seems Vista won't let you turn that one
off or something.

 

So, if Gavin's guess is right that even &quot;local&quot; debugging is using the
network stack, how do I at least configure it to use an available port
(rather than an unavailable port)?  The only opportunity to specify a
port is when selecting &quot;Debug Remote...&quot; but I am selecting &quot;Debug...&quot;.

I'm brand new to antlr and to try to get off of the ground I'm trying to
go through the AntlrWorks tutorial at
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/works/help/tutorial/calculator.html.">http://www.antlr.org/works/help/tutorial/calculator.html.</A> When I get to
the part where I try to Debug I always get a modal Error dialog stating:
&quot;Cannot launch the remote parser because port 49153 is already in use&quot;.
But I'm just doing this tutorial straight-up.  What made AntlrWorks even
decide to do remote debugging in the first place? I thought it did Java
stuff (as this tutorial is) in-process? I am not selecting &quot;Debug
Remote...&quot; from the Debugger menu, rather I am selecting &quot;Debug...&quot;.


I'm not sure, but there's a decent chance that the plain Debug still
uses the same debug port as the &quot;real&quot; parser.  Most likely it's sharing
classes for simplicity.




For what it is worth:

netstat -an | findstr 49153

  TCP    0.0.0.0:49153          0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING

  TCP    [::]:49153             [::]:0                 LISTENING


Try using -bv as well -- that will tell you which process is listening
on that port.  Most likely you've got a dangling copy of the parser
lurking around somewhere.

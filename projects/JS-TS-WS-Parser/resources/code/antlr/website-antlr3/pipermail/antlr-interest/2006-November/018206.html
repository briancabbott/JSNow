<PRE>To be honest it is this sort of question (and the answer) that we need to have in the book. The problem is that I would not have thought of this question in a million years (and that is no slight on Andy at all).

For things like this though, remember that ANTLR tries to generate the minimum of code that is required to do the parse and does not automatically include things for stuff you MIGHT want to do as part of the parse. However, it makes it very easy for you to put your own bits of code in there. 

So, think of the grammar like a code template and 'feel' how it works its way through the syntax or the tree. Then where to put a simple counter or a symbol table will just come naturally (honestly, it will!)

The tree grammar says &quot;You will find this bit of tree at these places&quot;, then your counter just needs to be higher up the food chain than that to work, and then high enough up the chain to be in scope when you want to use it for something. Recognize something, reach back and count it/register it, move on through the tree.

Jim

You aren't.  You need to generate int n=0 and n++ code so you know  
what's up. ;)

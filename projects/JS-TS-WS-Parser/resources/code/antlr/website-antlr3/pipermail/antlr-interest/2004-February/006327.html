Hi,

Ok, I'm not an expert, nor am I an antlr developer, so this might be a very 
naive remark, but what if antlr is just re-released under the GPL license? 
Wouldn't that solve the problem?

Just my 2 cents....

Kind Regards,

Hans

</I>&gt;<i> One cannot assign or reliquish the rights of others.  If someone

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If not , we have better to do than discussing about software rights ,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, it's not that simple.  I'll be using ANTLR primarily for

</I>&gt;<i> or for which I do not hold the legal right to do so.  Which means I
</I>&gt;<i> lose the protection of that license (ie. that I cannot be sued for

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As an example, if a company using my open-source, ANTLR-based software

</I>&gt;<i> sufficiently open-source license), that company can turn around and sue
</I>&gt;<i> me for those damages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe you feel differently, but for me, it's well worth my time to
</I>&gt;<i> verify this stuff now.  And if I can't get those assurances, then I'll
</I>&gt;<i> probably be following Addi's company's lead in not using ANTLR.  And I
</I>&gt;<i> doubt I'll be the only open-source developer to do so.  And that would
</I>&gt;<i> be a real shame.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Later,
</I>&gt;<i>    Chris.

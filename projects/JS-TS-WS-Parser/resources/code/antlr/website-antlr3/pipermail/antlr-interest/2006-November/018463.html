Ah, I see. I think the reason was to not place any burden on the tree  
nodes, i.e.
you should be able to pass in everything, as long as it implements  
the basic Tree
interface. At some point Terence has said that he wants to support  
heterogeneous
trees again. It's just not done yet :(
You can probably hack around for the time being, it all depends on  
how much custom
code you are willing to invest at this point.

Definitely, but again, I can't say when that'll be, with the book and  
bugs and all.

cheers,

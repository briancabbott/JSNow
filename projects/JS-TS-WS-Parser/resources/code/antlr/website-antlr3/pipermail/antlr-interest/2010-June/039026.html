I received similar errors also using your grammar and test file but at
different lines and columns than you report. I hope that maybe your
reported errors are (hopefully) from some other input file? also I do
not use ANTLRWorks so maybe there is a difference therein (you appear to
be using the ANTLRWorks interpreter? - if so don't)

anyway.....

ANTLR lexers commit themselves to a set of possible tokens as soon as a
valid prefix for that set of tokens is encountered. the lexer will not
backup if the prefix turns out to be non viable.

in your case you have, for example, the keywords INDEX and INSERT. and
your input contains the word INTO. so when the lexer sees the I and N of
the INTO; it assumes that either a D or an S should appear next, but a T
appears; thus an error is emitted.

a simple fix is to add a lexer rule that will match any sequence of
letters. the lexer will then be able to recognize that token for cases
similar to the above. so add this lexer rule (at the very end of the
lexer):

WORD : ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z')+ ;

the lexer will now announce that the input INTO is a WORD token and life
is good...

hope this helps...

I will be putting a 'help' button right on the diagram view, just
click on it and it will show you the notation. Within 10 secs of usign
the ide u will be so used to it you won't like the normal diagrams.
The boxes look much prettier and convey much more info than a bunch of
arrows. Once you have looked at a few of them, you are totally usd to
them.

Yeah, but i am getting delayed cause of the craziest of reasons.

The city where i live , here in India, is having some major power
problems, and we are having power cuts *everyday* for (hold your
breath) upto *16 hours*!!!  yes,  16 hours! And this has been going on
for the last 10 days!!

Although power cuts are a common phenomenon here in India, it has
never happened like this. and no power backup systems here can provide
electricity for that much time.

I can finish in 1 week, provided that i get the power to switch on my
computer ;-)

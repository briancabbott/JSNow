<PRE>THERE ARE LEGAL PROBLEMS.

My ISP has exactly this problem. They can intercept and throw away
outbound mail without a problem, because they have a contract with the
sender. They can intercept and throw away mail sent to themselves
because (in the guise of employer) they are the recipient.

All hell would break lose if they threw away a message sent from an
outsider that was being forwarded through their systems to someone else
!!!

That said, as it's a Yahoo mailing list I would have thought Yahoo t's
and c's would apply. And why Yahoo can't do what another mailing list I
know of does, I don't know. That runs SpamAssassin with the &quot;flag but
don't delete&quot; setting. Should I so choose (I should) I could set my mail
client to autodelete anything to which the &quot;SPAM&quot; flag has been added.

Cheers,
Wol

&gt;<i> Actually, I think that the &quot;moderate new users&quot; setting might 
</I>&gt;<i> help--I can't see these idiots having enough technical savvy 
</I>&gt;<i> to post an inocuous message that doesn't raise red flags.  
</I>&gt;<i> Besides, they are in gross violation of yahoo policy to begin 
</I>&gt;<i> with:  all of  the porn spam that I have bothered to check 
</I>&gt;<i> refers to the eroticy site, and I'm surprised that yahoo has 
</I>&gt;<i> not taken legal action by now--we can't be the only group 
</I>&gt;<i> affected by this noise.

I don't want to spend too much bandwidth on this issue, but my point
really
is that Yahoo should install software that filters out this junk.  Most
every company has such software installed as a part of their firewall,
and
there are lots of programs that can be run on the desktop that do the
same.
There is no (technical) reason that Yahoo couldn't do the same.  I think
if
lots of users ask for it, that would help motivate them.

<PRE>The Antlr eclipse plugin implements such functionality. It does 
syntax highlighting and produces an outline of the grammar. I'm not 
100% familiar with the code but it appears to be using the builtin 
Eclipse support to do the syntax highlighting and an Antlr parser to 
do the outline view. The reconciling strategy handles document 
changes by simply reparsing the whole document upon any change. This 
also means the whole source model must be discarded each parse. 
There does not appear to be any support for tracking changes at a a 
lower-level which would become more critical if other, more 
complicated, tools are consuming the source model. I'm not sure how 
good the performance would be if this method was used for lower-
level features such as syntax highlighting or code completion which 
require more frequent updates. The Netbeans project implemented 
incremental lexing on top of an Antlr based lexer 
(lexer.netbeans.org), perhaps you could port something like that to 
Eclipse. Incremental parsing in Antlr seems to be a more difficult 
prospect (though Antlr 3 may make this easier). Batch parsing on top 
of incremental lexing may be good enough for code-completion and the 
like.

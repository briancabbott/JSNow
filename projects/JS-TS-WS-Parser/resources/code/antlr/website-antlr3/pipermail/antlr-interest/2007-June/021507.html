Ok, thanks for the explanation, Ter.

So ANTLR is doing the right thing, but the grammar itself has a  
defect (a rule which can never match for any input). I wonder if it  
would be possible to issue a warning for this case? I suspect not, as  
ANTLR can't know what might be in the predicate and can't know that  
it will never pass... Ah well... Just something to be aware of when  
using predicates!

About the only way I can think of to be aware of this risk is to  
check the grammar without the predicates. That yields the usual  
&quot;Decision can match input such as &quot;FOO&quot; using multiple alternatives:  
1, 2&quot; warning, which although ANTLR resolves it automatically in the  
way that the grammar author probably intended (ie. it does a greedy  
match of FOO+) it should still alert you to the fact that ANTLR is  
trying to &quot;see past&quot; the end of the rule to know when it should exit,  
which in turn means that your predicate could end up sucked back in  
to a place where you didn't expect it...

Cheers,
Wincent

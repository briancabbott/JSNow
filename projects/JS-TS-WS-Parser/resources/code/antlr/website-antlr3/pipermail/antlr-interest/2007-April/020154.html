It doesn't seem, as if you had added them already. Furthermore I don't
have the confirmation, that the issues lie with ANTLR, but that's where
I lost the trace. Look into the last emails with the subject &quot;Java
doesn't find class definition&quot; which I wrote. Two of them contain the
required descriptions. Regarding the wiki tutorial - I'll write it in
the next two days or so because of time constraints. Just FYI.

Best regards,

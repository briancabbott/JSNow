Subject: [antlr-interest] Lexer not as smart as it should be?

 

I'm trying to handle IP addresses in my lexer.  Below are the important
rules.





Have a browse of this thread from June regarding IPv4/IPv6 addresses and MAC
addresses:

 

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2005-June/012655.html">http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2005-June/012655.html</A>

 

You probably need to increase k&gt;=4 in the lexer, if you are defining one
rule as three digits followed by a dot. This is required to distinguish
between integers and IP addresses. If you then add floats you will have a
problem, so you probably need syntactic or semantic predicates for
disambiguation, or one big &quot;anything goes&quot; token that combines the lot.  

 

Mark and I had some good ideas for a suitable grammer, so check out the URL.

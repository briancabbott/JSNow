Michael:

&gt;<i> I suspect because developing in Java is more productive and, 
</I>
Ugh.  I've heard this argument raised many times, whether it's from the VB
crowd or the Delphi crowd or whoever.  Whether one language is &quot;more
productive&quot; than any other has far more to do with the skills and experience
of the person using the language in question, rather than the language
itself.  Even given someone who has equal expertise in multiple languages,
declaring one to be more productive than another is still subjective, and of
course, also dependent upon the particular task at hand.

Whether the ANTLR development effort over the years would be been less
productive if C++ was used is questionable.  Ter could be just as proficient
in C++ as he is in Java, and just chose Java for other reasons (which is why
I asked).

True that it would be impractical to post binaries for all platforms, but
given the nature of ANTLR, I would assume that most people interested in
such a tool would have access to a C++ compiler.  It's not uncommon on most
platforms to build your own tools from source code.

&gt;<i> Incidentally, the DFA-as-bytecode generation issue isn't a 
</I>&gt;<i> runtime limitation, it is a *language* limitation
</I>
Yes, and that's the reason I raised the issue.  Whenever you have to resort
to a hack in order to work around a fundamental language limitation, that
(IMO) calls into question whether the right language is being used for the
job.  It seems curious that Java has a goto in its runtime but no way to
express that in the language.

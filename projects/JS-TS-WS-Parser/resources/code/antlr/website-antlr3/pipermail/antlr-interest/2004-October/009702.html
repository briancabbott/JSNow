</I>I don't agree with you. I have programmed with C++ and Java. And I
think that for a medium/good programmer Java is more &quot;productive&quot; than
C++ (I don't say better, better implies things like efficiency) .

Some reasons:
Garbage collection is a lot more productive than manage the memory yourself.
A NullPointerException is better than a SegmentationFault. 
Java has a VERY good standard library, and well documented. C++ has a
standard library but with some holes that are system dependent. The
only think that I like more from C++ standard library is STL.
C++ compilers  aren't perfect. A thing that compiles with g++ possibly
won't compile (without modifications) with MSVC.
C++ needs more experienced programmers. Look at three Efective C++
books from Scott Meyers. To understand them you need a very high level
of C++ programming. And a medium programmer can look the Effective
Java book and understand it. Then to make reliable C++ code you have
to be aware of a lot of thinks that you haven't to do with Java.

Cheers,

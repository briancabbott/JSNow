Hi Hrvoje Nezic,

&gt;<i> I haven't used ANTLR for some time, now I installed 2.7.3rc2.
</I>&gt;<i> I am using the C# version.
</I>
Did you patch it as detailed on the list? (search for 2.7.3rc2 in the
archives)

&gt;<i> I would like to be able to get exceptions if input text is not correct.
</I>&gt;<i> However, it seems this is not the case. Exceptions are not thrown.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, error messages are written on the console.
</I>
AFAICR - and off the top of my head - this shouldn't be the case.

Questions:
1.  Did you *re-generate* your Lexer/Parser/TreeParser from your
grammar files using 2.7.3rc2?. 
2.  Did you also then re-build your C# project taking care to ensure
that you build against the 2.7.3rc2 runtime and not an older version?

If doing this doesn't fix the issue, send me a copy of your project
and I'll have a look at it.

&gt;<i> Is this by design, and can it be changed somehow?
</I>
I need to check if this happens as you describe first but, &quot;No. And
yes, it can be changed&quot;.

The intent is that ANTLR lexer/parser/treeparsers should be usable
from all application types and not just command-line apps.

&gt;<i> Is it possible to achieve that error messages are not written on the
</I>console?

Yes. That is the intent.

&gt;<i> My second question is about thread safety: are ANTLT-generated parsers 
</I>&gt;<i> (and especially the C# version) thread-safe?
</I>
No. And there is no advantage AFAICT in making them so IMHO. Or is there?

Cheers,

Micheal
ANTLR/C#

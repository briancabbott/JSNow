<PRE>Hi!

Does anybody know what are the factors that influence the size of the 
lookahead DFA? I read the ANTLR book, which is great. However, I found 
no details on how the LL* implementation actually computes these DFA's 
and how to avoid the DFA explosion that I encountered (is there a paper 
describing the ANTLR implementation of LL(*), btw?). I worked hard on my 
abap grammar, but I cannot figure out where this error comes from:

$ java -Xmx1g org.antlr.Tool ABAP4.g
warning(205): ABAP4.g:4468:2: ANTLR could not analyze this decision in 
rule atom; often this is because of recursive rule references visible 
from the left edge of alternatives.  ANTLR will r
e-analyze the decision with a fixed lookahead of k=1.  Consider using 
&quot;options {k=1;}&quot; for that decision and possibly adding a syntactic 
predicate.
error(10):  internal error: 
org.antlr.tool.Grammar.createLookaheadDFA(Grammar.java:1242): could not 
even do k=1 for decision 300; reason: timed out (&gt;1000ms)

This rule does not use recursion/loops/options etc, _but_ it contains a 
reference to a rule with 800 alternative tokens. When used in a simple 
hello-world grammar, things are fine and I can successfully parse a 
subset of ABAP. However, when I keep adding rules to the grammar, that 
_use_ atom, but that do not extend anything reachable from atom, after a 
certain threshold I get this error message. Lots of references to &quot;atom&quot; 
are at the end of rules, with +,*,? modifiers and the follow-sets of 
these rules (the rules that use  atom) often contain many of the 800 
keyword tokens, so there would be an ambiguity. I (hopefully) resolved 
every ambiguity, by using semantic predicates : at least I do not get 
any error message, only the one above .... I have a feeling that the 
error might still have to do with the ambiguities between (loops of) 
identifiers and the keywords following the enclosing rules. My question 
would be: why does ANTLR complain about a timeout in rule &quot;atom&quot;? Only a 
decision among the identifiier / 800 keywords is done there, not the 
ambiguity resolution. My intuition tells me that this should be done at 
the &quot;calling place&quot;, not inside &quot;atom&quot;.

Note that the error goes away with -Xconversiontimeout 20000 (on a 
recent 2.x GHz Core2Duo), but the generated Java code is rather large, 
exceeding the JVM's 64k limit in many different ways. However, I dont 
quite see why the DFAs should be so big? I hope there is someone on the 
list who has seen a similar problem. Unfortunately, I cannot post a nice 
and small grammar here: my smallest error-producing grammar is about 
5000 lines long.

Thanks a lot for any help!

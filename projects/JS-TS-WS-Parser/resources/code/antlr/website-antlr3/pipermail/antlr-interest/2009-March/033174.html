<PRE>Hey all,

With Gavin's generous help, I'm down to one error and a couple of 
warnings, which is nice.

In the attached grammar, I haven't fixed the lexer issues Gavin 
identified yet, as I'm focused on the parser for the moment.

The error is on line 473, as are two of the warnings. I can't say as I 
can figure out what it's getting at all, but I'm probably just being dumb.

The rule is

extensionAndException : '...' exceptionSpec? ;

and exceptionSpec is:

exceptionSpec : ('!' exceptionIdentification)? ;

exceptionIdentification : signedNumber | definedValue | type ':' value ;

The error and warnings are:

warning(200): workspace/asn.1-parse/grammars/ASN_1.g:346:82: Decision 
can match input such as &quot;'('&quot; using multiple alternatives: 1, 2
As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input
warning(200): workspace/asn.1-parse/grammars/ASN_1.g:473:31: Decision 
can match input such as &quot;'}'&quot; using multiple alternatives: 1, 2
As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input
warning(200): workspace/asn.1-parse/grammars/ASN_1.g:473:31: Decision 
can match input such as &quot;','&quot; using multiple alternatives: 1, 2
As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input
error(201): workspace/asn.1-parse/grammars/ASN_1.g:473:31: The following 
alternatives can never be matched: 2

My best guess is that the problem comes from &quot;type&quot; in the 
exceptionIdentification rule, but then I'd expect the error to be there, 
and not in extensionAndException.

The remaining warning, about rule 'type', I'm similarly at a loss about. 
The warning seems to refer to the reference to 'constraint'.

Thanks for any help anyone can give,

Sam

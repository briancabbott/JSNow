ANTLR will only consider dis-ambiguating semantic predicates for
the alternatives starting at the current token.

So when ANTLR is trying to figure out if the alternative:

  A {bar();} b=B ({foo($b)}? C D)? E;

is the one to take amongst other ambiguous alternatives,
ANTLR does not consider the dis-ambiguating semantic predicate
{foo($B)} that is 2 tokens ahead in the input stream (unless
syntactic predicates or backtracking are used, then I am not
sure, see note below).

This can be handled with dis-ambiguating semantic predicates.
Another dis-ambiguating semantic predicate can be written,
something like:

rule:
  {(isABfooOptE()}?
  A {bar();} b=B ({foo($b)}? C D)? E;

Where isABfooOptE() looks ahead for A followed by B, possibly
looking stuff up in the symbol table, calls a method that is
shared with the foo() dis-ambiguating sempred, and looks ahead
for E.

Since dis-ambiguating semantic predicates can call arbitrary
code, they are very powerful if you do not mind writing thousands
of lines of code.

I have thousands of lines of dis-ambiguating semantic predicates
that do things like:

- scan ahead looking for tokens, while matching things like
parentheses, etc.

- looking up stuff in the symbol table.

- doing stuff like this with hand coded recursive descent
compilers.  The dis-ambiguating semantic predicates are written
in little functions that correspond to the parser rules,
they call each other while scanning ahead.

- sometimes they scan backwards one or 2 tokens, looking for a pointer
into the symbol table that was earlier stored in a token if the
token is present.

Note: Maybe you were thinking of a situation with syntactic
predicates or backtracking as well as dis-ambiguating semantic
predicates.  I am not using syntactic predicates or backtracking,
so I don't have any experience with them.  Instead I have written lots
of dis-ambiguating semantic predicates using hand coded recursive
descent compilers, which is like hand coded backtracking.  The
hand coded recursive descent compilers have the option of cheating:
they can loosely decide to match an alternative, then a compiler
error can be generated if the alternative does not really match
while it is being parsed.

<PRE>I'm curious why it is important to you to have no syntactic ambiguity.  What
kind of language are you designing?

</I>&gt;<i> only a single corresponding parse tree (aka AST).  (Note that a
</I>&gt;<i> grammar might require infinite look-ahead and still be unambiguous.)
</I>&gt;<i> If a given string in the language can be parsed into more than one
</I>&gt;<i> valid tree, then the grammar is ambiguous.  The infamous
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;dangling-else&quot; problem is an example of syntactic ambiguity.  I want
</I>&gt;<i> to make sure I avoid such problems in my grammar.  (Of course,
</I>&gt;<i> imposing rules that say that an &quot;else&quot; attaches to the nearest &quot;if&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> used to eliminate the ambiguity in practice, but the grammar itself
</I>&gt;<i> does not encode these sorts of rules, and is therefore still
</I>&gt;<i> ambiguous.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As another example, the grammars of natural human languages are
</I>&gt;<i> typically overflowing with ambiguity.  We determine what the intended
</I>&gt;<i> meaning was from context and &quot;common sense&quot;.  There are constructed
</I>&gt;<i> human languages (e.g., Lojban, <A HREF="http://www.lojban.org">http://www.lojban.org</A>) which have
</I>&gt;<i> unambiguous grammars.  (I believe that Lojban may require infinite
</I>&gt;<i> lookahead, but it is unambiguous, and I believe an EBNF grammar can be
</I>&gt;<i> downloaded from somewhere on the above website.  Tools for parsing it
</I>&gt;<i> have been written; I'm not sure whether the parsers are top-down or
</I>&gt;<i> bottom-up.  It might be interesting to write an ANTLR grammar for it.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect that ANTLR, for all its power in generating parsers, is
</I>&gt;<i> actually not quite the right tool for verifying that a given grammar
</I>&gt;<i> is unambiguous.  Because it uses linear approximation, it can see
</I>&gt;<i> ambiguity where there is none.  If I'm not mistaken, using predicates
</I>&gt;<i> to work around this problem might cause ANTLR to not complain about an
</I>&gt;<i> actual ambiguity.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, I don't know of any tools which will validate a
</I>&gt;<i> grammar's unambiguity without being tied to a particular parsing
</I>&gt;<i> method.  I'm not even sure if such a thing is possible, or
</I>&gt;<i> computationally practical.  I do know that grammars can be proven
</I>&gt;<i> unambiguous by hand, through formal mathematical proof, but that's
</I>&gt;<i> rather time-consuming except for simple grammars.  If anybody knows of
</I>&gt;<i> methods for automatic validation, I'd love to hear about them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let me reiterate, before I make myself unwelcome on this list, that
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not criticizing ANTLR in the slightest.  I think it's great at
</I>&gt;<i> what it does.  I'm just wondering if it's great at what I want it to
</I>&gt;<i> do -- the right tool for the job, and all that.

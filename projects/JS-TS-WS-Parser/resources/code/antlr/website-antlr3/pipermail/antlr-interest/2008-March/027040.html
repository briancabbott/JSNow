</I>Sound like the first warning may have been due to a bug\limitation in
the older analysis code that has been fixed in the intermediate build.
The intermediate build has also elevated unreachable tokens to being
an error. You need to fix that. '&lt;' and '&gt;' (from the parser literals)
are clashing with your STRING rule. Which should it be? You do realise
that parser context does not affect the lexer and that parser literals
simply generate lexer rules right?
I think you might also want to reconsider your heavy use of states if
possible. Thats going to really complicate your lexer DFAs which may
be what's causing the first warning. You also might end up running
into code size problems and performance will be worse. Is it really
lexically ambiguous in a way you can't deal with with by generalising
the lexer tokenisation and using some setType calls in the parser? A
lot of the stuff seems to deal with things that are only keywords in
certain contexts, there are other ways to do this. See the keywords as
identifiers entry in the wiki.

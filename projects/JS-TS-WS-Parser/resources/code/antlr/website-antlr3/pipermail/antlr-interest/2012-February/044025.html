<PRE>Hi,

I am working on web project to manage all my numeric data with some 
smart relationship between them and
the first module I wanted to have is a webmail (can give you a link to 
see what it looks like if you are
intererested). This web application has been developed using a not very 
common but quite powerful web framework called cappuccino and that is a
kind of objective-C applied to javascript. If you are interested here 
is an example of Objective-J :



/// Objective J simple example
@implementation Address : CPObject
{
    CPString name;
    CPString city;
}

- (id)initWithName:(CPString)aName city:(CPString)aCity
{
     self = [super init];

     name = aName;
     city = aCity;

     return self;
}

-(void)setName:(CPString)aName
{
       name = aName;
}

-(CPString)name
{
       return name;
}

+(id)newAddressWithName:(CPString)aName city:(CPString)aCity
{
       return [[self alloc] initWithName:aName city:aCity];
}

@end

This language once parsed is transformed into javascript.


I have invested some time and money in my web application but the 
problem I see with this technology is
the fact that for the moment tools are only available on MacOs and 
linux(but on this platform you don't have access
to XCode Interface Builder so I suppose you have to declare all the ui 
by hand).
I find also that existing ide plugins misses some important feature 
like code completion (called code assistant on eclipse)
so I wanted to see if it wouldn't be possible to improve things.
I have started by evaluating javaCC that seems very good but with a 
very poor documentation and a smaller community. Good point is
there is a working objective C grammar that I was able to modify to 
parse the most simple objective j example.
Now I would like to do the same with antlr but the objective-C grammar 
I found doesn't work very well and I don't have too much
time to understand why it doesn't work. Besides now I work I don't have 
time to learn parser/compiler theory.
So I am posting here to find a developer or a student that could be 
interested by helping me in my project.
If you are interested please contact-me and we will discuss about 
payment.

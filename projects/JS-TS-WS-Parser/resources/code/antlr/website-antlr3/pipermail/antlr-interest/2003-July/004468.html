<PRE>To make a long story short, I have a personal project to add 
a &quot;replace fields with setters&quot; function to the Netbeans Java editor. 
All I want to do (at the moment) is be able to transform Java source 
code by replacing instances of 
    someIndentifier = &lt;expression&gt;; 
with 
    setSomeIndentifier(&lt;expression&gt;);
For all valid expressions.

After much experimenting with the example Java stuff in the antlr 
distribution, it seems that the original source is not stored in the 
finished AST tree. 
Accordingly, I am currently trying to augment the expression() or 
assignmentExpression() method in JavaRecognizer, but I'm stumbling 
around in the dark. I tried a method to transform the AST variable 
expression_AST back into source code by walking it and it's sub 
nodes. However:
(A) the AST tree seems to be empty for the life of these calls , and 
(B) I still can't find the original source.
I get the (sinking) feeling that I need to extend several classes, 
and use them instead of the defaults, but even after walking through 
the tutorial, I'm afraid I don't know where to start for 
JavaRecognizer and/or JavaLexer.

Any tips or pointers would be very much appreciated. 

Thank you!

Charlweed

I don't want post the grammar with the ACTION_STRING_LITERAL problem
here. If you need it I can send it off-list. I've attached my other test
grammar, though.

</I>
I didn't get any errors in the console. While looking again to be sure
that I haven't overlooked them, I somehow managed to start debugging of
the Java version. Not sure why it didn't work yesterday. But the
attached grammar isn't still recognized correctly. I end with &quot;root -&gt;
action -&gt; MismatchedTokenException&quot; and an entirely red input pane. What
goes wrong here?

Regarding remote debugging: I tried it with the C# version wihtout much
success, but not with the Java version, as I don't have parser for that.
I've tested Java.g with the same result as with the attached grammar.
But using the debug option caused it to be truncated. My non-attached
grammar was also truncated, but resulted in a different parse:

&quot; 		-&gt; MismatchedTokenException
 root -&gt; action -&gt; actionScopeName -&gt; parser
		-&gt; MismatchedTokenException&quot;

Looking at this I'm not sure if the culprit is the syntactic predicate
code, as you suggested.

Best regards,
Johannes Luber

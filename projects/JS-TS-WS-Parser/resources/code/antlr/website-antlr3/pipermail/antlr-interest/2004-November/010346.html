Does a tranforming tree parser (i.e. buildAST=true) really rebuild
every node of the tree it traverses?. Even if no explicit
transformation is specified?. I was under the impression it simply
walked it.

You don't have to (do the testing in actions/sem_preds). You could
encode the disambiguating attributes in the tree itself. Messy though.

&gt;<i> The main point is that I still want to specify the order of my

</I>
AFAIK, ANTLR's meta-langauge already supports pattern matching (on AST
structure) and substitution in tree parser grammars.

Short of additional passes, can't see how a tool like ANTLR can help
with the ordering issue. Actually, what is the issue with the ordering
of translations?

<PRE>MAJOR PROBLEMO, I think you might find ...

It's intended that Antlr should be included in commercial products. The
GPL is a no-no here. Large chunks have been contributed by people other
than Ter, and they might be licenced on terms that he is happy with, but
he doesn't have the right to relicence it.

And lastly, Antlr is a code generator. In other words, large chunks of
the stuff it generates would suddenly go GPL. MAJOR headaches for
anybody already doing as Ter wishes, and including it in a commercial
product ...

So no. The GPL would be a disaster here ...

Cheers,
Wol

Hi,

Ok, I'm not an expert, nor am I an antlr developer, so this might be a
very 
naive remark, but what if antlr is just re-released under the GPL
license? 
Wouldn't that solve the problem?

Just my 2 cents....

Kind Regards,

Hans

</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, it's not that simple.  I'll be using ANTLR primarily

Yep, I don't like the visitor mechanism as I discussed with Etienne 
and, like jjtree for javacc, I don't like generating a class per node.  
That is pretty gross.  First, people are so in love with objects that 
EVERYTHING must be a class.  It's amazing we got any work done before 
oo, right? ;)  Also, when doing translations, it is the tree structure 
that is important.  Occasionally, you need special info at particular 
nodes, but this is really just a set of attributes (mitchell is saying 
this should be a dynamic list like HashMap or something).  You do NOT 
need to make this a separate object type just to access an overridden 
method like &quot;action()&quot; because it is the action location in the grammar 
that gives you the proper &quot;event trigger&quot;.  It has context (where it 
lives in a rule) and you can have actions communicate easily whereas 
visitor actions are like &quot;incommunicato islands&quot;.  This is why Etienne 
particularly liked my dynamically-scoped attributes thingy (although I 
think I need to give Gary Funck credit; he asked for these back in my 
SORCERER days a decade ago--i think he has trouble remembering if he 
invented them).  Visitors find it VERY difficult to pass in context; 
can't use parameters, right?  You'd have to make each action method 
have the combined set of parameters you need to pass.

Anyway, I should really flesh all this out in an article--and describe 
why you need tree grammars more to get people using them.  First, I 
suppose I need to get a less buggy tree parser going ;)

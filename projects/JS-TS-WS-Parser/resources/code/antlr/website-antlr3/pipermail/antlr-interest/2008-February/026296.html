I've implemented this approach, more or less, but with additional effort
to take into account changes to the AST.

What made most sense to me was to alter the token stream to account for
the AST changes.  i.e. if I remove a method, I delete from the stream
between child.start and child.stop tokens inclusive.

Of course, CommonTree nodes store start/stop *indexes*, which will leave
lots of AST nodes with invalid indexes if was actually change the
underlying token-stream array.

My solution was to switch the token-stream from an array to a
doubly-linked list, and to replace start/stop indexes with references to
the actual token objects.  Now if a subtree is deleted, I can unlink the
appropriate sublist from the token-stream, and all remaining start/stop
references in the AST will still be valid.

It's quite a lot of effort to maintain that list of tokens, and some
things aren't as nice as I'd wish, but I can happily refactor AST
subtrees while maintaining the formatting of the rest of the file.
That includes keeping doc-comments connected to methods, etc.

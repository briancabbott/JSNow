<PRE>Hi Kunal

That's not quite correct. The @after block gets executed after matching a rule. It is not executed during syntactic predicate evaluation, or backtracking respectively. So if your @after block gets executed I think the rule must have matched. Could you give an example for reproducing your observation? Input and Rules?

Regards
Thomas

Betreff: [antlr-interest] ANTLR - Detecting if parsing was successful

Hi,
I am a new to ANTLR and have been trying to detect if the parsing was
successful or not. As of now, I was using the @after block, which gets
executed
only if the parsing was successful. But this block gets executed, even for
incorrect inputs in the language. I think I am missing something, which I
must do
to deactivate the error recovery mechanism, to avoid the after block from
being executed. Can anyone please guide me to some material on this issue.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks

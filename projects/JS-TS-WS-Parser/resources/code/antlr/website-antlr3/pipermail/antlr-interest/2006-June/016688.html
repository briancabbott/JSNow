<PRE>It may not be what you desire, but I'd use flex for scanner, and ANTLR
for everything else; this allows use of scanner states as necessary...

For ANTLR v2, lex is also much faster...

&gt;<i> Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> I am trying to use ANTLR to parse files that are mostly structured

</I>&gt;<i> parsing of the structured text can continue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem here are look-ahead tokens, where Lexer goes a bit ahead of
</I>&gt;<i> the parser and chews up input characters in advance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The places where this unstructured text appears are such that there's no
</I>&gt;<i> need to use look-ahead tokens to decide which grammar rule to apply.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I used ANTLR for some simpler things. I also used Bison and Flex before
</I>&gt;<i> and used Flex states to control grabbing characters when places with
</I>&gt;<i> unstructured text are approached. But I'm not that familiar with ANTLR
</I>&gt;<i> to know how to do it, or whether it's possible at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know if it would be possible to get the text of look-ahead
</I>&gt;<i> tokens, discard them, and force lexer to continue from a different
</I>&gt;<i> position in the input stream.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any help/hints/ideas are very much welcome.

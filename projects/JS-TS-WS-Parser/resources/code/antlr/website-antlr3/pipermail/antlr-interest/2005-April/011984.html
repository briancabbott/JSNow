<PRE>Jean,
One little question. I have seen ur videos of the ide.
There was one in which the rules tree is updated while the user is typing.
Have u tried running that on windows. I don't have much experience
with a mac but  on windows if u are gonna update and draw that fast,
then the tree is gonna flash like crazy. It almost becomes a 'blinking
tree'.

Again i don't have much experience with swing. I am using swt which
renders native widgets.
In windows thus i am having this crazy problem that gui elements need
to be rendered at a slower rate than non-gui stuff, otherwise the
entire ide begins to 'blink'.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have been reading your last e-mails with great interest because I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have similar problems in ANTLRWorks. I would like to share my comments
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about that and if you have any suggestions or comments, I would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; delighted to read them!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Currently, I have to update the following things at each keystroke:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) background parser (thread A)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) syntax coloring (thread B)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) list of all rules/tokens (thread C)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4) syntax diagram/NFA (thread D)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5) gutter information (thread E)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is not as many elements as Prashant is talking about, but this is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enough to slow down the editor depending on how you implement that. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; am currently using the following methods which doesn't slow the editor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (except when the syntax diagram is displayed - see my comments below)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; while trying to keep everything in sync as fast as possible:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) At each keystroke, I awake my parsing thread (thread A) and, if the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user doesn't press any key before a certain amount of time (let says a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; threshold of 100 ms), thread A runs. If the user presses a key before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this threshold, thread A is put back to sleep again. Because the parser
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in thread A is running fast (full parsing, not incremental), the user
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; won't notice any slow down.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) When the parsing thread A is done, it notifies the other threads (B,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; C, D and E) so they starts to work. Again, if the user presses a key
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; before a certain threshold in time, threads B, C, D and E are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cancelled. If the user pauses long enough (let say more than 500 ms),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; threads B, C, D and E will have time to complete there work and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; window will be updated.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) On thread B (syntax coloring), I have the following problem: I need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to lock the editor while the colorization is being made because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; otherwise the user can insert/delete a character and the color will not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be applied at the right place. I currently cache the previous tokens
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; list so when the new tokens list is available, I only colorize the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; modified tokens (using a fast diff comparaison). This is fast enough so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the user doesn't notice anything. But this is maybe not the best
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solution - any idea ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4) As Prashant wrote, the only time I notice a slowdown is when Swing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; updates the syntax diagram view. Because it is doing that in the events
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thread, if the display is taking too much time, the text zone will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;frozen&quot; for a few ms and the user will notice that. I didn't find a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nice way to solve that (is Swing able to update a view in another
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thread than the event thread?): I am currently caching the syntax
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; diagram in a image (in thread C) so when Swing updates the view, only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the image has to be drawn (and this is done only when the user pauses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; long enough).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In short, everything is fast and doesn't alter the edit experience of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the user except when Swing is updating part of the window. How are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other IDEs doing to update graphic elements without delaying the user
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; input ? Are they updating them in another thread than the event thread
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or is it simply a matter of speed when rendering these elements ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jean
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>

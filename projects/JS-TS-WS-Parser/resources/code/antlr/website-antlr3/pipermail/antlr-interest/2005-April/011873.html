<PRE>&gt;<i> (*) Looking forward for the update. Was afraid the plugin 
</I>&gt;<i> project was lost. I hope it will suport eclipse 3.1M6+
</I>
It supports 3.1M5, 3.1M6 and 3.0.x right now. The 3.1 support is better
though, as it takes care of classpath setup automatically ;)

&gt;<i> &gt; *However*, order of .g compilation can matter, as one grammar can 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; output token types that another grammar needs, or there could be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grammar inheritance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Point taken. Maybe this would only be recommended in case 
</I>&gt;<i> compilation order does NOT matter. (Unless antlr is changed 
</I>&gt;<i> to process the *.g files in multiple passes which is probably 
</I>&gt;<i> too much implementation work compared to the benefit).
</I>
I think most folks only have a few antlr files and probably not with cross
dependencies, so it could be done. Don't know that I'll have time for it,
though.


&gt;<i> &gt; I'd also like to set up some way to make &quot;clean&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easy, so we'll know which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; files were generated by antlr. I'm doing this in the 
</I>&gt;<i> eclipse plugin (I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; added &quot;clean&quot; support), but to do it for an ant build would require 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tracking generated files in another file, like .antlr-generated or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something. We can then have a &lt;antlr clean=&quot;yes&quot;&gt; option 
</I>&gt;<i> that removes 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any generated files. (We would have to always append to the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; .antlr-generated file to capture all renames and such until a clean)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure that I understand this. Can't the files that was 
</I>&gt;<i> generated be derived by looking at the *.g files and the 
</I>&gt;<i> arguments to the ANT task (assuming these do not change)? I 
</I>&gt;<i> generate java files to a special build\generatedsrc 
</I>&gt;<i> directory. I have no problem cleaning that. As a matter of 
</I>&gt;<i> fact I am not sure I like to have additional files generated 
</I>&gt;<i> to keep track of things if it can be avoided.
</I>
two problems
* the name of the grammar could change (I tend to do this a few times when I
first start a project)
  we would lose the names of the old generated files
* the generated files depend on the code generator and output options - we'd
have to rerun antlr to determine these

For eclipse, the plugin adds some persistent properties to the generated
files, and we use these to determine what to kill.

&gt;<i> Hope the comments are useful for you.
</I>
Definitely!

Later,
-- Scott

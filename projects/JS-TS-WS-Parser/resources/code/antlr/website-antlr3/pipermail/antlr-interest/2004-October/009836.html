I'm pretty opinionated so I'm not sure ;)

</I>
Well, thanks, but in that crowd I'm not respected much probably.  They 
have to invite me because all their grad students use ANTLR (the 
&quot;popular vote&quot;), but the academics (the &quot;electoral college&quot;) think my 
work is pure engineering. ;)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I found that I was just getting bogged down trying to keep ASTs
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in my head. I felt it was much easier to write translation rules
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in simple text as shown with the &quot;--&gt;&quot; separator above. That way,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you never even have to think about ASTs much.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do you do multiple passes or all translations in a single?  What kind
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of &quot;engine&quot; did the replacing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Multiple passes...several hundred passes in fact :)
</I>
Wow!

&gt;<i> The problem I have now is not in being able to write very
</I>&gt;<i> complex rules, it's keeping all those rules in an order
</I>&gt;<i> that works. For example, I fire the &quot;make any functions
</I>&gt;<i> that are missing a return type return 'int'&quot; rule before
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;change the 'int main()' C function to the equivalent
</I>&gt;<i> Java method&quot; rule.
</I>
Ah, yeah, sounds like order would be really important.

&gt;<i> Here's a very high-level design description:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://jazillian.com/design.html">http://jazillian.com/design.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> And here's an English description of what many of my rules
</I>&gt;<i> are doing:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://jazillian.com/how.html">http://jazillian.com/how.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be writing a complete writeup of the design in a couple

</I>
Sounds great.

I have to nail the lexing, parsing component of ANTLR 3.0 before 
proceeding to the extra goodies.  The code generator must also be 
cleaned up etc...

(turns out those were the result of weird behaviour I've been seeing 
that I can only assume is a bug; I'll report on that separately)

&gt;<i> I think that you need to start again and go a lot more slowly in 
</I>&gt;<i> building up your grammar. There is no point asking about each and every 
</I>&gt;<i> error you are getting, as you won't learn anything. Do this:
</I>
Well, I think I've been learning a lot... nowhere near every error I've 
got has come here, only the ones I've failed to trace on my own. After 
getting a pointer on a few, I've managed to fix most of the rest myself. 
I'm currently wrestling with something odd that I can't see how to 
resolve, but I'm trying to understand it myself before I ask for help. I 
apologise if I'm currently too incompetent to be worth anyone helping.

&gt;<i> 1) Do not use 'xxxx' type things in the parser rules;
</I>
I'm aware of the issues - they lead to a more readable grammar, more 
natural-feeling, and I'm pretty damn sure that they aren't causing any 
of my problems.

&gt;<i> 2) Start with a blank lexer and parser;
</I>
Well, I certainly did this time.

&gt;<i> 3) Build the parser rules for expressions, by starting with the primary 
</I>&gt;<i> elements and gradually inserting rules in the expression tree one at a 
</I>&gt;<i> time - compile and test after each rule, fix issue as soon as you see 
</I>&gt;<i> them, do not leave them to accumulate as you will get nowhere;
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Now add one parser rule at a time (you will sometimes need a few at 
</I>&gt;<i> once of course) and compile and test after each change - compile and 
</I>&gt;<i> test after each rule, fix issue as soon as you see them, do not leave 
</I>&gt;<i> them to accumulate as you will get nowhere;
</I>
Now, I'll admit I did get a bit tied up, and starting like that 
originally would have been good (and was what I was trying to do). Once 
it seemed to be going okay, I got frustrated looking between screen and 
standard so often, and let myself go too far. However, I doubt very much 
that starting again now would help. I'd just run into the remaining 
problem(s) from a different angle.

&gt;<i> The things you are seeing are standard things that happen when you start 
</I>&gt;<i> out by typing in a grammar from the normative grammar of some language 
</I>&gt;<i> spec. Such language specs are not really written with writing a parser 
</I>&gt;<i> spec in mind (most say this) and even if they are they are usually 
</I>&gt;<i> written with yacc/bison in mind. Consequently they are full of 
</I>&gt;<i> ambiguities that you must left factor as you go.
</I>
Well, I didn't just blindly copy them out, although I'll admit I got 
tied up in left-recursion issues. The grammar actually seems to have 
some ambiguities that would be ambiguous anywhere, actually, which is a 
pain in the neck, by c'est la vie.

I also didn't want to refactor it anymore than necessary because there 
is a relationship between the structure of rules in the standard and the 
semantic structure, which should help at later stages.

&gt;<i> Unless you have built a lot of grammars, that is why you need to do this 
</I>&gt;<i> in small steps - otherwise you will end up turning on backtracking and 
</I>&gt;<i> adorning the grammar with predicates that include entire rules such as 
</I>&gt;<i> (typeWithConstraint)=&gt; when the real issue is that you have not left 
</I>&gt;<i> factored the grammar correctly.
</I>
Oop, thanks for that one, I'd missed that when I was removing 
unnecessary predicates that were exploratory.

&gt;<i> Get a copy of the book if you can, it will help a lot, and read through 
</I>&gt;<i> as much of the Wiki as you can before your fingers itch to get back at 
</I>&gt;<i> the keyboard.
</I>
Got the book. Read it, in fact. Also have a good mark on languages &amp; 
compilers from my undergrad days, but that doesn't really mean anything.
Read a lot of the wiki, which seems to largely have a more judgemental 
tone than the book, but read a lot of it anyway.

In case you're interested, and by way of demonstrating that I am making 
progress, the current state of the grammar is attached. Only one error 
stopping it compiling, and one non-breaking warning that I will want to 
fix before using this for anything.

<PRE>&gt;<i> The syntax diagram is an &quot;analysis&quot; pane rather than an 
</I>&gt;<i> editing pane, so it need not be updated as the user 
</I>&gt;<i> types--when I'm typing, I'm not concerned with analysis.
</I>
Many people are. As long as it can be updated w/o disruption, I'd say do it.
There will be points where you can't update (syntax is incomplete), but if
there are two views on a single model, the user shouldn't have to guess if
they're in sync...

If the diagram is meant as &quot;once in a while analysis&quot;, it should be a
separate dialog, not a view. Views (as in model VIEW controller) are meant
to stay in sync with a model.

&gt;<i> I'd 
</I>&gt;<i> suggest update on events which change the editing screen 
</I>&gt;<i> significantly--navigating to another part of the text, for 
</I>&gt;<i> example, or mouse events in general (one hand off of the 
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard).
</I>
Those are a good start; I'd suggest adding rule completion (semicolon) as
well.

HOWEVER, what if someone removes a rule ref:

old:

    foo: fee fie fo;

new:

    foo: fee fo;

If they don't jump somewhere else, this should still update the diagram. The
question is, when.

Using a timeout is quite reasonable.

&gt;<i> John Mitchell's comment on separators is a good 
</I>&gt;<i> one--I like having the editor flash matching parentheses and 
</I>&gt;<i> braces if you pause after hitting a close parenthesis or 
</I>&gt;<i> brace.  Pause after semicolon is another good update 
</I>&gt;<i> point--when I do that, I have usually paused to think.
</I>
BTW: check out what Eclipse does with parens. It draws a little box around
matching parens, no flashing. Not distracting, but also the visualization is
right there if you need it.

&gt;<i> I also find it unsettling when an application decides to 
</I>&gt;<i> update the screen with a very slow update operation just 
</I>&gt;<i> because I've paused for a few seconds--all too often I have 
</I>&gt;<i> just gotten my hands back in a typing position when that happens.
</I>
Agreed, but that's no reason not to do updates; that's reason to do highly
optimized or incremental updates, which of course leads us right back to the
initial question...

And my answer is they are useful. I and pretty much everyone I work with
really appreciate the instant feedback. (The one exception is a VI
dinosaur... If any of you are VI users, too bad. Nyah... ;)

Later,
-- Scott

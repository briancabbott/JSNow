<PRE>One tiny thing that could really go a long way is to change the wording of
getType() currently used. In C# GetType() is an object member, so having
that there unmodified means these two names only differ by case. This means
it isn't CLS compliant (some languages aren't case sensitive, like VB). This
means that while you can black box call the antlr.runtime.dll, but you can't
do things like subclass AST for example, which otherwise you could. So other
languages can only use grammars already created, they can't really use antlr
itself.

I know it isn't that big a deal to work around once you know your way around
antlr, but it is a pretty intimidating first step to have to take. After
that, you still have things like java naming conventions/styles that make
things a bit akward, it might be nice if all that was abstracted somehow and
could be set per language  (as per this conversation I know).

Cheers,
Robin

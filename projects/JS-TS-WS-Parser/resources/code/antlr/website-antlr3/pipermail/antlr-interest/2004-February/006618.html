It's LL(1) 'cept for the optional commas and semis, which require k=2.

&gt;<i> As far as the commas and Python, I presume you are talking about tuple

</I>&gt;<i> newline)?
</I>
Stuff like that and

a=1; b=2;

and

foo(1,3,)

that's just wrong in my book, but I'm a language implementor not 
designer ;)

</I>&gt;<i> One of the reasons that I chose antlr is that I have heard that Python

</I>&gt;<i> help?
</I>
Well, a few people are playing around.  We have a python generator that 
works with jython, but nobody has translated the libraries to python 
yet.  I'm madly learning python as fast as I can ;)

&gt;<i> I'll gladly test it out.  I tried out several different Python parsers
</I>
Should be something in the file sharing area you can try out.

&gt;<i> (LR/LALR) for some work projects, but the debugging information they 
</I>&gt;<i> provided
</I>&gt;<i> made them nearly useless so I ended up writing them by hand.  I

</I>&gt;<i> support.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Nice language, python....just a little kinky lexically. ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh yeah.  I still have to get used to the lexer parsing structure and

</I>&gt;<i> point.  I
</I>&gt;<i> suppose then that it wasn't the grammar that was giving you 
</I>&gt;<i> problems....
</I>
Nope...grammar is autotranslated from distribution.  The lexer is 
totally nasty with context-sensitive whitespace etc...  For example, 
NEWLINE must be sent to the parser as it is statement separate etc..., 
but inside (...), [...], {...} whitespace indentation and newlines are 
totally ignored and not sent to the parser.

&gt;<i> Thanks for the feedback and the tool.  I really like how I can look at 
</I>&gt;<i> LA(k)
</I>&gt;<i> and FIRST(set).  They make it really easy to handle things that were
</I>&gt;<i> previously much more difficult.

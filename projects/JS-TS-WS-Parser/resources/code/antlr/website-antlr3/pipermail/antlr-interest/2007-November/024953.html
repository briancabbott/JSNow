<PRE>Hi there,
If you've been on the list for a while (or read the Wiki), you know me --
I've been working with ANTLR for quite a while and know it pretty well. When
I can, I answer questions here and write little tutorials for the wiki.
 I've been quiet of late with a new job that has me swamped and my team may
be looking for one or more contract developers to take over part of the
work.

One of the jobs is we're using ANTLR and StringTemplate to parse XHTML and
emit properly formed Word 2007 documents inside a Java web application. The
whole thing is tiny -- about 250 lines in ANTLR, plus a little glue code and
the output templates (around 150 lines) -- and written in about 2 weeks.

We've made a bunch of simplifying decisions (we control the incoming XHTML
too), so it's basically an internal tool for a specific client's needs.
There's a chance this internal tool may get expanded into a full commercial
product, but my attention is required elsewhere, so I'm starting to fish
around for help. I'd like to recommend one or two contractors to the team.

If you're interested, or curious, please drop me a line at
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">rclark at intrepidls.com</A> (not here on the list or gmail, as I'm not reading it
very often right now.) I don't have work to give out immediately, but want
to have some options on hand when my manager needs me to go back to my
primary job as an instructional systems architect.

Thanks,

 ...Richard

P.S. If you're wise in the ways of ANTLR 2.x, I also have some legacy code
that needs maintaining and upgrading.

Yes, i have been working with this cool start-up company recently and  
I have been trying to use the template stuff.  I have not needed  
multiple templates from a single rule, but let me add my own  
frustrations here and we can probably come up with a nice bit of  
extension.  John Mitchell suggested this exact strategy...get  
something working (avoiding the complicated thing I was designing)  
and then try to build something with it! ;)

So, I do this a few times in a Java grammar:

StringTemplate fcallST = templateLib.getInstanceOf(&quot;fcall&quot;);
fcallST.setAttribute(&quot;ids&quot;, $type.st);  // type is a rule reference  
above
$anEnclosingTemplateVisibleHere.setAttribute(&quot;fcalls&quot;,fcallST);

Wouldn't it be nice to do as you say (a rewrite like constructor but  
in an action):

StringTemplate fcallST = $fcall(ids=$type.st);

and then we could have a syntax like pyStringTemplate to use array  
syntax instead of setAttribute:

$anEnclosingTemplateVisibleHere[&quot;fcalls&quot;] = fcallST;

The problem of course is clear: The dollar syntax $x.y is way to  
simple to handle the above and it's ambiguous anyway.  We'd need a  
keyword as you say I think, but that makes it messy.

&lt;sidetracked&gt;
Actually, given that I must be consistent across output options, how  
will we build trees inline?

{AST t = ^($ID.text, $INT.text);}

I suppose we could make ^ significant like we did with #(...)  
before.  Hmm...What would a node constructor be?

^ID[&quot;blort]

I suppose that would be ok.
&lt;/sidetracked&gt;

So, do we need a special symbol for inline stringtemplate stuff?   
Ick.  @ is action, $ is attribute.  Hm...keyword is probably better.   
Ack...can't just randomly look for a keyword...need a symbol.   
Hmm...well, what about, symbol plus braces:

StringTemplate fcallST = ${fcall(ids=$type.st)};
${anEnclosingTemplateVisibleHere[&quot;fcalls&quot;] = fcallST};

I don't like overloading $ though but I hate to create another  
special symbol just for templates like:

StringTemplate fcallST = %{fcall(ids=$type.st)}
%{anEnclosingTemplateVisibleHere[&quot;fcalls&quot;] = fcallST};

Is there some generic thing I could do with %{...}?  Ick.  Would they  
have to nest?

%{anEnclosingTemplateVisibleHere[&quot;fcalls&quot;] = %{fcall(ids=$type.st)}};

Probably.  To me that is not very readable to the casual observer  
where the explicit is very readable.

Perhaps your $templates::fcall(ids=$type.st) would work with  
&quot;templates&quot; being the keyword / built-in scope of templates.   
Actually that would work. :)

StringTemplate fcallST = $templates::fcall(ids=$type.st);
$anEnclosingTemplateVisibleHere.setAttribute(&quot;fcalls&quot;,fcallST);

It saves a bit of typing and is more clear. :)

&gt;<i> Better yet: How about defining a string template group in the
</I>&gt;<i> grammar:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> group MyTemplates;  // This only a defines a property in the parser  
</I>&gt;<i> to set a
</I>&gt;<i> string template group. Later, we could allow to define the  
</I>&gt;<i> templates inline.
</I>
I think you want this to be dynamic so, as you request below, you can  
reset the template group for each pass using setTemplateLib().

&gt;<i> Then one could call templates of the group using a syntax like
</I>&gt;<i> MyTemplates::Name. There would be a default group, which is used if  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> group name is omitted.
</I>
We can just use the $templates::name(...) generic mechanism so we can  
dynamically change the actual group.  Your way might be useful with  
the ST interface I plan on implementing.  In this way, I could verify  
that your template names actually make sense.  Heh, i like it!

&gt;<i> -&gt; xxx  calls default group &quot;xxx&quot; and returns this as result
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; MyTemplates::xxx calls &quot;xxx&quot; in the the MyTemplates group and  
</I>&gt;<i> returns
</I>&gt;<i> this as result.
</I>
Interesting.  You want to be able to define multiple template  
libraries?  Ok, so

$templates::fcall(...)
$MyTemplates::blort(...)

I dislike overriding the $scope::x syntax so much, but it seems like  
it would work.  How would we specify the new template groups?

templates Java;
templates Debug;

then you could say $Java::fcall(...) and $Debug::dump(...).  But, the  
lib names should be interfaces so you're not locked into a specific  
template group, right?  This would generate methods like:

setJavaTemplateLib(...)

in the parser so you could set the actual lib.

How often would this multiple template lib thing be used do you think?

&gt;<i> Within actions $MyTemplates::xxx would call the template.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, we could nest them:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; ResultTemplate(MyTemplates::xxx($Name), MyTemplates::yyy($Id)), or
</I>&gt;<i> whatever...
</I>
Yup.

Oh, right we'd need to allow

-&gt; Java::fcall(...)

syntax too.

&gt;<i> 2) Build a collection of templates. These are useful to pass them  
</I>&gt;<i> to other
</I>&gt;<i> templates...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, only the result of a rule can be added to a list. This  
</I>&gt;<i> could be
</I>&gt;<i> expanded to support multiple lists, one per template.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just allow the same syntax to be used in front of each template call:
</I>&gt;<i> myList+=MyTemplates::xxx adds the template to a list called myList.
</I>
Is that in an action?  You can pass in multiple templates to fill  
with templates you create in that rule.  You can pass multiple return  
values back and just add to a list manually.  How often do you need  
to return multiple templates though?  When I need this I just access  
the outer template where they will go and then setAttribute for each  
new template.  I've yet to need multiple return templates.

&gt;<i> Maybe we should add the possibility to define lists in a scope:
</I>&gt;<i> scope global {
</I>&gt;<i> Templatecollection myList;  // or something like that
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Use it like this: global::myList+=MyTemplates::xxx(...).
</I>
We're getting closer and closer to the simple neutral action language  
I was thinking of adding later ;)  Hm...this is getting a big much. I  
think:

global::myList.add($MyTemplates::xxx());

would be just as good ;)

&gt;<i> Overall, I think, template manipulation within ANTLR should be  
</I>&gt;<i> expanded. Of
</I>
I plan on it...just trying to let actual need guide us. :)

&gt;<i> course, I can code that now within actions but it would be far more  
</I>&gt;<i> user
</I>&gt;<i> friendly if normal cases could be expressed in a standard and  
</I>&gt;<i> uniform way.
</I>
Yes, let's come up with a nice extension.

&gt;<i> I have several 2.7.5 grammars in C# and Java, which only differs in  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> action code because of different method and class names. Using  
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR 3 with
</I>&gt;<i> templates I was hoping to move all differences to a set of  
</I>&gt;<i> templates. This
</I>&gt;<i> only works if templates can be manipulated within ANTLR itself.
</I>
Can't you just a different template group with setTemplateLib?

&gt;<i> Kind regards
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW: I was thinking about using multiple passes using the same  
</I>&gt;<i> action code,
</I>&gt;<i> but using different template groups for each pass...
</I>
Are you using setTemplateLib?

Let me add my own frustrations now.

This is a drag:

packageDefinition
	:	'package' identifier SEMI -&gt; {$identifier.st}
	;

Could we do this?

packageDefinition
	:	'package' identifier SEMI -&gt; identifier
	;

What if we always returned the template for a single element?

type
	:	identifier
	|	builtInType
	;

the template for identifier / builtInType would be autocopied to  
$type.st return value.  I don't like this actually... it's not  
consistent with having multiple elements in a production.  Perhaps

type
	:	identifier -&gt; identifier
	|	builtInType
	;

is &quot;better&quot;.  Weird looking though.

Here is a case where I might have just plain foo instead of a.b.c.   
In either case I need to set the return type.  I hate doing ( x -&gt;  
template(...) ) syntax in the middle of a rule.  I want that -&gt; on  
the end!  Here is what I do now:

identifier
	:	(i=IDENT -&gt; qid(id={$i.text}))
		( DOT i=IDENT {$identifier.st.setAttribute(&quot;id&quot;,$i.text);} )*
	;

Oh, actually we can do this properly even now.  Duh, just queue up  
the IDs.

identifier
	:	ids+=IDENT ( DOT ids+=IDENT )*
                 -&gt; qid(id={toStrings($ids)})
	;

I've posted this to the blog too.

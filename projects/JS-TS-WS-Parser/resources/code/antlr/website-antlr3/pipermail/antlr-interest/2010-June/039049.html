<PRE>Hi Mark,

thanks for your quick reply. I think that I already removed the left recursive rules by replacing them with iterations (Kleene operator '*') if possible or by using ANTLRWork's refactoring. However, it may be that there are still some Multi Line Recursive rules left. Further details are available here: <A HREF="http://community.ingres.com/wiki/Ingres_Migration_Tool_Set_Idiom_MySQL#MySQL_grammar_from_YACC_to_ANTLR">http://community.ingres.com/wiki/Ingres_Migration_Tool_Set_Idiom_MySQL#MySQL_grammar_from_YACC_to_ANTLR</A> .

I also already increased the timeout to 2 minutes and assigned 1GB of RAM to the JVM in which the code generation happens. The result was an Out Of Memory message. So I am not sure but maybe there is as you pointed out still a Multi Line left recursion in my grammar which causes that the Look Ahead DFA creation comes never to an end. Could that be?

Regards, David

Hi David,

Often with larger grammars it is necessary to increse the timeout and
to increase the Java VM heap size.

I am not sure about the other problems.

Just to state the obvious though: since Yacc will happilly accept
left recursive grammars, while as ANTLR will not, it is necessary
to remove any left recursion from the grammar.  A good description
of how to do that is on p.129 of the book &quot;Modern Compiler Design&quot;
by Grune, et. al.  There is also a description in the dragon book,
I like the description in Modern Compiler Design better for this
task though.  Presumably there are other descriptions for
left recursion removal.

Regards, Mark

&gt;<i> * Did set k=1, which helps to avoid the error message but introduces limitations regarding the look ahead and so causes new problems
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I think the right solution will be to remove ambiguous rules. I already began to remove 'Epsilon' rules and I can imagine that there are other ambiguous rules in the grammar as well. The problem I have is to find them easily. So the error message above contains the decision number &lt;n&gt;. Is it easily possible to find the rule in my grammar's source code which is related to this decision number &lt;n&gt;? How to do that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another idea would be to implement an algorithm which starts at a single token definition and creates a tree by substituting the rules back. The idea is that a rule is ambiguous if it is part of 2 different paths in this tree. So for instance:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> rule1: rule2 | rule3;
</I>&gt;<i> rule2: TOKEN1;
</I>&gt;<i> rule3: rule4 | rule5;  
</I>&gt;<i> rule4: TOKEN1;
</I>&gt;<i> rule5: TOKEN2;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> would result in the following tree for TOKEN1:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> TOKEN1 -&gt; rule2 -&gt; rule1;
</I>&gt;<i>        -&gt; rul4 -&gt; rule3 -&gt; rule1;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am wondering if there is already such a tool available to find ambiguous rules, is there?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BTW: Future information can be found here: <A HREF="http://community.ingres.com/wiki/Ingres_Migration_Tool_Set_Idiom_MySQL">http://community.ingres.com/wiki/Ingres_Migration_Tool_Set_Idiom_MySQL</A>

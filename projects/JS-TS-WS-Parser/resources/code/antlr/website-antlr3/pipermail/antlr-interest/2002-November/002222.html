<PRE>Hello,

	I'm very sorry to be posting so many questions, I'm afraid I
have another.  I'd also like to thank the people who have responded to
me!

	I'm looking to obtain column and line information for the
parser.  I have line information sorted out but am confused with the
column identification.  Looking at the jdocs for the antlr package
(2.7.0), the Token class has a getter/setter for Column.  However
calling this just results in a zero.  

	Looking at the docs on the antlr documentation page, they seem
to be out of date with my version as it talks about overriding consume
and providing a getColumn method.  
	The getColumn method is already there and looking at the FAQ
asking the same thing - it says - 'do not override consume'.  
	There is a comment later that I need to provide the input stream
in binary mode.  Therefore I have created a FileInputStream which
obtains a stream of bytes and sent this in but to no avail the column
number still sits at one. 

	These conflicting statements have confused me slightly - please
could you let me know the best way to provide column information on the
location of a token.

	Thanks, once again for your assistance.

Cheers,

Neil Benn

<PRE>I hope you didn't think I was suggesting that your work (or Johannes' work)
is lagging TParr.  Quite the opposite.  It's amazing how well you guys have
mind-melded.  And I recognize from my own work elsewhere the almost
super-human effort that requires.  &quot;Thank you.&quot;  You contributors don't hear
that nearly enough here.

You've just about talked me out of IKVM.  I need to ponder it more.  Thank
you.

And you make an excellent point about the C# target being ahead of Java in
some aspects.

Although I failed to say so, my desire to sync with TParr (or at least have
the option) is stability.  I'm not interested in chasing the latest
pre-release features.  But I am interested in getting the latest fixes.  So
even if the C# target gets &quot;ahead&quot; of the Java reference, I would probably
not use the C# enhancements until they were cross-ported to Java anyway.

Thanks and congratulations to all of you who make this amazing tool work for
so many more of us.

C. Mundi

</I>&gt;<i> Here at our office we use Perforce internally, but we're not in a position

</I>&gt;<i> work on the C# ports so people have access to both the code and binaries. I
</I>&gt;<i> use ANTLR extensively in some commercial C# products, so keeping up to date
</I>&gt;<i> isn't really the problem. Actually, there are a significant number of
</I>&gt;<i> changes in the C# port that haven't made it back to the Java version yet,
</I>&gt;<i> such as the use of v3 grammars.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been hesitant to just package up the current source because I'll be
</I>&gt;<i> making a number of breaking changes as I continue working. Two examples are
</I>&gt;<i> the continued move from get/set functions to properties, and making function
</I>&gt;<i> names start with a capital letter. I'll try and get a new set of binaries
</I>&gt;<i> and an updated version of nFringe's ANTLR language module posted next week.
</I>&gt;<i> I've made a few tweaks to the Visual Studio support since the last post.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been asking myself what I would do if I needed to target parsers for
</I>&gt;<i> .NET *and* needed to stay current with the latest from TParr.  This is not
</I>&gt;<i> a troll.  It's a serious issue for me.  I've Googled a fair bit of
</I>&gt;<i> misinformation.  So I've concluded that I should just ask the people who
</I>&gt;<i> know best, who logically are among you who frequent this list.  And I seem
</I>&gt;<i> to recall seeing some discussion of this months ago, before I appreciated
</I>&gt;<i> its significance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm very impressed with the C# target and the recent work to port the antlr
</I>&gt;<i> tool to Visual Studio.  It's really amazing.  It also seems like an enormous
</I>&gt;<i> effort for these projects to keep up with TParr's prodigious pace.  So I was
</I>&gt;<i> wondering what my experience might be like if I stuck to the &quot;reference&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Java target and used IKVM.NET to re-target my parser's Java bytecode to
</I>&gt;<i> the CLI.  I have every intention of trying this out, but first I thought of
</I>&gt;<i> some obvious pros and cons:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pro: meets requirement of staying up-to-the-minute with TParr
</I>&gt;<i> Pro: meets requirement of targeting .net
</I>&gt;<i> Pro: allows access to arbitrary .net via java stubs created from
</I>&gt;<i> assemblies, pretty cool but not required
</I>&gt;<i> Pro: gives me an excuse to use java for real after all these years  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Con: adds another step to the build-chain, i.e. dependence on the stability
</I>&gt;<i> of javac; maybe academic, but listed for completeness
</I>&gt;<i> Con: at the mercy of the quality of ikvmc -- debugging is ugly if tests
</I>&gt;<i> pass in java but fail in .net
</I>&gt;<i> Con: possibly slow runtime performance -- I have to believe that the C#
</I>&gt;<i> target is able to do more optimization than the two-step Java --&gt; Bytecode
</I>&gt;<i> --&gt; CIL process
</I>&gt;<i> Con: hours lost cursing classpath  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the con's might be mitigated by runtime profiling in combination
</I>&gt;<i> with decompiling the CIL, but any hand-tuning on the .NET side would be hard
</I>&gt;<i> to maintain unless accepted by the upstream ikvm developers, which might not
</I>&gt;<i> be practical anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These observations may be naive.  I'm interested in what the experts here
</I>&gt;<i> have to say about what I should be prepared to face if I go this route.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is in no way a comment on the incredible work discussed regularly on
</I>&gt;<i> this list.  My requirements might push me in a slightly different direction,
</I>&gt;<i> is all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I have to believe that some of you have tried ikvm or are using it and
</I>&gt;<i> already know a lot that I need to learn.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> C. Mundi

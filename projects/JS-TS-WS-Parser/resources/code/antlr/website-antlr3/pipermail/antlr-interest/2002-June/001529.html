There's no reason you couldn't put the preprocessing junk in at the end,
right?  I mean if you are radically changing the code then they can expect
things to change.  Maybe you can take the transformed tree and then start
some pattern matching to insert macros where appropriate.  You could use
original invocations of the macros to have a pattern to match against.  This
might make for a good (somewhat) interactive step at the end.  You get a
chance to refactor the code via macros since the language doesn't support
objects or whatnot.

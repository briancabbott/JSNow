The point is that in this case, the tree walker isn't &quot;guiding general 
output generation&quot;. Yes,
the &quot;check-for-missing-return logic kicks in at each 
Function-declaration-type node in the tree,
but there's a lot of code there, and I don't really see the benefit of 
it being inside of a treewalker.
With the treewalker, you are grouping together the 100 rules that all 
happen to kick in
at a Function-declaration-type node in the tree, at that's not the best 
way to group them.

&gt;<i>You  
</I>&gt;<i>must compute it, period, right?  Use a tree, use a flow graph, use  
</I>&gt;<i>flat text, up to you.  Once you have a result to spit out (i.e,. &quot;add  
</I>&gt;<i>a return statement or not&quot;), you can use ST to say that.  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>As I say in the article, it's almost never that simple. In the case of a 
missing return, I also go
look at all the calls to the function and if the return value is ever 
used, I give a warning, because I
really don't know what value to return. Also, if the function is the 
special &quot;main&quot; function, I need to
do a System.exit() rather than a return.


&gt;<i>ST has  
</I>&gt;<i>nothing to do with that.  The tree walker merely guides general  
</I>&gt;<i>output generation...it would reference a previous pass over the input  
</I>&gt;<i>that computed the flow analysis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Why not just compute the flow analysis as needed?

My general objection to the tree walker is that I don't see it as 
&quot;guiding general output generation&quot;, but
rather as &quot;embedding calls to the code that does all the work at 
arbitrary places in a parser grammar
amidst ANTLR syntax.&quot;

I'd rather have code that says &quot;Here are my 200 rules, in the order they 
should fire&quot;. That seems like
the better way to &quot;guide output generation&quot;.

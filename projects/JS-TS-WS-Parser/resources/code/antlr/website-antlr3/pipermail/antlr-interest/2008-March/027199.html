That poster was me.  To give Andy some details, my translator reads  
~1250 files written in an abstract language called MOF and writes  
~1250 Java files.  MOF is Managed Object Format, a language used to  
define the Common Information Model, which is a object-oriented  
standard for representing computers and networks.  The Common  
Information Model is defined by the Distributed Management Task  
Force.  The MOF files are available at <A HREF="http://www.dmtf.org/standards/">http://www.dmtf.org/standards/</A> 
cim/cim_schema_v2171/.  The DMTF wanted to define an object-oriented  
model while staying language-agnostic, so they use MOF.  MOF isn't  
wildly different than Java, hence my translator qualifies as  
&quot;trivial&quot; as Loring defined trivial:

&quot;Trivial translations--A source to B source for languages in which  
language B can straightforwardly express the paradigms of language A-- 
can be done without intermediate analysis.  Even there, an AST is  
helpful and aids maintainability.&quot;

Perhaps the negative connotation of the word &quot;trivial&quot; has made this  
into more of an argument than it's worth.  At first I assumed that  
&quot;trivial&quot; meant &quot;small&quot; or &quot;for teaching purposes&quot; or something. My  
translator seems nontrivial to me.  The grammar has ~900 lines, yet  
no AST.  I built it by reading the ANTLR book, learning as I went,  
and didn't encounter a need for an AST.  Others might have a similar  
experience, so I posted to learn why ASTs should be used.  As a  
result of this thread, I now think an AST might improve my translator  
somewhat.  I plan to add one to get separation-of-concerns and to  
perhaps discover the &quot;helpful and aids maintainability&quot; benefits that  
Loring mentioned.

So Andy, I hope you aren't still bugged by this, but I remain  
unconvinced that every useful (nontrivial) translation needs an AST.

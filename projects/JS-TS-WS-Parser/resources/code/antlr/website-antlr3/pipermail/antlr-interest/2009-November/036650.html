This wasn't a very helpful question. See
&lt;<A HREF="http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html</A>&gt;. In any case,

 - First fix all missing rules (e.g. NOT, FILE, IN, COLON, and COMMA).
   There's no point trying to debug anything else while you have missing
   rule references. If you use ANTLRWorks, it will underline these
   references in red.

 - Parser rule names must start with a lowercase letter, and lexer
   rules with an uppercase letter. For example, change &lt;Argument&gt; to
   &lt;argument&gt;.

 - Change *every* quoted token (e.g. 'IF') to a separate lexer rule.
   This includes each quoted token in lexer rules such as &lt;NRelOp&gt;
   (which will have to become parser rules), including operators.

   This might seem like a lot of extra rules, but if you don't make this
   change, it will just cause more obscure errors. Also, typically you
   want each operator to be treated as a different token in code that
   uses the parser.

   Note that since the set of tokens matched by OBJNAME overlaps
   keywords such as 'IF', OBJNAME has to be defined later in the
   grammar file than the lexer rules for those keywords (assuming that
   keywords are not context-dependent in the language you're parsing).

 - You have no rule for whitespace or line terminators. Such a rule
   might look something like

     WS : (' '|'\t'|'\n'|'\r')+ { $channel = HIDDEN; };

   Also, you have tokens that include whitespace such as 'IS MISSING'.
   Here 'IS' and 'MISSING' should be separate tokens, where &lt;relOp&gt; has
   (IS MISSING) as an alternative.

 - The definition of &lt;SingleStringLiteral&gt; is strange; it doesn't correspond
   to its name. You probably want fragment rules &lt;SingleStringLiteral&gt; and
   &lt;DoubleStringLiteral&gt;, and &lt;StringLiteral&gt; to be a non-fragment rule
   defined with those as alternatives. Then change uses of
   &lt;SingleStringLiteral&gt; to &lt;StringLiteral&gt;.

 - You have rules, such as FUNCTION : OBJNAME '('; and
   PREFIX : OBJNAME '.';, that put what would normally be considered
   separate tokens into a single token.

   This is *probably* trying to do too much in the lexer. It might be
   correct if the language does not allow whitespace between OBJNAME and
   '(' or '.', but if it does allow whitespace there, then you should
   make these parser rules and treat '(' and '.' as tokens.

 - Your grammar needs a start rule, which should match EOF after whatever
   else it matches (probably &lt;expression&gt;).

 - Simplify the grammar by factoring common sets of alternatives.
   For example, the set of alternatives 'numerical_expression |
   alphanumerical_expression | function | data_field' occurs several
   times, and can be replaced in each case with 'value'. That will
   make it easier to see other possible simplifications, for example
   the expression following 'ELSE' can be written just as 'expression'.

   Avoid parser rules that just repeat a lexer rule (such as
   'alphanumerical_relational_op : ARelOp'); they're not helpful.
   Also remove redundant parentheses, for instance '(NOT? value IN)'
   or '(numExprA)' do not need parentheses.

   [Such simplifications can make it easier to see what is going on in
   the next steps.]

 - You might want to rename rules that are misleadingly or inconsistently
   named; for example, &lt;value&gt; is a type of expression, so I would suggest
   calling it &lt;value_expression&gt;.

 - Before trying to resolve more complicated errors and warnings, make
   sure that your grammar is showing &quot;green&quot; in ANTLRWorks, i.e. it has
   no syntax errors, no missing rule references, etc.

 - You have some rules that are not left-factored. For example, consider
   the rule

     argument : value_expression relational_operator value_expression
              | NOT? value_expression IN ...;

   When the NOT is absent, the alternatives both start with
   &lt;value_expression&gt;, so the rule needs to be left-factored as follows:

     argument : value_expression ( relational_operator value_expression
                                 | IN ... )
              | NOT value_expression IN ...;

   (Left-factoring sometimes, as in this case, introduces repetition,
   which is ugly and error-prone. You could reduce the repetition by
   adding a parser rule for the repeated part, shown as '...' here.)

 - Now there are some ambiguities to be resolved. For example, in

     relational_operator : relOp | aRelOp | numerical_relational_op ;

     numerical_relational_op : nRelOp numerical_expression TO ;

   &lt;nRelOp&gt; is ambiguous with &lt;relOp&gt;, since both include 'ISFROM'.
   The fix for this depends on how 'ISFROM' should be interpreted when
   it is not followed by a &lt;numerical_expression&gt; and 'TO' (if I had
   to guess, I'd say that its inclusion in &lt;relOp&gt; is probably an error).

   There are a couple of more complicated ambiguities in this grammar
   surrounding argument lists. Consider the input

     ( 1 )

   matched by the &lt;arguments&gt; rule: is it a parenthesized
   &lt;numerical_expression&gt;, or a parenthesized &lt;arguments&gt;? This
   appears to be a genuine ambiguity (as opposed to one caused only
   by the requirement for left-factoring in an LL grammar).

   If you want it to be resolved in favour of parenthesized
   &lt;arguments&gt;, for example, that would be:

     arguments : { input.LA(1) == LPAREN }? LPAREN arguments RPAREN
               | argument ((OR | AND) argument)* ;

   [LPAREN is the token for '('. This is another reason why you always
   want to define lexer rules for each token; &quot;input.LA(1) == '('&quot; would
   not work.]

   Here's another genuine ambiguity:

     1 AND 2

   Is this an &lt;arguments&gt; list with arguments 1 and 2, or with a
   single argument that is a &lt;numerical_expression&gt; using the 'AND'
   operator?

   Removing 'AND' and 'OR' from the numeric operators resolves this
   ambiguity, although that might not be the correct solution.

   (I think the underlying problem is that the syntax of argument lists
   in this language is rather poorly thought out, although you might
   not be able to do anything about that.)

 - Once you have a grammar that compiles without errors or warnings
   (don't ignore warnings), you can look for possible mistakes that
   might be causing it to parse the wrong language. In particular,
   some rules appear suspiciously restrictive. For instance

     numerical_expression : NumericLiteral (numOp NumericLiteral)+
                          | LPAREN numerical_expression RPAREN ;

   does not allow numeric expressions such as '(1+2)+(3+4)', or
   even '(1)+1' -- was that intended? The following would be less
   restrictive and more similar to other languages:

     primary_expression   : NumericLiteral
                          | LPAREN numerical_expression RPAREN ;

     numerical_expression : primary_expression (numOp primary_expression)*;

   (This follows a pattern called an &quot;operator precedence grammar&quot;,
   where a parser rule is created for each level of expression
   precedence. Of course, your language might actually be broken
   enough not to accept such expressions.)

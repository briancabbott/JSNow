<PRE>For Yggdrasil, I hide the sempred&#160;behind doubly-quoted keywords.&#160; As to performance:&#160; the sempred is called less often than id (as a rule--YMMV) and usually much less often.&#160; The issue is aggregate performance, not local performance; the general principle for performance tweaking&#160;is to worry less about the cost of infrequent calls than the cost of frequent calls.&#160; Basically, the id approach adds a method call and bitset inclusion test for every ID, while the sempred costs the three calls per keyword test.

That is one solution; however, semantic predicates-- { input.LT(1).getText().equals(&quot;foo&quot;) }? ID --are much to be preferred when there are lots of potential keywords and cost less in terms of performance since they avoid the id method call for the general case.&#160; (Or should cost less:&#160; ANTLR 3 currently does not reduce the generated conditionals.)

Personally I think that that construct is almost unreadable and it involves invoking LT(), getText() - which means creating the string out of the input stream, then a string comparison, which is another method call in itself. I can't see how that will cost less than looking for a token value as it invokes three method calls. Java doesn't seem to do a great job of optimizing conditionals, but it should be able to do better than two method calls, constructing a string via substring and a string comparison I should think? I would also think that the DFA is faster than that construct. 

My preference is based upon the observed performance of C I admit, where the keywords rule is a much better performer (though I might go recheck that to make sure ;-). Maybe the opposite is indeed true for Java.

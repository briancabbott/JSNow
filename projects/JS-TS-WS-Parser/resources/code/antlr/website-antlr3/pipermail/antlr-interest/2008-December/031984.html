<PRE>I am new to antlr and I need some help with using it in C/C++.

I already created a grammar that I want to use and tested it with
antlr-works, and then I generated the C files from it.

Now I need to write a program that uses the parser, and unfortunately it
is far from obvious of how do I even start. I tried to find help in the
documentation, and I tried to guess by looking at the generated files.

I expect that it should be pretty much straightforward, so I need a
simple example.

I understand that basically I need to do the following:

1. Prepare the text to be parsed. In my case it will be a text string in
memory (not a disk file). Should it be just a &quot;const char *&quot;? 

2. Invoke a call to the parser and pass my string to it. How does it
look like? How do I get back the status code and the parsing errors?

3. Get the tree root. How?

4. Walk through the tree. Need an example how this is done. On each node
I will need to figure out what kind of node that is (looks like the
integer constants are defined in generated code for each node type). If
a node represents some value, need to get it.

If I can do the above procedure, I can generate whatever I need based on
the tree.

Thanks in advance for your help.

- Leonid

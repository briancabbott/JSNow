<PRE>yes, That is of course something for ANTLR not AW. I called those error alternatives in my wish list, but then I realized that you can simply list them already without having to identify them as error alternatives. Then, in that rule, you can specify the appropriate error message.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi, In parallel with the development of ANTLR v4, superstar Colin Bean
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be building the new version of ANTLRWorks. We already have a great

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such as the automatic update facility and preferences. Because we've got
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something to play with, we have something to critique and also a basic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> target.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can imagine the basic tool being missing but it would be great to get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feedback from the antlr community.  Remember, that there are probably 2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> main communities: the people new to languages and/or ANTLR and the people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very used to working with ANTLR grammars. For example, new people tend to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like the syntax diagrams but many old-timers like myself prefer looking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at the grammar because it's more terse.  Recognizing that we must serve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> both those communities, please comment with any thoughts on the following:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * What feature seemed like a good idea, but didn't end up being that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> valuable? You can say even heretical things like: &quot; the single step
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feature in the debugger just didn't seem to be that useful beyond
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> learning about parsing&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Do you use the re-factoring? Keep in mind that v4 will automatically
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handle direct left recursion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * What features do you think are really critical to add?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * What features could be really great if we improved them?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Do we need better export facilities?   would you really use things like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;export grammar as hyperlinked HTML&quot;, for example.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * What parts of the debugger did you use? There is a lot of stuff in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there like: breakpoints on input tokens, step forward, step backward,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> jump to the end, break on specific kinds of events, break at specific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> line in the grammar, show the parse tree, show the AST constructed, list
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the incoming events, etc...  Should we rethink the entire notion of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the debugger at something that simply displays information about what it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sees during the parse?  I.e., doesn't need to be a controller in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sense that you can single step the actual running parser over the usual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> socket connection?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You might include whether you are in the newbie or experienced camp or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> somewhere in between.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Udo Borkowski has already implemented a fantastic tree layout algorithm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from an academic paper. The performance is extremely good and the results
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are tight.  Colin will probably implement his own syntax diagram viewer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so that we can make it more than just a pretty picture. We want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> highlight elements and step through etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks!

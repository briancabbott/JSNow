<PRE>Take a look at antlr.org and download antlrworks

Antlrworks can generate the the java files form the grammar files.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Background: I am not a java programmer.
</I>&gt;<i> I have read part of the antlr book by Terrence Parr.
</I>&gt;<i> I think I have gotten as far as the Chapter that use STL to build
</I>&gt;<i> programs. I can not
</I>&gt;<i> remember the exact chapter because I don't have the book
</I>&gt;<i> in front of me.
</I>&gt;<i> I did not say I understood everything in the book.
</I>&gt;<i> I think I understand a few of the examples.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An intern with more brain cells than I have left was developing
</I>&gt;<i> a program using netbeans. So I thought I would give netbeans a
</I>&gt;<i> try. That was about 5 months ago and I still have not figured
</I>&gt;<i> out how to use netbeans to build a grammar with like the examples
</I>&gt;<i> in the book. For instance, I can not figure out how to get the
</I>&gt;<i> IDE to use a separate file for a lexer-the file with the tokens instead
</I>&gt;<i> putting
</I>&gt;<i> all the tokens and the grammar in one file. As far as I can tell
</I>&gt;<i> in order to build a grammar in netbeans I need to know ant
</I>&gt;<i> and modify the build.xml to add the plug-in for antlr in netbeans.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I realize now that I would have been further along if I had
</I>&gt;<i> just used the command line instead of an IDE. But what has
</I>&gt;<i> not been done is done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Question: Are there any IDEs that make it easy or natural to
</I>&gt;<i> build programs using the code in the Antlr reference
</I>&gt;<i> book? i.e. I want to focus on the code in the book and not the IDE.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If there are not any IDEs for the IDE challenged,
</I>&gt;<i> are there any examples of building antlr programs using different IDEs?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I apologize in advance for my ignorance.
</I>&gt;<i> When I searched the list my Google-fu was weak and I could not find
</I>&gt;<i> anything relevant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you again
</I>&gt;<i> rjjr

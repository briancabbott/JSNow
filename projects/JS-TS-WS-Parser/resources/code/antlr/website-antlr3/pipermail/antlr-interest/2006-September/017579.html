</I>Hi Chris,

it isn't that bad, you only have to be aware of the fact. Also take a  
look at the mail by John yesterday.
Alternatively, I would suggest building trees and do your translation/ 
execution from that, after you fix up the tree (See [1] for a good  
abstract on
manually building trees with ANTLR).
Really take a look at the algorithm to remove non-immediate left- 
recursion [2]. It's not really intuitive at first, but
once you play around with a relatively simple example, you get the  
hang of it. Also, use ANTLRWorks to show you the tree that gets built.
And never underestimate the power of pen and paper! :)

[2] Actually, in this case the wikipedia article &lt;http:// 
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_recursion&gt; gives a pretty good picture of  
it. Who'd have thought?
     It even references a couple of papers that seems pretty good and  
also gives pictures of trees that should help. The second last  
external link
     is pretty much the stuff that's in the Dragon Book, FWIW.

Good luck!

<PRE>Yes, I should have also mentioned that one of my requirements was the ability to have private repos as well. I believe that bitbucket allows you to host unlimited repos, both public and private, for free. They do a really good job of allowing you to manage exactly what you want to make public vs private, and they make it easy to add users to a project with specific permissions.

I should also mention that I do about half of my development on Windows, and I've found that TortoiseGIT works really well on Windows.

	Question, Justin: 

	Was github not viable at the time, and if so why?  Did you need private repos?

		I've been using bitbucket with Git for a few of my projects. I spent a

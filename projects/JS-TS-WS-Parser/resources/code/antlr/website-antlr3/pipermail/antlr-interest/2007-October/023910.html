<PRE>Howdy,

I've been building up a grammar, and I don't know if I've crossed a 
magic threshold or if something else is going on. But suddenly, when I 
tell AntlrWorks to debug my grammar, it generates, compiles, and then 
goes into a &quot;Connecting...&quot; wait loop. After a bit, it times out and 
complains that it:

  Cannot launch the debugger.
  Time-out waiting to connect to the remote parser.

This is surprising because I haven't told it to do &quot;Debug Remote...&quot; or 
anything - I've got my .g file loaded, it uses Java as the underlying 
language, and I want a local debugging session.
 
If I type in a trivial grammar (target: 'a' | 'b';) then debugging works 
fine locally. For some reason my grammar is too complete, or uses some 
mysterious feature (I just added @members{...} to my parser - does that 
make a difference?) that causes it to want remote mode.
 
This would be acceptable if I had the first idea how to set up remote 
mode - I'm not a java coder by profession, so I'm figuring things out as 
I go.
 
Can anyone tell me:

1. How do I get back to local debugging for my grammar?; or

2. What features cause a java grammar to force remote debugging?; and

3. How to set up remote debugging on a Ubuntu linux system with Sun 
Java5-jdk installed?

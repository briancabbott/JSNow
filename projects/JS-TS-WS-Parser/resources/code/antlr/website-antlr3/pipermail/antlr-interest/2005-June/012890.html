<PRE>Dear ANTLR interest,

I'm going to send an e-mail that I already sent privately to Professor Parr, 
so if he gets it twice I hope he won't mind.  :-)

Thank you all for your continued support of ANTLR.  I have just started 
using this tool and I must say I am impressed with the tool's ease of use, 
power, and flexibility.

I do have a question, however, that it seems difficult to get past even 
going through the documentation for a day or two.  If this is really basic, 
please forgive my ignorance.

I am using ANTLR to generate a small language much like the Expr example 
from the article &quot;An Introduction to ANTLR.&quot;  The definition for the lexer 
and parser can be found there: 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~parrt/course/652/lectures/antlr.html">http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~parrt/course/652/lectures/antlr.html</A> .  The trouble 
is that it appears the generated ExprParser will give an incorrect parse of 
the following (that is, it seems to me that the following should fail):

3+3)

The same occurs for any combination of incorrectly matched right 
parenthesis, such as 3+3)))))) .  In addition, something such as 3+3)+2 will 
not only parse without error, it will evaluate as 3+3 - behavior that would 
be highly undesirable for my user-defined input.  However, incorrectly 
matched left parenthesis - such as (3+3 - *will* fail, which is desirable 
behavior for my app.

Therefore, what I would really like to do is check for exact matching of 
parenthesis.  Is there a simple way to do this with ANTLR grammar?

Thank you very much for your time.

Sincerely,

Jeff Steward


</PRE>

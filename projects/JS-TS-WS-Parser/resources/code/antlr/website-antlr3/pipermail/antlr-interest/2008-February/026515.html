<PRE>I am just about finished with the updates for the C runtime for the
impending ANTLR 3.1 release, but I need to verify a few things and look
for a little help.

 

Firstly, a number of you sent me bug reports, which I believe I kept
track of correctly, but I think I missed putting some of them in Jira.
Then my new mail server trashed all my archives and an eagle swooped
down from the sky and stole my homework, and&#8230; The long and short of it
is that in order that I can make sure I really have covered all the
reported bugs, if you have reported a bug or asked for a feature from me
since the last release, please send me a repeat email with the bug and I
will endeavor to ensure that the bugs are fixed. Sorry for the extra
work, but in future I will be putting things straight into Jira as I get
them rather than fooling myself that I will have the time to verify the
bugs first and so on. I am fine with getting repeat reports and won&#8217;t  b
upset or offended, so just email me anything you have in case I have
missed it. Thanks in advance for that.

 

 

Secondly, once the code is testable I would hope that some of you might
wish to try it out for m and tell me of any bugs that you find. I have
not had a lot of testing time for this release so if a few of us get
together then the testing will take no time at all. I don&#8217;t need anyone
to find the actual reason for the bugs, just give me grammar snippets or
code snippets and tell me what goes wrong. Let m know if you have time
to do that.

 

Thirdly, the other targets have unit tests that can be run for
regressions and so on. Apart from hating producing unit test, I always
think it is a good idea for someone other than the developer to write
such things. If anyone feels like they are pedantic enough to write good
unit tests for the C runtime (I don&#8217;t care how they are written etc, so
long as it does not involve installing 60 Java jars to do it ;-), then
please let me know and I will arrange some access to perforce for
writing these with Ter.

 

Finally, I intend that this release will allow the generated code to be
compiled as C++. This does not mean that the libraries will compile as
C++, they will still be an external C library, but it should mean that
you can use your own C++ classes in your grammar and they will compile
just fine. The output file will still be a .c, so it is up to you to
switch on whatever flags you need to compile it as C++. I would like to
know if anyone is willing to test this out as soon as I say go. There is
nothing special to do but try it out, but I would just like to know that
one or two people HAVE tried it out, rather than just hope they have.

 

Finally finally, this release will come with a huge improvement in API
and usage documentation, which will be placed on the web site from the
usual API documentation links on the front page.  I am hoping that a few
people might run through it looking for errors or places where my
Yorkshire/Cockney/American grammar combination doesn&#8217;t make sense.

 

Thanks for you help,

 

Jim

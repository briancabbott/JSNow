<PRE>Would this be more than some linux distro with GNOME (or some other
easy-to-use dm &amp; wm), the JDK, an ANTLR library and  ANTLRWorks on it? It
could not hurt to throw together. It would certainly increase the number of
users willing to try ANTLR. I am, however, curious as to whether or not you
wanted to add anything else to the image to ease the end-user development
experience.

&gt;<i> Since ANTLR is a starting point for a lot of people learning parsing I was
</I>&gt;<i> wondering if we should create an ANTLR virtual appliance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For those not familiar with the term virtual appliance, it is an
</I>&gt;<i> application
</I>&gt;<i> such as ANTLR that is preconfigured and installed on an OS and then
</I>&gt;<i> converted into a set of files that run on a virtual machine such as VMware,
</I>&gt;<i> Virtual Box, etc. A virtual machine that host a virtual appliance is called
</I>&gt;<i> a player. Most players are free downloads from the vendor. For free
</I>&gt;<i> software
</I>&gt;<i> such as Virtual Box no money is needed to create a virtual appliance. For
</I>&gt;<i> for profit companies such as VMware a separate purchased application is
</I>&gt;<i> needed to create the virtual appliance. So the using of the appliance is
</I>&gt;<i> free, the cost to create one is dependent on the vendor. The appliance
</I>&gt;<i> would probably be created once every several months to keep up with stable
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR releases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The  benefits to this would be that those learning ATNLR would be using a
</I>&gt;<i> known standard that anyone could access. If the person needed help, then
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> appliance with the grammar should be sufficient to reproduce the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> Another benefit is that the appliance could be setup so the user could
</I>&gt;<i> concentrate on learning ANTLR and not downloading, installing, configuring
</I>&gt;<i> and hoping.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would be willing to create  a rough cut of one if we could agree on a few
</I>&gt;<i> basics such as
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Virtual appliance player, VMware, Virtual Box or another.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. OS. It will have to be free, so some version of Linux. This means C#
</I>&gt;<i> would have to be on Mono or something.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. One back end or multiples. I opt for Java only since it is free and will
</I>&gt;<i> work on LINUX.
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Version of ANTLR. Something recent but known to be stable.
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Some way of validating that ATNLR has not been tampered with. Some form
</I>&gt;<i> of CRC or hash on the files.
</I>&gt;<i> 6. SInce this will be a several meg file, could we host it www.antlr.org,
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> park at some other repository.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts or input is welcome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks
</I>&gt;<i>

<PRE>Well, I'm not an experienced user of Antlr, but in my attempts to get it
working I have one source file (BASIC.g), which contains three
consecutive grammar definitions, namely BASICLexer, BASICParser and
BASICTreeParser.

Amongst other things, that seems to be a good way of not getting the
symbol table messed up :-) and it also makes sense to me as a simple way
to keep everything together.

So, basically :-) , I'm already using this technique, and all the stuff
about forcing the grammar file name to be an exact match to the java
class generated is likely to break my (and probably other peoples') way
of thinking.

Forcing the file name to match the root of a bunch of grammar classes,
however, is sensible and I'd go along with that no problem...

Cheers,
Wol

&gt;&gt;<i>  So &quot;grammar MyLang&quot; would generate MyLangParser.(java|tokens)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and MyLangLexer.(java|tokens).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Heh, that's pretty good!  Anybody object to this?
</I>
Well, why would you want to expose the Lexer as a top-level class if  
the user didn't even declare it explicitly? Have it be a nested class  
within the parser, that would keep the user surprise as low as possible.

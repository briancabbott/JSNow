<PRE>Problem is that I agree with all the points made ;-) Definitely with not relying on uninitialized values. 

I will look again at not initializing things that I don't know the type of as I no longer remember why that was going to be an issue. If I thought that all C users would be fine with that, then I would not do it. I know that the generated code relies on certain things being initialized - maybe that was the issue. I'll come back to the list on this one and comment the source definitively.

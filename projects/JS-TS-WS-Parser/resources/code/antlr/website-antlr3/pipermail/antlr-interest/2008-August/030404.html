<PRE>In my case (with this whole email referring to the grammar in my
application, not the sample one I sent out), unary operators are handled
in the 'prefix_operator' and 'postfix_operator' steps. One thing I
forgot to mention in my first email: 21% of the total time spent in
profiling was spent in 'primary_expression'. Since the total time spent
in 'expression' was 23%, the 6 expression levels leading to
'primary_expression' are now taking so little time that it's clearly
more beneficial for me to focus on optimizing either
'primary_expression', or better yet, the items that make up the
remaining 77% of the parse time.

As an exercise, I plan to find a way to incorporate 'ternary_expression'
into the flat parsing routine, which would lead to incorporating
'assignment_expression' as well.

What about unary operators?

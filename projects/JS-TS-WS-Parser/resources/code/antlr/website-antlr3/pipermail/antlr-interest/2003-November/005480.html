I agree with Mike. I never use ANTLR's AST features because they aren't really
for *abstract* syntax trees--they are really a kind of *concrete* syntax tree
(similarly, parse trees ala JJTree are *concrete* syntax trees). This is easy to
see because the resultant tree is built using elements of the concrete syntax
grammar. An *abstract* syntax tree is independent of the concrete syntax of the
language. In fact, usually I create a syntax-independent domain model of the
language (e.g. with classes representing all the major concepts of the
language), and then create an ANTLR grammar that can parse a syntax that allows
one to express these abstract concepts textually. If you develop a language this
way then the ANTLR &quot;AST&quot; mechanism is basically useless. But, IMO, this is the
most sensible way to develop a language tool, because once you have the domain
model built you can have one team work on the concrete syntax (text -&gt; AST) part
of the project while concurrently another team is working on the semantics (e.g.
AST evaluation, translation). 

Terence made the point that ANTLR's &quot;AST's&quot; are better than JJTree-style parse
trees because the resultant trees are less sensitive to changes in the grammar
used for parsing. But, changes in the concrete syntax of the language, and/or
changes in the grammar used to parse it, still can easily reshape the resultant
&quot;AST&quot; unless one is very careful. But, the AST-first approach completely
isolates all grammar/syntax changes from other parts of the project.

So, I guess what I would like to see is a mechanism for specifying a
syntax-independent (&quot;abstract&quot;) domain model of a language, a mechanism for
specifying how to parse concrete textual representations of the language
(grammars), and a mechanism for translating between textual representations and
the abstract domain models (either one-way text -&gt; AST, or bidirectional text
&lt;--&gt; AST).

Brian

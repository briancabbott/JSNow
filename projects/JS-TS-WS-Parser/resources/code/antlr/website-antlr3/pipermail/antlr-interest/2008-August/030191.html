&gt;<i> Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> I started out last week with ANTLR 3.1b2 to generate a parser with the C

</I>&gt;<i> it. But then I wanted to get a hold of the token offsets (start and

It depends where you are asking from. Also, if your input is really
UTF16 and not UCS2, are you using the built in conversions? The supplied
inputstreams handle latin-1 (well actually anything 8 bit) and UCS2 and
don't handle surrogates. If you want UTF32  (this is what is handled
internally) or OTF16 then you need to roll your own.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When I parse my input, the token offsets are all rubbish. 
</I>

You realize that the indexes are in characters and not bytes right? What
does your driver program look like.

&gt;<i> Although in my
</I>&gt;<i> grammar I'm using rewrite rules to generate the AST, I can reproduce it
</I>&gt;<i> with a small grammar as well. Here's what I tried:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> grammar MyGrammar;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> options {
</I>&gt;<i>   /* Generate C code */
</I>&gt;<i>   language = C ;
</I>&gt;<i>   /* Build an AST */
</I>&gt;<i>   output=AST ;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> translation_unit
</I>&gt;<i>   : NUMBER+
</I>&gt;<i>   ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> fragment
</I>&gt;<i> DIGIT_CHAR
</I>&gt;<i>   : '0'..'9'
</I>&gt;<i>   ;
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> fragment
</I>&gt;<i> DIGIT_CHAR_WITHOUT_ZERO
</I>&gt;<i>   : '1'..'9'
</I>&gt;<i>   ;
</I>&gt;<i> fragment
</I>&gt;<i> WHITESPACE_CHAR
</I>&gt;<i>   : ' ' |'\n' |'\r' | '\t'
</I>&gt;<i>   ;
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> NUMBER
</I>&gt;<i>   : ( '0' | DIGIT_CHAR_WITHOUT_ZERO ) DIGIT_CHAR*
</I>&gt;<i>   ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> WHITESPACE
</I>&gt;<i>   : WHITESPACE_CHAR {$channel = HIDDEN;} 
</I>&gt;<i>   ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For an input &quot;12376 87562356&quot; (utf-16), the parse succeeds, but the
</I>&gt;<i> start and stop index of the tokens associated with the AST nodes are way
</I>&gt;<i> off the mark. Here's what I print out for each tree node (ts is token
</I>&gt;<i> start, te is token end):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ts: 6649008 te: 6649017
</I>&gt;<i> ts: 6649020 te: 6649035
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Slightly bigger than the string I sent in. :-)
</I>

I need to see how you are asking for them. There have not been any
reports about his going wrong and I know that at least some people are
using UCS2. I intended to provide a universal input stream for 3.1 but
ran out of time. I will supply it later.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Naturally I was working with 3.1b2 and not the official release, so when
</I>&gt;<i> I saw that 3.1 was released I went ahead and tried that one. This was
</I>&gt;<i> even worse! 
</I>

Are you sure you don't need a few more exclamation marks to get across
your disdain with more emphasis?


&gt;<i> 3.1 with the C target does not even generate the type of the
</I>&gt;<i> AST in the return structs of the rules. 
</I>

I think that you meant to say: &quot;I looked in the past posts of the last
two weeks and saw that this question was answered 6 times already and
that when producing trees you need:

options
{
   ASTLabelType=pANTLR3_BASE_TREE;
}

&gt;<i> Clearly we are missing something important here. Or maybe I am missing
</I>&gt;<i> something obvious. I used the C-runtime from the ANTLR source
</I>&gt;<i> distribution and tried it also with the stand-alone C lib distro. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> building an Ubuntu 7.1 with gcc 3.4 (64-bit).
</I>

Try the released runtime, correcting your grammar and make sure that you
are using the UCS2 input stream. Use the built in references for $pos
and so on in the lexer and see what you get.

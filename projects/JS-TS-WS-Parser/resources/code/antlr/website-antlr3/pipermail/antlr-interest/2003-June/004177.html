Okay this all sounds like 'The Right Way'(tm). These template directives
are then MSVC7 centric. I already thought they was a bit funny as I got the
patch for them, since I tried those standard compliant template
instantiations in the time I still had easy access to MSVC6. So they
probably need to be out #ifdef'ed for MSVC6. I have no idea what arcane
dealings are needed to do that. Probably your MSVC manual can help you
there. Let me know what it is and I add #ifdefs for the next snapshot. In
the past MSVC6 worked for the static build so I at least want to get that
back to work.

Thanks for the feedback!

Ric

PS I have no easy access to MSVC6 so I cannot help/test very much

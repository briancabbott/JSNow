&gt;<i> Hi there,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You brought up a really good idea -- a &quot;what can you use this for&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> document that shows a handful of common uses. I also want to think 
</I>&gt;<i> about how to improve the initial learning pieces on the Wiki.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A handful of thoughts from an old hand (who wrote or edited a bunch of 
</I>&gt;<i> intro material on the Wiki): 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. We could probably get enough up on the Wiki to help someone make an 
</I>&gt;<i> initial evaluation of ANTLR, but developing with it pretty much 
</I>&gt;<i> requires buying the book from the Pragmatic Programmers. (Which it 
</I>&gt;<i> sounds like you've done, thank you. I could make that requirement 
</I>&gt;<i> clearer on the Wiki.)
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Really understanding what's going on sometimes requires a look at 
</I>&gt;<i> the generated code and/or the runtime support classes. I understand 
</I>&gt;<i> you .Net folks are dealing with a bit of a black box there.
</I>If I had to do more, I'd look more into getting the debugger to walk 
into the runtime (I'd rebuild it if I have to) A VS.Net project we can 
drop in would be killer.

&gt;<i> 3. Compiler construction and its cousins Lexing and Parsing are 
</I>&gt;<i> *hard*. If you think the ANTLR documentation is challenging, try 
</I>&gt;<i> reading Aho, Sethi, and Ullman.
</I>
Some day I will. I'm one of the few people I know of who look forwards 
to the compilers class?

&gt;<i> There's a balance between setting people's expectations and scaring 
</I>&gt;<i> them away. On the other hand, I appreciate constructive conversations 
</I>&gt;<i> about helping people get started. (I got my start teaching software 
</I>&gt;<i> development courses and I'm still partial to the newcomers. :) )
</I>
thanks for putting up with us.

&gt;<i> We could probably use some examples in C# and other languages. (The 
</I>&gt;<i> bulk of the Wiki examples, including some very detailed tutorials, is 
</I>&gt;<i> in Java.) 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>that would help. Being able to run stuff is nice. But to a great extent 
my problem wasn't language specific.

&gt;<i> Thanks for the feedback,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
your welcome.

&gt;<i> ...Richard

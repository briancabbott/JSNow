I think I've finally figured out what's been bothering me. Here's some
valid Progress code:

&amp;GLOBAL-DEFINE XX &amp;GLOBAL-DEFINE HI &quot;Hello world!&quot;
{&amp;XX}
DISPLAY {&amp;HI}.

Of course, C doesn't let you get away with the above nonsense. What I think
the above shows is that we can't build a complete graph of the
preprocessing without actually evaluating the preprocessing expressions and
expansions.

Here's an expression that would have to be evaluated:

&amp;IF OPSYS = &quot;VMS&quot; &amp;THEN
  &amp;GLOBAL-DEFINE OSINCLUDE include/vms.i
&amp;ENDIF
{{&amp;OSINCLUDE}}

We'd have to evaluate for both true and false on OPSYS = &quot;VMS&quot;. If we never
evaluated for true, we'd never evaluate the text in the include file, and
our graph would be incomplete.

If we have to evaluate for every possible combination of conditions, then
for some compile units we might be talking about an astronomical number of
possible states, and graphing becomes impractical.

A friend suggested that this sort of graphing problem is similar to other
problems as well, and mentioned NP Complete. I've no education for this
stuff, so I'll have to hit the books for this one.

Cheers,
John

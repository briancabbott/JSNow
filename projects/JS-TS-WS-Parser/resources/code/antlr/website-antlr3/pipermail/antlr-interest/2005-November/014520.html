<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; In any case you've omitted the per-character call for col/offset 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tracking. We were discussing line/col/offset counting not just 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; newlines.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, the offset gets tracked anyway, as ANTLR is going 
</I>&gt;<i> through a String where it has to track the input position 
</I>&gt;<i> anyways. That value is IIRC also accessible (or could be made 
</I>&gt;<i> accessible very easily).
</I>
Assuming the implementation buffers the whole input in a string/char[]. Not
optimal for larger files (especially if parser is building ASTs and
&quot;project&quot; contains multiple files).

&gt;<i> What is left is line breaks. How would you imagine ANTLR 
</I>&gt;<i> Lexers do that more efficiently? E.g. always checking if the 
</I>&gt;<i> next character(s) is a \r \n, \n or \r? What about users that 
</I>&gt;<i> want \0 to be their line separator? Or users that don't want 
</I>&gt;<i> that at all?
</I>
Special syntax to inform ANTLR of what constitues a &quot;newline&quot;?

&gt;<i> &gt; If the lexer was built to do it properly, there would be no 
</I>&gt;<i> function 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; calls at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The overhead of a function call on x86 is very low. Plus, 
</I>&gt;<i> your compiler might decide to inline, at least in managed 
</I>&gt;<i> languages, as said. For C++ a no-virtual-method-needed way 
</I>&gt;<i> via templates has been discussed.
</I>
Either way, the lexer core either supports it or performance degrades
(probably not as much for C/C++).

&gt;<i> The only thing that is (currently) done using an overridden 
</I>&gt;<i> method is the newline thing, isn't it? A per character 
</I>&gt;<i> virtual method call would be ugly, that's true.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are you using the Lexer standalone? Even in that case I'd 
</I>&gt;<i> wonder if it really makes a difference. For each character 
</I>&gt;<i> you have at least one switch, you have the testing of 
</I>&gt;<i> alternatives etc. Will a virtual method call for every ~20 
</I>&gt;<i> characters make a difference bigger than maybe 1%?
</I>
For tracking newlines only, it will be on par with ANTLR v2 lexers I guess.

&gt;<i> I'm not generally arguing against including something like 
</I>&gt;<i> that, but you'd have to find a very flexible way to do so. 
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise users will be unhappy because it doesn't match what 
</I>&gt;<i> they want to have, and their solution might get more complex.
</I>
Would some syntax that instructs ANTLR on what constitutes a newline do?

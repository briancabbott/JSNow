Well, I've checked again, for the 17th time, and there is no such 
conflict.

There is a lexer rule called Period whose right hand side is simply '.'. 
I put a backslash in (though my understanding is that a dot is only a 
single-character wild-card outside of a quoted string) but it had no 
effect. There was an (unused) lexer rule fragment called PrintableChar 
which was indeed simply a wild-card dot (no quote marks of any sort). 
Removing this rule did not change the diagnostic.

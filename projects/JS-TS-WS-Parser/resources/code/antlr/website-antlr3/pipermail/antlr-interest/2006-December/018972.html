</I>&gt;<i> I'm working on a project that requires me to translate a domain

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example:  (each employee is member of a department)

</I>&gt;<i> SELECT firstname + ' ' + lastname, department.name FROM employees
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be translated into something like:

</I>&gt;<i> SELECT e.firstname + ' ' + e.lastname, d.name from employees e LEFT

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have the grammer for my parser figured out and I can build an AST

</I>Actually, an AST just represents a particular input in thelanguage. 
You're building a grammar that will tell ANTLR how to generate
code that generates such ASTs.

&gt;<i> but I'm kind of STUCK on what to do next. I need to semantically 
</I>&gt;<i> validate the query; but how?
</I>I assume you mean here that you need to semantically *understand* the 
query, not validate it.
You need to know things like &quot;does this SELECT statement in my input 
language require me to generate an SQL JOIN?&quot;,
not &quot;Is this input actually reasonable?&quot;


&gt;<i> Do I do this in a treewalker? Do I need a symbol table? And how can I 
</I>&gt;<i> translate the query into SQL statements? Do I use templates? 
</I>&gt;<i> TemplateString?
</I>I would start by writing down, say, 10 example translations for 
SELECT...so you really get a field for what you'll need
to do to map your DSL to SQL. Then figure out what your logic needs to 
be (e.g. &quot;SELECT in my DSL always maps
to SQL SELECT&quot;, &quot;any time I see &lt;otherTableName&gt;.&lt;fieldName&gt; in my DSL, 
I'll need to generate a JOIN&quot;, etc).
Then plug your examples into ANTLR and make sure you're generating 
reasonable ASTs and make sure you understand
the structure of the ASTs (&quot;e.g. a SELECT node's first child is a 
FIELDS_TO_SELECT NODE and its second child
is a FROM node&quot;, and the optional third child is a WHERE node&quot;).

I then would start writing a little vanilla Java code that walks the 
AST, doing things in whatever way seems right to you.
After a day or two of that, step back and say, &quot;Am I really just doing 
some simple action at each particular place in the AST?&quot;
If so, then a treewalker might be simpler and easier. If not, just keep 
going.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not so much interested in any 'specific' help (altough that would 
</I>&gt;<i> be appreciated). I'm interested in the steps that are needed to get to 
</I>&gt;<i> the solution. How many treewalkers? What does each do etc...
</I>I don't see the need for a &quot;validating treewalk&quot; unless you really 
aren't sure that the input is valid, which seems
weird to me. Obviously, there are always cases where you might get 
invalid input, but presumably your one-and-only
treewalker will give an error in that case.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have any idea, it would be greatly appreciated!
</I>&gt;<i>

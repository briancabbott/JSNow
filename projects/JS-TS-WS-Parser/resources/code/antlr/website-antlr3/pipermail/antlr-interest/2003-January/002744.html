<PRE>Hello :-

I am not sure that this reply to your lexical non-determinism question will
be of any help to you...

I strictly focused on the lexer, I think your parser has alot of problems but
I suspect that you are still working on the parser so I did not worry too
much about its problems.

I was able to remove some of the lexical non-determinism in your lexer (an
updated CSVLexer is attached). But I could not completely remove all of the
non-determinism.

The non-determinism in your lexer seems to be centered on your RECORD token.

The first problem I see is between RECORD and NUMERIC. Your rules are:

RECORD  : ('a'..'z' | 'A'..'Z'| NUMERIC)(!~('\r'|'\n'|':'))+ ;

NUMERIC : ('0'..'9'|','|'.'|'-')+;

the problem I see here is that when trying to recognize RECORD, and if the
lexer is given the sequence of characters 000000, the lexer is unable to
determine whether the second and subsequen 0's belong to the leading NUMERIC
sub-component of the RECORD token or belong to the trailing
(!~('\r'|'\n'|':'))+ sub-component of the RECORD token. So I would change
these token rule to be:

protected DIGIT : '0'..'9'|','|'.'|'-';

NUMERIC : ( DIGIT )+;

RECORD : ('a'..'z' | 'A'..'Z' | DIGIT) (!~('\r'|'\n'|':'))+;

and we now have just a single leading character for RECORD followed by any
number of non-(newline or colon) characters. But we still have some
non-determinism here. We have specified that the sequence of characters
000000 is to be recognized as either a NUMERIC token or a RECORD token and
the lexer has no way of knowing which token we really want.

The next problem I see is with the KEYWORD token. There is internal
non-determinism in this token's definition because your k=4 character look
ahead is not enough to uniquely identify all of the keywords. For example
&quot;initial color&quot; and &quot;initial line width&quot; are identical in the first 4
characters, these two keyword strings would need k=9 look ahead I think.

But I really hate look ahead and so I would replace your KEYWORD rule with:

KEYWORD
    : &quot;angle factor&quot;
    | &quot;back distance&quot;
    | &quot;c&quot; ( &quot;olor increment&quot; | &quot;ue range&quot; )
    | &quot;diffuse reflection&quot;
    | &quot;elasticity increment&quot;
    | &quot;front distance&quot;
    | &quot;initial &quot; ( &quot;color&quot; | &quot;elasticity&quot; | &quot;line width&quot; )
    | &quot;li&quot; ( &quot;ght direction&quot; | &quot;ne &quot; ( &quot;style&quot; | &quot;width increment&quot; ) )
    | &quot;projection&quot;
    | &quot;render mode&quot;
    | &quot;s&quot; ( &quot;cale factor&quot; | &quot;hade mode&quot; )
    | &quot;t&quot; ( &quot;ropism direction&quot; | &quot;wist&quot; )
    | &quot;view&quot; ( &quot; reference point&quot; | &quot;point&quot; )
    | &quot;z buffer&quot;
    ;

Unfortunately this still leaves us with lexical non-determinism between
KEYWORD and RECORD because we have specified that the character sequence (for
example):

				angle factor

is both a KEYWORD token and a RECORD token. The lexer has no way of knowing
which token we really want.

This is the complete modified lexer I tried:
//------------------
class CSVLexer extends Lexer;
options {
    charVocabulary='\3'..'\377';
    /*k = 4;*/
}

protected DIGIT : '0'..'9'|','|'.'|'-';

NUMERIC : ( DIGIT )+;

RECORD : ('a'..'z' | 'A'..'Z' | DIGIT) (!~('\r'|'\n'|':'))+;

KEYWORD
    : &quot;angle factor&quot;
    | &quot;back distance&quot;
    | &quot;c&quot; ( &quot;olor increment&quot; | &quot;ue range&quot; )
    | &quot;diffuse reflection&quot;
    | &quot;elasticity increment&quot;
    | &quot;front distance&quot;
    | &quot;initial &quot; ( &quot;color&quot; | &quot;elasticity&quot; | &quot;line width&quot; )
    | &quot;li&quot; ( &quot;ght direction&quot; | &quot;ne &quot; ( &quot;style&quot; | &quot;width increment&quot; ) )
    | &quot;projection&quot;
    | &quot;render mode&quot;
    | &quot;s&quot; ( &quot;cale factor&quot; | &quot;hade mode&quot; )
    | &quot;t&quot; ( &quot;ropism direction&quot; | &quot;wist&quot; )
    | &quot;view&quot; ( &quot; reference point&quot; | &quot;point&quot; )
    | &quot;z buffer&quot;
    ;

SEMICOLON : ':'; // ??? maybe should be ';', ':' is a COLON

BRACKET : ('(' | ')');

COMMENT : &quot;/*&quot; (options {greedy=false;} :.)* &quot;*/&quot; ;

NEWLINE : ('\r''\n')=&gt; '\r''\n' //DOS
        | '\r'                  //MAC
        | '\n'                  //UNIX
        { newline(); }
        ;
   
WS      : (' '|'\t') { $setType(Token.SKIP); } ;
//--------------------

and these are the errors Antlr finds when processing the modified lexer:
//--------------------
java antlr.Tool CSVLexer.g
ANTLR Parser Generator   Version 2.7.2a4 (20021027-1)   1989-2002 jGuru.com
warning: lexical nondeterminism between rules NUMERIC and RECORD upon
CSVLexer.g: 	k==1:','..'.','0'..'9'
warning: lexical nondeterminism between rules RECORD and KEYWORD upon
CSVLexer.g: 	k==1:'a'..'f','i','l','p','r'..'t','v','z'
//--------------------

I suspect you could probably use lexical states to distinguish when NUMERIC,
KEYWORD, and RECORD are expected to be uniquely valid in the input stream of
characters from the file. But lexical states can get really nasty. I hope
that perhaps you are able to refine your parsing rules so that these three
ambiguous tokens can be re-defined to be unambigous.

Hope this helps...

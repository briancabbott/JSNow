<PRE>hi all,
  i apologize i was not careful and sent a couple of replies
  to individuals when in fact i meant to send them back on
  this thread on the mailing list..

  below are my followup thoughts on this subject..

  you're correct.
here is an illustration of my problem and why i think
whitespace significance plays a role:

length returns [Length value]
 : INT Unit
 {
   $value = new Length(Integer.parseInt($INT.text), $Unit.text);
 }
 ;

the rule matches &quot;4 px&quot; and not &quot;4px&quot; (what i want).
i believe that if whitespace was significant (not skipped
or hidden) then the rule would work/match.

-----
i've been thinking about this and there's something fundamental
that i don't understand.

changing the rule to a Lexer rule:  &quot;Length&quot;, which must return
a single token, resolves the problem.  but lexer rules cannot
return custom objects.  i'm at a point in this rule where i've
parsed, say, that '4px' value and i have the parts, and i want
to now construct a corresponding object from the parts, not
just match the result.  if i just match the result, i end up with
'4px' as the value of my Token.text and then i have to parse
it again later to extract the parts (say in java using regex),
which seems to defeat the purpose of writing a parser.

anyone want to clue me in on what's wrong with my above
line of thinking?

i suppose that brings up this next question:  how to define a global in
antlrv3.
i can define the boolean in @member but then it's not visible in the lexer
(and vice versa).  i tried using a global scope but ran into the same
problem:  the scope's stack is visible only in the parser and not the lexer.



thanks, / eitan

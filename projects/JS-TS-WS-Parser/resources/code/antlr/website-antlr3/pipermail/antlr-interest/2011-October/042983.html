<PRE>Hi,
I got over a first round of problems and got a few trivial example working. I then moved on to trying to convert on of the examples from &quot;The Definitive Guide to ANTLR&quot; from Java-compatible to C# compatible:
<A HREF="http://media.pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr/code/tour/eval/Expr.g">http://media.pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr/code/tour/eval/Expr.g</A>
It is a simple calculator example, before he introduces ASTs.
I have run into two problems. The first seems to be related to Sam's visual studio integration tools, and particularly to the use of partial classes. This seems in some cases to cause this error:
K:\Plantronics\Development Sandbox\ANTLR\AntlrTest\AntlrTest3\Program.cs(13,30): error CS1729: 'AntlrTest3.Combined1Lexer' does not contain a constructor that takes 1 arguments
One of the partial class definitions for Combined1Lexer does not indicate that Combined1Lexer inherits from Lexer and that presumably causes the constructor not to be found. If I remove the file containing the partial class definition from the project, that problem goes away. The funny thing is that this problem seems to happen on some projects and not others, which is weird. Another weird thing is that explicitly changing the partial class definition to inherit from Lexer causes a different problem:
K:\Plantronics\Development Sandbox\ANTLR\AntlrTest\AntlrTest3\Combined1.g3.lexer.cs(5,17): error CS0534: 'AntlrTest3.Combined1Lexer' does not implement inherited abstract member 'Antlr.Runtime.Lexer.mTokens()'

The second problem is that the example code in the book contains a call to one of the rules, in my code this looks like this:
Combined1Parser parser = new Combined1Parser(tokens);
// Begin parsing at rule prog
parser.prog();

But the generated code for CombinedParser defines prog() as being a private method, meaning that I can't call it. Can someone explain this?

Just when it looks like I'm gaining traction, I run into more weird stuff.


-    Andy

P.S. I've run this example in Antlrworks with the Java-compatible version, and everything works fine, so these problems all seem to be related to the C# target.

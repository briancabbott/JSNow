<PRE>&gt;<i> You are getting this because you are using the ! operator and the -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> rewrites at the same time, and you must chose one or the other.
</I>
That's what I was afraid of. Apparently v3 does not build the default tree if there is a rewrite rule present, and given the power and possibibilities with the rewrite rules I can see that the behaviour would not necessarily be predictable otherwise.

&gt;<i> You probably want a rewrite like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  	optionCmd: p=OptionKeyword (Dot!)? 
</I>&gt;<i>                  (
</I>&gt;<i>  			  t=StrictKeyword                    -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> ^(GenericStatement $t)
</I>&gt;<i>  			| a=MaxDurationKeyword b=intData     -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> ^(GenericStatement $a $b)
</I>&gt;<i>  		     )
</I>
Your suggestion is actually a good example of why I don't like doing this; Apart from cluttering the grammar with rewrite rules (all more or less alike), and thus decrease the readability, it is also bug prone - in this case the $p keyword was omitted. As always, tradeoffs may of course be necessary.
However, I guess that it is possible to do what I wanted (add a root node to the default tree with some items omitted) with Java code in the @after section. The good news is that now that I look at the problem again even that may not be necessary - as I put the produced tree into a Java list anyway I can probably just make sure the tree isn't used in higher level rules.

&gt;<i> Though perhaps you would want a different Node type for the two alts?
</I>
Not at this stage, the keywords are kept mostly for debugging. The trees are used to check for the availability and correctness of variables and other references.

Thanks anyway,
Mats

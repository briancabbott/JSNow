<PRE>I'm trying to convert some bison grammar to work with Antlr and could do with 
some pointers on what needs to be done next...


I'm getting lots of output like : 

        fgl_v3.g:164:12: Decision can match input such as &quot;NAMED OPEN_BRACKET&quot; 
using    
        multiple alternatives: 4, 5
        As a result, alternative(s) 5 were disabled for that input

        fgl_v3.g:285:2: Decision can match input such as &quot;AFTCONSTRUCT&quot; using   
        multiple alternatives: 1, 2
        As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input

        fgl_v3.g:285:2: Decision can match input such as &quot;KW_ON&quot; using 
multiple 
        alternatives: 1, 2
        As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input

        fgl_v3.g:285:2: Decision can match input such as &quot;BEFCONSTRUCT&quot; using           
        multiple alternatives: 1, 2
        As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input

        fgl_v3.g:285:2: Decision can match input such as &quot;ON_ANY_KEY&quot; using 
multiple    
        alternatives: 1, 2
        As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input

.
.
.
        fgl_v3.g:1959:31: ANTLR could not analyze this decision in rule 
message_cmd;    
        often this is because of recursive rule references visible from the 
left edge   
        of alternatives.  ANTLR will re-analyze the decision with a fixed 
lookahead 
        of k=1.  Consider using &quot;options {k=1;}&quot; for that decision and 
possibly 
        adding a syntactic predicate.




Any help gratefully received!

Grammar is here : http:/www.aubit.com/fgl_v3.g 

FWIW - The 'end game' is to end up with some some of tree I can walk down to 
generate 
my code rather than the current &quot;generate as I parse&quot; bison stuff...

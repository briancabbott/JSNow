<PRE>Randall--

Interaction between parser and lexer would only be feasible at LL(1) decision points in the parser, and that would make the resulting grammars very fragile--tweak the grammar to add an alternative (perhaps elsewhere), and that decision goes from LL(1) to LL(2).  The problem with ANTLR 3 is that Ter deliberately introduced combined grammars to mimic the appearance of scannerless parsers; I thought that that was a mistake at the time and still do.  I also find it annoying that separation of parser and lexer into different grammars is inconvenient, to say the least, and the scannerless appearance of combined grammars catches a very high percentage of newbies.

I think that what is really needed instead of parser/lexer communication is a solution to the lexer FOLLOW set problem, possibly coupled with lexer states; that would bring back the ANTLR 2 lexing capabilities which were pretty amazing.

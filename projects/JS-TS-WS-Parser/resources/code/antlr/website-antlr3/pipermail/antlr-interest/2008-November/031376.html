I'd like to have a simple grammar that recognizes assignments. An assignment has an ID on the left side, and either an ID or a non-empty sequence(list) on the right side. Sequences can be embedded. The string 'SEQUENCE' should be allowed in a sequence, being an ID there.

I came across two mutually exclusive problems:

First, if I allow 'SEQUENCE' to be an ID, I have ambiguity errors in the grammar. Tried to get rid of it using fragments but not succeeded yet. I assume there should be no ambuiguity looking forward one token. If the next token is '{', it should denote a sequence def, otherwise it should be an ID.

Second, if I want 'SEQUENCE'  to be a reserved keyword, I don't know how to specify that this string should not be recognized as an ID. I assume I have to do something with the ID rule, but currently have no clue how to do that. I examined the v1.5 Java Grammar available on the antlr site, looking for keyword and identifier relation inside, but found nothing. I even tried to start with rule Identifier (for this I had to bring it forward as the first rule) to see what happens when I specify keywords, but the grammar had errors (The following token definitions can never be matched because prior tokens match the same input: ENUM,ASSERT).

Unfortunately my grammar got a bit large, and still not working yet :( I think I have to invest a couple of hours more to do it right :)

However, if you could help to flatten the learning curve, please do not hesitate. Thanks for the answers so far.

  Andr&#225;s

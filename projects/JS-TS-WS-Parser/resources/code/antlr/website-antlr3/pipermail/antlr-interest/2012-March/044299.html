<PRE>Hi,

I took a look a more detailed look at that and lzz. I prefer the approach of makeheaders - unfortunately it is old enough that it does not understand namespaces. Still, for a project that does not need namespaces, it might just work.

I find it AMAZING that C/C++ programmers put up with the hassle of manual header file maintenance, and that no other tool seems to be in widespread use.  Last time I checked it was 2012, not 1985.

Hi Andy,

FWIW I did a quick search and found makeheaders.

Hi,

Does anyone know of any tools for generating C/C++ header files automatically from an annotated version of the C/C++ source files? I really hate writing and maintaining header files in C/C++.

This isn't strictly related to Antlr, other than the fact that Antlr would be a logical front end for such a tool. But I thought that the same types that hang out in Antlr-land might know about such things.

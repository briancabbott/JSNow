<PRE>Hi,

Indeed doesn't work tested it just now.

</I>
Just finished figuring out how to do this and doing some tweaking. Unless
the general opinion goes another direction than 3.

&gt;<i> And if this is not huge amount of work, why not to make it configurable and

</I>
See my opinion on making it configurable I'm not doing it (nor accepting
patches for it).

&gt;<i> BTW, I still wonder on internal generation code algorithm.

</I>
It's indeed an one-pass-ish implementation and yes it's unpractical. After
2.7.2 I'll start restructuring things for 3.0, after hacking around this
latest optimization I must say I'm sick and tired of it. Multipass parsing
will certainly be a feature in 3.0.

&gt;<i> Why ???
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why the GREAT tool that we all use to make compilers,
</I>&gt;<i> in most cases the multi-pass compilers:
</I>&gt;<i> -- parse and build AST for the whole file
</I>&gt;<i> -- optimize tree
</I>&gt;<i> -- generate code
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> can not self do this in several passes ???
</I>
Because we have to rewrite it (at least partly) to do this. And there's no
one paid to do this, so I guess no one get's annoyed enough with the
current implementation to do some rewriting, since we're all very busy ppl,
so we keep having a one pass thing. After the 2.7.2 release I for one am
going to do some restructuring, I don't want to kludge around these
limitations anymore.

&gt;<i> Why ANTLR can not parse the whole grammar and build in RAM AST tree,
</I>&gt;<i> later analyze and optimize tree, and only after this generate PERFECT code.
</I>
Of course this is possible it only needs to be done see time remarks above.

&gt;<i> I do not think that looking into semantic action to see WHAT tokens are used
</I>&gt;<i> in it is bad idea.
</I>
It isn't only in the current implementation it's a d*mn PITA. And basically
not worth doing, because around every corner you'll run into another
problem.

&gt;<i> I WANT THIS TO SEE IN NEAREST ANTLR versions !!!  :-)
</I>
Somewhere in 5 years a 2.7.2 release, seems like a nice schedule for a
perfect version ? &gt;:-(

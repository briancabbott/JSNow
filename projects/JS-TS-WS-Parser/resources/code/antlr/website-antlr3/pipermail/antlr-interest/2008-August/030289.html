</I>&gt;&gt;<i>(albeit awkwardly) by specifying all the intermediate prefixes as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>other tokens, using this grammar:
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Comment :    '[!--'  (options {greedy=false;} : . )* '--]' ;

</I>&gt;<i> This is my pet peeve with the way that the v3 lexer

</I>&gt;<i> it's an unhelpful design.  Ter has agreed to look into it at some
</I>&gt;<i> point.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I'm not really an expert in the internal workings of parsers,
</I>&gt;<i> but as I understand it what's going on internally is that ANTLR
</I>&gt;<i> builds a set of minimal lookahead to disambiguate between multiple
</I>&gt;<i> tokens, *and* (and this is the bit that causes the odd behaviour)
</I>&gt;<i> assumes that the tokens need not be contiguous -- it's allowed to
</I>&gt;<i> have stray characters outside of any formal token, which it simply
</I>&gt;<i> ignores.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So when you've only got your original rules, ANTLR builds up an
</I>&gt;<i> internal model that says something like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Ok, so the next character is a '['.
</I>&gt;<i>   That means it can either be a Comment, a Lsqb, or a Text.
</I>&gt;<i>   For it to be a Comment, the one after that would be a '!'.
</I>&gt;<i>   For it to be a Lsqb, the one after that could be anything.
</I>&gt;<i>   For it to be a Text, the one after that could be anything but a
</I>&gt;<i> '['.
</I>&gt;<i>   The following character is a '!'.
</I>&gt;<i>   Score!  That looks like a Comment, I'll go with that.
</I>&gt;<i>     (Comment wins both because it's more specific and because
</I>&gt;<i> it's listed first, I think.)
</I>&gt;<i>   Sweet, now we're certain it's a Comment, so the next character
</I>&gt;<i> must be a '-'.
</I>&gt;<i>   Wait, it's not.  Ok, so that's invalid input, ignore that and
</I>&gt;<i> let's move on to something I can figure out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [This all might be completely wrong, of course, but it fits with
</I>&gt;<i> what I've observed thus far.]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the rules you posted above, ANTLR has more tokens to choose
</I>&gt;<i> between and this forces it to look ahead further before
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;committing&quot; itself to a particular token.
</I>That looks right. Examining the tokens DFA either through the function
for that in ANTLRWorks or by looking at the generated nextTokens rule
can be illuminating here.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The general rule of thumb I tend to use is that most of the time
</I>&gt;<i> the lexer seems to behave like it's just LL(1), so any tokens that
</I>&gt;<i> have the same left edge need to be merged and given explicit
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;escape clauses&quot; so they can do the right thing when they
</I>&gt;<i> encounter something unexpected.
</I>Not quite. ANTLR is LL(*), it looks ahead as many *characters* as are
needed not just 1, but not across token boundaries. So as long as the
alternates are all a single token there is no need to merge rules. But
if a sequence can be matched as either a single token or a sequence of
multiple tokens you must merge them as ANTLR will not consider the
possibility of multiple tokens matching the input. Apart from this I
don't think there is any advantage to merging except for particularly
nasty infinite sequences where you may end up with hideously
complicated predictors. Otherwise in the case of single tokens I think
merging will only hurt performance as the prediction must be
duplicated in nextToken and the actual token method.

</I>&gt;<i> Essentially the same as what Jim posted earlier, except that I
</I>&gt;<i> think he forgot some of the punctuation; also, I prefer to
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly write the content possibilities instead of using the
</I>&gt;<i> '.':
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> fragment Lsqb: '[';
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Comment
</I>&gt;<i>   : '['
</I>&gt;<i>     ( ('!--') =&gt; '!--' (~'-' | '-' (~'-' | '-' ~']'))* '--]'
</I>&gt;<i>     | { $type = Lsqb; }
</I>&gt;<i>     )
</I>&gt;<i>   ;

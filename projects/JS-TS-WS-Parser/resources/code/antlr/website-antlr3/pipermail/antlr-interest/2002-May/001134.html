</I>
Who me? ;)  I've been waiting to see what direction people would point 
me. ;)  I've just looked at the source for Character.getType() and all 
those wacky mysterious tables at the bottom of the Character.java source.

Recall that ANTLR generates bitsets on its own.  If you say (' '|'\t') 
or 'a'..'z' you'll see that antlr tests LA(1) is member &quot;some bitset 
defined in bottom of lexer file&quot;.  What we need is for ANTLR to be aware 
of the standard categories (UnicodeBlocks) like LOWERCASE_LETTER.  The 
only problem is that we'll have to convert LOWERCASE_LETTER to a 
straight bitset that maps char -&gt; yes/no if it's in that set.  So we 
could do test LA(1), the next char of lookahead, against it.  Also, 
don't forget that ANTLR needs to do the grammar analysis so that it can 
determine if you have a nondetermism.  For example, I presume the 
following would be ambiguous/nondeterministic:

DUH : LOWERCASE_LETTER | BASIC_LATIN | BENGALI ;

I believe I could predefine all these character categories and then 
simply let you refer to them.  Note that for every set you reference 
though would be a potentially very big uncompressed bitset.  Worst case, 
if you have digit \uFFFE defined, you'd have about 65 kilobits in the 
set or about 8k per bitset.  Every time I have to combine this set with 
a character or another set, that's another 8k worst case.  I could 
probably make a simple compression that ignored long runs of zeros on 
the front of the bit set.

Is this the kind of thing you would need?  I.e., to be able to 
specifically refer to predefined Java character blocks as predefined 
ANTLR &quot;characters&quot;?

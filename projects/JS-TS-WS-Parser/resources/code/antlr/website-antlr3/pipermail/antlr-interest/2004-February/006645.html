<PRE>The reason i want it as a single piece is because there are so many
different forms of data that can come in that field

They run the gamut from semi-colon-separated lists of (~';')* to
base-64 or quoted-printable encoded text.  The latter are the ones
that give me serious fits, since i really don't know how to parse
those.  But i figure worst case, i get the whole thing in as one
element and use other parsing methods on it as needed.

The other kicker is, the type of encoding is specified by a token that
precedes that value, by some arbitrary (albeit bounded by the start of
the line) number of tokens.

Can you suggest the syntactic predicate and (i assume) text rewriting
that i would need to do this?  I'm at a bit of a dead end here.

Thanks for the help, and if someone *does* see a better solution than
the one i've got, please feel free to tell me!

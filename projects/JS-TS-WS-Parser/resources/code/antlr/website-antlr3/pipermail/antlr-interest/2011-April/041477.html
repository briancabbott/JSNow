<PRE>Hi YY,

to respond to your wondering: there is no primary task requiring an XML 
representation of grammars. It occurred to me when noticing that the official 
JPQL grammar references rules that do not exist, and that an XML representation 
would allow to detect such things with a simple XQuery expression, a one-liner, 
with mathematical precision.

It seems to me there is an irony in the fact that a grammar - artefact&#160;meant to 
map syntax to logical structure - is so deeply steeped in syntax itself. This is 
no criticsm, just stirring my curiosity. The terseness and expressiveness of 
EBNF is indispensible, but perhaps we should have the possibility to switch back 
and forth between the terse and an XML representation? XML is a way to present 
logical structure in pure form (I am sure you agree - the angle brackets etc. 
are only the serialization format, not the thing &quot;itself&quot;, which is a tree of 
information items), which enables operations on the information, operations 
whose precision, aggregative nature and conciseness are difficult to attain in 
any other way. I consider this example: let there be two grammars, which differ 
in respect to embedded actions, but not in respect to rule references. If we 
have&#160;an XML representation of the grammar available, this relationship can be 
revealed with few lines of XSLT or XQuery code, but how else? I am really 
curious. An attempt to to it with a filtering parser which filters out actions 
is, in comparison, much more work to achieve and also less clear in its results, 
more in need of an interpretation (&quot;yes, the equality of the two token streams 
(resulting from the filtering) implies that the two grammars are equal in 
respect to the rule - token reference - structure&quot;). XML allows&#160;to express such 
relationships rather explicitly and very&#160;tersely. Another example would be the 
possibility to detect equivalence of rules in spite of different choices of rule 
names. I imagine that such relationships may be&#160;important when trying to 
integrate work from different sources, or relating&#160;own work to existing work. &#160;

Cheers,

Hi,

I had a similar thought myself that this could be very handy while
jumping into the markup realm.

XML itself is described using an adaptation of EBNF. There is also a
respective ISO standard for EBNF.
But I am unaware of any XML (markup) representation of ENBF syntax. I
believe it is not so complicated to produce a XSD for this and s.o.

I wonder if there is any primary task you are urgent to solve with
this besides satisfying own transformation joy?

If you mean, can you have a result 'tree' without a root, then yes
(NB lower-case letters for parser rule names):

  ruleA: B C D E;
  rule1: ruleA F -&gt; ^(DEF ruleA F)
         ;

will result in a result tree being produced from rule1 which has DEF as
its root, and B C D E F as its children.

Actually, ANTLR does this by producing a special ('null') tree node as
the result of ruleA which will be recognised and discarded when added to
the result tree of rule1, if that makes any sense..?

<PRE>So what you're saying is, if the output of Antlr consists of a mixture
of Antlr code and your GPL code, then the licence on your code (GPL)
trumps that of Antlr? I don't think so!

Okay, so Antlr's licence is GPL-compatible so in practice there is no
problem here, but as I read what you are saying, you are assuming that
you can ignore the licence on the Antlr code just because Antlr has
mixed your code in with it.

Let's give an example. I write a load of code-generator code that goes
into Antlr, and it's NOT GPL compatible (yes, I know, Ter would reject
it ... but let's assume he doesn't). You then run your grammar through
Antlr, and the result is a mixture of your code, my code, and other
peoples' code. Are you saying that your GPL licence trumps my licence? I
think you'll find the courts disagree very strongly.

Cheers,
Wol

 &gt;
 &gt; But when you feed a grammar into Antlr, the stuff that comes out (the
 &gt; lexer/parser) is NOT a translation. Most or all of it is *other*
 &gt; *people's* code, and is licenced the way THEY say, not you.


Not necesarily. You have the freedome to licence your code as you wish,
and 
for example to allow using only for making free software. This is not
GPL of 
course

 &gt; If your
 &gt; grammar contains code that makes its way into the lexer/parser, then
the
 &gt; lexer/parser has multiple licences


Nope. In case of GPL, lexer/parser must be GPL too. Period.

 &gt; and it is YOUR responsibility to
 &gt; avoid a licence clash.


Not.

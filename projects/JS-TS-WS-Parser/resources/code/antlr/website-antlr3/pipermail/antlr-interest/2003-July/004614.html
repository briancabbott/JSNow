<PRE>My first reaction was &quot;I didn't know about this rule&quot;, and then further
reading makes me suspect that's just because I've been writing a
grammar. I haven't dug into the geneerated code.

If (as I suspect) this rule applies to generated code, then the more
rules like this the better... :-) I sometimes work with generated code,
and the less effort you need to try to get to grips with what it's doing
the better. And the more naming conventions you have the better. I used
to work with Fortran, and always stuck rigidly to the default typing
rules, despite always also using the &quot;no undeclared variables&quot; switch on
the compiler. It reduces the brain overload when hunting down a bug :-)
So count me in as saying &quot;keep the rule&quot;, too.

Cheers,
Wol

</I>&gt;<i> I prefer the 
</I>&gt;<i> current approach, not only for visual effect (which is pretty 
</I>&gt;<i> important--highlighting is not an option for black-and-white text) 
</I>but 
&gt;<i> for catching rules moved from one type of grammar (lexer, parser, 
</I>tree 
&gt;<i> walker) to another.
</I>
I also think the present UpperCase or lowerCase case distinction 
should be preserved. 

It is simple and non-intrusive, it prevents accidental 
copying/pasting of rules from lexer to parser/treewalker (as Loring 
pointed out) and, the issue about method naming in the generated 
parsers can be resolved with a rulename-to-methodname transformation 
in ANTLR 3.

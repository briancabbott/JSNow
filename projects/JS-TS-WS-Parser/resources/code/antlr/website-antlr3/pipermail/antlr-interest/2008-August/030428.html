<PRE>Hi, Jim,

Thanks very much for your help

I tried to turn backtrack off before, but failed to build the grammar with a lot of errors, so I have to turn it on

    The following is the complete implementation of CREATE DATABASE of our Sybase parser, and it shows its structures. 
    The text in red below was added a few days ago when I found this problem. I commented it because they would introduce some other problems. God.... 
     
    Thanks

  Hmmm - backtrack = true isn't a good idea for something like SQL (or almost any production parser really) - this may be masking your issue, but I will look at this for you this weekend - apologies that I am too busy to look a this before then.

  Also, my own parser matches the comments in the lexer and places them on their own channel. You can then look for them in the tree walker if you need them.

<PRE>I *think* that gcc allows you to specifically disable certain warnings -
along the lines of &quot;warn everything except warning number 82&quot;. I suspect
that when I get things working the way I want, my screen will explode in
ambiguity warnings! The problem is that there might be one warning I
really need to see, and I miss it in the screeds of ambiguity crap I
can't suppress.

I'd suggest that you allocate numbers to all your warnings (you probably
do that already :-) and then print your warnings via a call to a central
routine. Then have some way of telling that routine that, if it's called
for warning(s) x, it should return without doing anything.

Cheers,
Wol

I would like a better way to manage all the warnings.  I don't
particularly
like the warnWhenAmbig=false flag.  For one it doesn't work for all the
cases I want it for. 

I think a companion tool could be better at annotating error messages
and
presenting new ones/hiding old ones, etc.  

An ANTLR Cookbook would be quite handy too, and could be built on top of
the
existing examples, and my C grammar :)

Of course there's a slew of tree things but Loring's got that covered
from
the design cabal.

Interactive parsers are not so fun with ANTLR 2.

I would like to be able to trace a Token all the way back to file
offsets so
I could modify files in place, not have to regenerate them entirely.
That's
not so easy with Unicode.

Folks,

In preparation for the ANTLR 3.0 whitepaper, I need to start writing 
down everything that annoys me about ANTLR 2.0.  I have started another 
&quot;blog&quot; document:

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/blog/antlr3/antlr2.bashing.tml">http://www.antlr.org/blog/antlr3/antlr2.bashing.tml</A>

Feel free to send in your pet peeves to me or to this list.  I will try 
to add to this file.

I can hear John Mitchell now: &quot;predicate hoisting!&quot; ;)

Terence

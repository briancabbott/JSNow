<PRE>Oh well, that won't cause me any grief then :-)

If my computer tries to find antlr.org down its ethernet cable, it's not
going to have much success, as it's just a crossover to my wife's pc!

Cheers,
Wol

There won't be any way to cancel it minus unplugging ethernet.  Just  
like TiVo ;)  Your only choice will be to wait until a real release.   
This release is only for the intrepid, believe me.  In exchange for  
early access people will provide me with info to make the real  
release better.  Another reason for the required nature is that to  
get any hope of a scientific sample, I cannot let people self select  
to send data or not.

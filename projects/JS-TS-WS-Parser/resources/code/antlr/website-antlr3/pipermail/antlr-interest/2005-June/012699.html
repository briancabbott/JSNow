<PRE>&gt;<i> Hi Jean,
</I>&gt;<i> Please excuse the abruptness of my previous two postings.
</I>&gt;<i> AntlrWorks is a great concept and I am looking forward to its first  
</I>&gt;<i> full release.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't expect positive comments, but I prefer when negative ones  
come with constructive comments ;-)

Concerning the coloring, I have no problem on my laptop (and Terence  
on his box) with many grammar files. I would be really happy if you  
could send me the grammar file which is causing these problems - it  
will help me to reproduce them (I have received some complains about  
the syntax coloring, but when I ask for an concrete example, I never  
get back an answer).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have another two suggestions
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i) Pressing the 'Submit Stats'  button locks up the GUI.
</I>&gt;<i> This action should be passed to a background thread for processing  
</I>&gt;<i> and the panel should close immediately.
</I>&gt;<i> My website has code and details on spawning background threads and  
</I>&gt;<i> handling their results for both Java V1.4 and V1.5
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.forward.com.au/javaProgramming/">http://www.forward.com.au/javaProgramming/</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> index.html#programming_with_java_threads
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I am already doing a lot of background threads ;-) But you are right  
that the submission should be done in the background: I have added  
this to my ToDo list!

&gt;<i> ii) I recommend you avoid error message (and confirmation) dialog  
</I>&gt;<i> boxes alltogther.  This like article says why and suggests some  
</I>&gt;<i> alternatives
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.forward.com.au/javaProgramming/javaGuiTips/">http://www.forward.com.au/javaProgramming/javaGuiTips/</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> dialogBoxes.html#dialog_boxes
</I>&gt;<i> I am sure you can think of others or more pleasing designs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is a delicate subject. I don't agree completely with your  
philosophy, but it is interesting. I am currently following (but  
there is some lack I recognize) the Apple Design Guidelines.

&gt;<i> As an adjunct to removing confirmation dialog boxes you need to  
</I>&gt;<i> provide a comprehensive undo/redo function (not just for edits) so  
</I>&gt;<i> the user can change their mind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
For what feature do you want a undo/redo aside from editing text ?  
Depending on the feature, I can add that in a future release.

Thanks a lot for your comments!

Jean

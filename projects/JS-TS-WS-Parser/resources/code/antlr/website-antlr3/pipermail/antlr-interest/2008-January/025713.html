<PRE>Solution to the problem:

&gt;<i>From examples of code for 2.7.x I see that Lexer used to be the
</I>ITokenSource. In 3.0 Lexer does not implement that interface any more.
Instead there is a shared state that carries this information. So,
instead of the private int type field in the myGenerateLexer I declared
	private int type
	{
		set{state.type=value;}
	}

This works; I can &quot;recognize&quot; things now.

Subject: [antlr-interest] CSharp 3.0 target

Kunle, 

I apologize if I should be writing to a different place... If so, could
you please let me know?

I've generated the Lexer and Parser but they do not compile. In Lexer I
find the this.type variable. I defined it locally for now, but it
obviously is not right. From debugging I understand that this is the
type of the token, but because it is private it does not propagate to
the right place. I also do not see it defined anywhere in Lexer or
BaseParser as non-private field. I see it as property of Token, but am
not sure how it is supposed to get there. 
What am I doing wrong?

I am using 3.0.1 version. 

Thank you much, 

Alexei

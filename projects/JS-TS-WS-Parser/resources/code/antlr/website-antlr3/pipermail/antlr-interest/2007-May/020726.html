<PRE>I am sure that Amazon don't update every book the instant that it is
available. Perhaps if Ter had called it &quot;Harry Potter and the
Non-Determinism&quot;, it would be different and be followed up with T-shirts
(hmmm! We should have T-Shirts on the web site, at least 10 people would
buy 'em ;-)) and a movie.

On the price difference:

1) If you are a student and can't get your father to buy it, then
perhaps you can stay out of the Union bar one night (UK/Australia/Etc)
and use the proceeds to buy the book? ;-) Or, if you are in the US, buy
the Chuck-Ts rather than the latest marketing (all programmers should
wear these anyway);
2) If you are not a student, then stay out of the Pub for two hours (UK
equivalent - 12 femtosconds) and use the proceeds to buy the more
expensive book;

Or, buy the cheaper version from Amazon and donate the $4.50 shipping
costs to Ter's paypal donation scheme (proceeds so far $2.34).

But for those on a tight budget, the difference betwen the $37 Pragmatic

Programmers' (plus $4.50 for shipping) and Amazon's $24.40 (with 
free &quot;Super Saver&quot; shipping available) is a bit hard to ignore. In 
fact, Amazon's paper book price is virtually identical to the Pragmatic 
PDF price!

I'm not sure why, but Amazon.com is still listing the book as available 
only for pre-order. Is Pragmatic holding out??


People considering the PDF version should probably first read 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/faqs/pdf_faq.html">http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/faqs/pdf_faq.html</A>&gt; (if 
they haven't already). The only real caveat is that even though the PDF 
itself does not (attempt to) prevent printing (only Adobe's Reader 
honors the content that encodes that restriction--other PDF viewing 
software does not), the formatting is not the same as that of a printed 
book and active hyperlinks (a good and useful thing) are just 
distractions when they appear on paper.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Enjoy.
</I>
One way or the other, I will.


&gt;<i> Ter
</I>&gt;<i> PS	you can buy PDF, printed, or both

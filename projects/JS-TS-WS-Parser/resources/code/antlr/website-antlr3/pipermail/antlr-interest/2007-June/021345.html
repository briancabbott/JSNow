Can you give any specific examples where the API was broken in recent 
years? In my experience *a lot* of effort is put in maintaining 
compatibility. Jetbrains would certainly want to hear it if something is 
broken.

As for the new, in-development, Groovy plugin running only on 7.0: 
perhaps the implementation uses new API features from IDEA 7.0?

Rails 1.2 requires a fairly recent version of Ruby, does that mean it 
has bad backward compatibility?

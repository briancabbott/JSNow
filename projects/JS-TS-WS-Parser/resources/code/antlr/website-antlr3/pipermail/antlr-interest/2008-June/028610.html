Well, that's always a danger with cut&amp;paste... I'm glad to hear the
fix is obvious.

 &gt;&gt; CSharp2 target doesn't have that problem, but has others:

 &gt; That isn't supposed to be necessary. I did explicitly test all cases

are 3 subdirectories: whole is my original grammar (with just the
target changed to CSharp2). Note the use of text in (for example)
MacroScopeLexer.mAsciiStringLiteral() - action { text = &quot;&quot;; } is

{
    text = &quot;&quot;;

 &gt; this an isolated problem? I once had to use .Text in 3.0.1, too,

 &gt; .Text would be translated failed to show up any result, a test

 &gt; things. But you could test if Java gives the same problems. I'll
Well, the Java target generates text - but isn't that correct for
Java? I think the problem is simply that org.antlr.runtime.Lexer has
protected String member text while Antlr.Runtime.Lexer has that data
in an instance of RecognizerSharedState...

 &gt;&gt; $token.type doesn't work at all: $type in the rule above generates
 &gt;&gt; compilable code which fails at runtime with NullReferenceException
 &gt;&gt; while $Type is just copied to the generated code, which therefore
 &gt;&gt; doesn't compile. What is the correct way to set an explicit token

Well, just a Vista (bloody unstable, but I don't think that could have 
any influence on ANTLR) with Java 1.6.0_03... My CLASSPATH is

- I suppose I could try pruning it, but I'm sceptical that would
change anything...

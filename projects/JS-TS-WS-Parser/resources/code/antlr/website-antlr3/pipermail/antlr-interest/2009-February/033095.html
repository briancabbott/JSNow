I had tried out several term-rewrite engines tools (stratego, txl, etc) a few years ago,
and I didn't find any of them to be better than just writing stuff like
this &quot;by hand&quot;. IIRC, they all seemed fine at simple stuff like &quot;x+0 -&gt; x&quot;, but
once you start putting in real-world requirements (&quot;for all values that might
evaluate to zero&quot;, &quot;as long as '+' hasn't been operator-overloaded&quot;) they got
pretty messy.

&gt;<i> Once you have such a generic function, indeed it looks interesting. If 
</I>&gt;<i> your application is built on top of a few of those, maybe this would 
</I>&gt;<i> also appeal to me. For our purposes, we need to recognize lots of 
</I>&gt;<i> patterns, that's why I prefer pattern matching :-)
</I>
Yes, of course you make the code modular and build up a library of useful
methods. I also have lots of patterns - hundreds - in my C-to-Java translator.
Some are simple enough that a simple pattern-match thing works:
printf(X) -&gt; sprintf(stdout, X)
...but others require a lot of code.

&gt;&gt;<i> I don't see how an ANTLR treewalker lets you make things modular (and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thus maintainable)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Me too. As said above, for transformations I would prefer patterns and a 
</I>&gt;<i> pattern-matching-engine.
</I>
As Terrence mentioned, he's working on something new. I'm also trying to
put together something new.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Also, you make yourself highly dependent on the underlying 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tree-model, which changed a lot from antlr2 to antlr3.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Assuming by &quot;tree-model&quot;, you mean the shape of the AST you're 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> creating, no,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that wouldn't (or shouldn't) change with the version of ANTLR that you're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using. You build the AST to be the shape that you want, regardless of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ANTLR version.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Have you used antlr3? In our application, the migration to antlr3 is a 
</I>&gt;<i> major effort. For example, an antlr2 AST node can be a singular node,or 
</I>&gt;<i> a node with a sibling, which has another sibling. So, it can be either a 
</I>&gt;<i> node or a list of nodes. If your code depends on this, you end up 
</I>&gt;<i> replacing many type definitions with List&lt;AST&gt;. Or you add the nodes you 
</I>&gt;<i> actually want to return to a dummy parent, return the first child of 
</I>&gt;<i> that parent, and let the caller find out if the returned node has a 
</I>&gt;<i> parent and if so, regard all its childs as the rest of the list. If you 
</I>&gt;<i> did not write your program in such a fashion, maybe the translation to 
</I>&gt;<i> antlr3 gets easier then. 
</I>&gt;<i> But still, there is a function called 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;setNextSibling&quot; in antlr2. How do you emulate that in antlr3? You have 
</I>&gt;<i> to distinguish lots of special cases to find out if it means: addChild, 
</I>&gt;<i> deleteChild, deleteRangeOfChildren .. whatever.
</I>
Yes, I've used antlr3, but I haven't actually converted an existing
ANTLR2-based app to ANTLR3. I tended to subclass most of the AST functionality
anyway (for example, hiding the nary-tree implemented as a binary tree
getFirstChild/getNextSibling thing). I see now how upgrading to
antlr3 could be a pain. I guess that's why I'm just sticking with antlr2
for now.

&gt;&gt;<i> I think &quot;hand-written&quot; code to walk an AST is less
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dependent on AST structure than an ANTLR treewalker is.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example, suppose I want to find all the ancestor nodes of type
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;INT&quot;. The &quot;hand-written&quot; code is something like:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> List&lt;AST&gt; nodes = someNode.findAncestorsOfType(MyLanguageTokenTypes.INT);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...while the ANTLR treewalker that does the same thing consists of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *entire* tree shape, with extra code added. The ANTLR treewalker forces
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you to specify much more info than you actually care about.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You could have only a basic tree walker and inherit from that, 
</I>&gt;<i> overriding only the places you want. So, if you have a lot more easy 
</I>&gt;<i> tree walkers, the single tree-walker copy of the antlr grammar is still 
</I>&gt;<i> a burden, but it only exists once.
</I>
But each time you change the structure of the AST, whatever treewalker grammar
you have is no longer valid. Michael has a handful (5-10) of AST-changing
rules, so ends up with a handful of grammars. I have many hundreds of
AST-changing rules. It's completely impractical to keep track of what a
valid AST looks like at each step.


&gt;&gt;<i> If by &quot;tree-model&quot; you mean the ANTLR syntax and semantics, then 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> obviously
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the &quot;hand-written&quot; treewalker is not dependent on it at all, while the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ANLTR treewalker is completely dependent on it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, there might be lots of syntactic changes, but I consider these a 
</I>&gt;<i> lot easier to deal with than a structural change of the internal tree 
</I>&gt;<i> representation, as was the case between antlr2-&gt;antlr3. And if you dont 
</I>&gt;<i> like treewalker's at all, then maybe generic visitors/combinators could 
</I>&gt;<i> be of interest to you (see JJtraveller).
</I>Do you have a link for JJtraveller? Google can't find it.
 

&gt;<i> Maybe it's possible to also 
</I>&gt;<i> write such a tool for antlr, so that, in effect, you get a 
</I>&gt;<i> base-tree-walker (without any actions) for free.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, although my mail contains lots of speculation, I hope it provides 
</I>&gt;<i> some ideas that seem useful to you :-)
</I>
Yes, thanks for the discussion!

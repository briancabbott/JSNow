<PRE>I said that you can't *sell* my work. You said you can *charge* for my
work. Where's the conflict?

And as for the &quot;definition of derivative&quot;, that's not the GPL's problem.
If, LEGALLY, your work is a derivative of a GPL work, then the GPL
applies. Because the GPL is a *licence*, then the meaning of the word
&quot;derivative&quot; is whatever your government says it is, and it's not in the
GPL's interest to try to (re)define it.

As for what happened with the phone call with RMS, I guess Ter said &quot;I
know what the GPL does, and it's not what I want&quot;. I can't see RMS
having a problem with that ...

Cheers,
Wol

Not quite - you can charge whatever you want for GPL'ed work, whoever 
wrote it. The GPL has nothing to do with money. Two quotes:

&gt;<i> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
</I>price.

&gt;<i> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
</I>&gt;<i> you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
</I>&gt;<i> fee.
</I>
Note that the second quote refers to any GPL'ed software - not, for 
example, your own work or your derivative of a GPL'ed work. There is no 
definition of what a fee is, and no statement that it should be 
'reasonable'.

The GPL has many problems, not the least of which is the definition of a

'derivative' work. It's not clear at what point you become obliged to 
distribute a copy of your own source code if you include any GPL'ed 
source in your code. That's why real-world commercial organisations 
don't like it. A second issue is that, if you do charge a lot of money 
to distribute your own (or someone else's) work, then there's nothing to

stop a third party also distributing that work for gratis.

IMHO, the GPL is simply a religious manifesto, and is a pile of crock. 
Ter has cut right through this with his own licence, which is a model of

simplicity and clarity. I would love to know what happened in that phone

conversation with Richard Stallman...

You did see my suggestion of adding a custom codegenerator to antlr and an
own support lib ? As long as you don't have to ship the antlr tool itself
this looks a valid option to me.

A manager would have to be seriously stupid not to consider that option
since retargetting a codegenerator for antlr is a lot less work than the 6
months work you guys spent in making your current parser. A small
calculation in costs will of course turn this in something even an
accountant can understand...

Cheers,

Ric

PS I'm once more *very* glad not to live in the states...
PPS Yes this kinda stuff annoys the hell out of me. My apologies for that
if needed.

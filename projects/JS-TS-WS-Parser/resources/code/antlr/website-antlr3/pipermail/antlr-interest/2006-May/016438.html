<PRE>Rodrigo,
 
Are you saying the the includeFile example doesn't work for you?. I haven't
had any issues [reported] to that effect. I just tried it again and it seems
to work just fine.
 
If you have Nant properly installed (and the .NET SDK), it probably best to
just type &quot;nant&quot; from the directory containing the example.
 
Just in case you're not, ANTLR V2 sometimes often raises exceptions fo
non-exceptional cases. So yes, it's normal for ANTLR V2.
 
Micheal

Hi Micheal,

Thank you for your help! I already checked that sample and I tried to
integrate on my compiler but it seems that something is wrong because the
selector.retry() is throwing TokenStreamRetryException in both places
(uponEOF() method and at INCLUDE production) is it normal? 

Im using Visual Studio 2005 and when I run the compiler, VS warns me telling
that the TokenStreamRetryException was thrown 2 times but if I continue with
the compilation it runs fine (it access the included file). Although if I
catch the TokenStreamRetryException for example: 

try 
{
         selector.retry();
}
catch (TokenStreamRetryException e)
{
         Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}

It prints the message but it doesnt access to the included file.

Is something that Im missing?

Cheers,

Rodrigo

Hi Rodrigo,
 
See the includeFile sample included with ANTLR. 
 
Cheers,

Subject: [antlr-interest] Wrapping input files to process multiple sources


Hello again and sorry for being repeated but i suppose that people from the
mailing list thought that someone already answered to my question because
Loring Craymer posted his question on my thread and so on, but unfortunetly
not. 


Im using ANTLR to generate a compiler in C# for a DSL and I would like to
know how to pass to the Lexer multiple input files (something similar to the
control of &quot;yyin&quot; using &quot;yywrap()&quot; in flex) in order to be able to switch
the source stream.

I know that I could concatenate all the input files in a stream and pass it
to the Lexer but I still want to know if ANTLR has some tool to prevent this
option.

This is a typical way to process &quot;&lt;include/import xpto&gt;&quot; files.

Regards,


Rodrigo

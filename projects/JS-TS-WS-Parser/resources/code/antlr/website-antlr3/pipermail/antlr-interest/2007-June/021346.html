I found a plug-in that (is meant to) allow opening of files from the 
command line&#8212;something I find very handy and use with jEdit all the 
time. It won't work in IDEA 6.0 because of non-backward-compatible API 
changes.


&gt;<i> As for the new, in-development, Groovy plugin running only on 7.0:

Perhaps.


&gt;<i> Rails 1.2 requires a fairly recent version of Ruby, does that mean it
</I>&gt;<i> has bad backward compatibility?
</I>
I don't know, but backward and forward compatibility aren't the same 
thing.


My understanding is that the JetBrains people have decided, given their 
limited developer resources and their rather ambitious plans, that 
backward compatibility is something they're willing to sacrifice to 
make their jobs manageable. I don't have a problem with that (backward 
compatibility can be like a stone around a developer's neck), but it 
has its consequences.

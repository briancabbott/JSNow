Yes, I get the impression that ANTLR lexers use a weaker recognition
strategy than ANTLR parsers. The problems seem to occur when you try to do
something in a lexer, that would work in a parser (with tokens in place of
characters) only because of the stronger recognition strategy.

However, I haven't been able to find documentation of what exactly the
difference is -- the description of LL(*) in the 'Definitive Guide'
chapter 11 does not seem to make a distinction between lexing and parsing.
(It does say that ANTLR does not generate ambiguity warnings for a lexer
that it would generate for a parser, instead preferring rules that are
specified first in the grammar. But that doesn't seem to be relevant to
this lookahead issue.)

<PRE>Hadn't considered multiplexing, but unfortunately I think that 
doesn't help. With mutliplexing, you need a token (well a rule) to 
tell it to kick over to the action lexer. But the problems is with 
distinguishing that token (rule).
Plus, even if that did work you'd have the problem of hooking 
multiplexing into the Netbeans incremental lexer framework, and it 
would be harder (if anything) than hooking in a token stream filter 
(which is how I implemented the subtoken stuff). You'd need to store 
some sort of virtual PUSH_LEXER and POP_LEXER tokens and have the 
incremental lexer handle them when it relexes.
Multiplexing is basically what Antlr does now. OK, it packs all the 
action stuff into a single token, but then it uses the action lexer 
to handle that, so it's not as clean an implementation but same basic 
idea.

&gt;<i> &gt; Terr was right, there was a good reason. Basically options 
</I>&gt;<i> section, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tokens section and actions are horribly ambiguous, partly due to 
</I>&gt;<i> the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; opacity of actions. The rules are:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OPTIONS: &quot;options&quot; (WS|COMMENT)* LCURLY; // Same for tokens
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ACTION: LCURLY (.*) RCURLY; // With extra stuff to handle RCURLY 
</I>&gt;<i> in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comment\string literal etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, if you see a LCURLY it's really hard to know what to do. Is 
</I>it 
&gt;<i> an 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; action where you want to swallow everything pretty 
</I>&gt;<i> indescriminantly 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or the start of a tokens\options block where you can actually 
</I>&gt;<i> parse 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what's inside?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The solution used in Antlr is to match &quot;options&quot; (WS|COMMENT)* 
</I>&gt;<i> LCURLY 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in RULEDEF (lowercase starting identifiers).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to re-lex &quot;options&quot; as a ruleDef not an OPTIONS_BLOCK (left to 
</I>&gt;<i> right) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; etc. So, what you really need to do is recognise it as a single 
</I>&gt;<i> block 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and record 'subtokens' for the various parts. That way the re-
</I>&gt;<i> lexing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stuff treats it as one token but you can pull the various parts 
</I>&gt;<i> out. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hence you want a way to return multiple tokens from a single 
</I>rule. 
&gt;<i> Or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you can make a custom token class to store subtokens, but then 
</I>you 
&gt;<i> &gt; have a problem hooking into the incremental lexer. After lexing 
</I>&gt;<i> you 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need to unpack the subtokens for subsequent stuff and then repack 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them back up for the incremental lexer, meaning you need to 
</I>&gt;<i> hookinto 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the lexer. I managed to hack the Netbeans lexer to support non-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; restartable tokens and that kinda worked. There was some problem 
</I>&gt;<i> in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there (incremental and batch lexing was slightly different in a 
</I>&gt;<i> few 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cases) but seemed to get the right stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ideally you might try and leave it to the parser, but the opacity 
</I>&gt;<i> of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actions makes that not possible, there can be stuff in an action 
</I>&gt;<i> that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is not lexable (unless you made a new Antlr lexer for every 
</I>action 
&gt;<i> &gt; language).

</I>&gt;<i> The

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code from 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the options/tokens name-value pairs. My solution was to 
</I>&gt;<i> introduce a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; state

<PRE>I tried sending this mail yesterday, but it has been stopped, as it has
crossed allowed mail size limit.  So i am sending the files without the
antlr-3.4.jar

Thanks,
Gokul

Hi,
   I am attaching the updated C++ Target files. I have checked with all the
examples except the first one &quot;C&quot;. I am attaching the files for two -
dynamic_scope and composite_java. Of Course it won't work with TreeParsers.
I have tested it on a 64 bit system on Windows and Linux. (Visual Studio
2010 and g++ 4.4.6).
   I have also attached the antlr-3.4.jar built with the modified Cpp.stg
and CppTarget.java. You can use it for testing. As previously said you need
to define a Traits file. There is a second restriction that has added. In
the generated Parser, the lexer has to get included. So in all the
grammars, you have to write
@parser::include { #include &lt;lexer.h&gt; }

I cannot get away with it, because of the filtering mode option, which
becomes a compile time parameter. But its available only for the Lexer. So
i define it as a trait in the Lexer and in order for Parser to invoke
nextToken method, it has to access that Trait.

The C++ Target also supports island grammars. Anyone can find it how it has
been done by looking at Traits.hpp. Feel free to contact me to ask for any
other examples / help.  Looking forward for the feedback.

Terence,
      Can you please let me know, whether its possible to put it out in the
website as a C++ Target? Please let me know, the stuffs i have to complete
in order to be there. I know i have to write some readme.txt docs.


Thanks,
Gokul.

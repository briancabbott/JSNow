Hi,

[i posted this email to <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/blog/antlr3/trees.tml">http://www.antlr.org/blog/antlr3/trees.tml</A> ]

After Loring bitched at me on the phone yesterday &lt;snicker&gt;, I'm 
beginning to think he's right:  if separating the node data from the 
navigation is the right concept, then trees should be a single 
implementation that simply carry a &quot;payload&quot; object defined by the 
user.  This is like Sun's MutableTreeNode.

The interesting thing is that the tree nodes themselves are all 
homogeneous, but the payload object could be totally different at each 
node.  So, the parser creates exactly one kind of node with a variety 
of payload (or a single) types. The payload can be defined in the 
grammar itself so that ANTLR can generate the required type(s).

grammar P;

AST {
	Token token; // probably a default field
	String blort;
	...
}

Then ANTLR would generate P_AST type for use when building trees.  For 
heterogeneous trees, we currently allow type names in the tokens 
section:

tokens {
	ID&lt;AST=IDASTNode&gt;; //something like that
	...
}

If we allow field specifications, that is better than specifying a type 
name maybe:

tokens {
	ID&lt;String name, int n&gt;;
	...
}

Whatever.  A random idea.

As a bonus to the payload strategy, we can enhance the tree 
functionality later w/o forcing alterations in people's application; 
their payload objects still fit in our nodes.

This all comes at the cost of an additional object creation (payload 
creation + node creation).

Side note: Mitchell suggested Tokens and Tree nodes should have not 
only fixed fields like this, but the ability to dynamically acquire 
&quot;attributes&quot;; this would basically be a hashmap.  It cuts down on a 
bazillion subclasses.  It would be useful when parsing xml for example. 
  The TAG token could have a list of tag attributes w/o creating 
subclasses etc...

</I>&gt;<i> Given ANTLRs very good inbuilt AST support I can't see many reasons to
</I>&gt;<i> not use this if you are building an AST. You can produce any sort of
</I>&gt;<i> output tree you want. And can still use custom AST building code with
</I>&gt;<i> output=AST. Though ANTLRs tree construction operators and rewrite
</I>&gt;<i> rules mean this is rarely difficult.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>One cases (abet not common) would be where the programmer is trying to 
generate faster (or less memory intensive) code. By taking total control 
of the AST I can build the final AST that /I/ want in the first pass 
rather than in another pass with a tree parser. this would allow total 
control over the node types and also allow the use of much less generic 
constructs. I also suspect that the added complexity of the 2 pass 
system (at first) is more than the removed complexity of not having to 
generate the AST stuff my self, especially because I will more than 
likely do just that in the tree parser.

&gt;&gt;<i> the part I'm dissatisfied with is the front page. As I see it there are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a few critical pieces of information that need to be added (or be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> obversely linked  from it) these include a 2-3 sentence description of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what antler expects the user to do (&quot;Antlr is a system for building
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recognizers, token parsers and tree parsers. It is designed to be used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to build token parsers from language agnostic grammars that are then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> used to feed language specific tree parsers to perform the custom data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> operations. &lt;verbiage about StringTemplate&gt; While it can operate in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other modes these are what it is intended to do.&quot;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> Well, it's likely any such description\page would still have given the
</I>&gt;<i> impression that ANTLR was suitable for what you wanted.
</I> From what you said, ANTLR is suitable for what I want, in theory just 
not in practices. But saying that the major use profile is something 
else would have bean a huge hit as to my problems. I tend to be a 
minimalist when learning things. I learn the absolute minimum I can to 
get started and then learn stuff as I need it to do what I need. If 
something about ANTLR being designed to generate AST building code had 
bean on the front page (or there abouts) I would have gone and looked 
for that info rather than skip it because I didn't see how I needed it.

&gt;<i>  It is designed
</I>&gt;<i> to be it was just the implementation was lagging behind, and the lack
</I>&gt;<i> of usage meant this hadn't been as major a concern as such problems in
</I>&gt;<i> other areas might have been.
</I>&gt;<i> But certainly such a comparison page in the wiki sounds like a good idea.

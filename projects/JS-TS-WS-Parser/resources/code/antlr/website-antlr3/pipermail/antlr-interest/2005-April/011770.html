<PRE>Bryan,
   thanks for your response.  I'm trying to understand the best way to
use the tool.  It's not always straight forward.

If I understand you correctly, I need two different tokens: one, defined
in the lexer, to represent the symbol (e.g., EQ1: '=') and another,
defined in the parser, to represent the keyword (tokens: EQ2=&quot;EQ&quot;.  And
then, in the parser, I would need to test for all posibilities, e.g.
  relationalExpr: term (EQ1 | EQ2 | LT1 | LT2 | GT1 | GT2 ...) term

Is this correct?

It /is/ a lexer rule.  Since &quot;eq&quot; looks like an /identifier/, it's
easiest to assume it's an identier and then correct that assumption
with a lookup table, as previously suggested.

You can certainly do what you like with the tools, but the facility
provided for keyword recognition (things like &quot;for&quot;, &quot;while&quot;,
&quot;integer&quot;, etc) is exactly the facility that fits your needs here for
the keyword &quot;eq&quot;:
   IDENT options {testLiterals=true;} ...
   // i.e., report the appropriate literal
   // if any is found (e.g., &quot;eq&quot; =&gt; EQ, &quot;for&quot; =&gt; FOR),
   // otherwise report that an IDENT was found

At another level, consider that error messages from the parser may
actually care whether it was &quot;eq&quot; or &quot;=&quot; - imagine the user's
confusion if you reported an error at a nonexistent token.

Another alternative, if you'd rather, is to run it thru cpp with:
   #define eq =
   #define ne !=
   ...

Hope this helps,
- Bryan

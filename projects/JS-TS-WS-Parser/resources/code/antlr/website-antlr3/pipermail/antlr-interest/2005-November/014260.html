I'll look forward to the example. In this case it will be enough if it's
a .g file that generates code it doesn't need to compile. (if it does
it's nice though)

&gt;<i> Secondly, I sincerely hope you are NOT Serious when you say: QUOTE:

There's a difference between prioritizing it in a way *you* don't like
and neglecting. We can spent our time bughunting much more efficiently
with a clue where to look if we get a snippet that triggers the problem.

&gt;<i> Thrirdly, the workaround is not good performance wise.
</I>
But it 'works'. E.g. you can continue developing. Not in an optimal way
but you can.

&gt;<i> What's worst, is that as long as the Bug is there, you really do not
</I>&gt;<i> knows when it bites you: The only way to find out, is to try BOTH with
</I>&gt;<i> and without Bitsets whenever a piece of code does not parse as expected.
</I>&gt;<i> THAT IS NOT a good solution timewise, and ANTLR is supposed to save us
</I>&gt;<i> time, isn't it?
</I>
Well develop with bitsets turned off? Or modify your build to create
both versions so you can directly see if the behaviour differs between
the two. Producing a snippet that triggers the bug is probably more time
efficient though.

Anyway shouting at eachother won't solve anything.

Cheers,

Ric

</I>I assume you mean here that you would have just gone ahead and plugged 
in the &quot;calculate n&quot; code at the appropriate place in your grammar.

It might help to see my perspective if you realize:
* I didn't write the grammar. I use Monty's C grammar, and so I've 
avoided learning much about ANTLR.
* I'm now in beta trial on a COBOL-to-Java translator and a C++-to-Java 
translator. I bet I wrote the whole
   COBOL-to-Java translator in less time than those couple of poor souls 
who are trying to create an ANTLR COBOL grammar.
* I'll almost certainly need to &quot;calculate n&quot; at other places in the 
tree sooner or later. It makes no sense at all to me to put &quot;calculate 
n&quot; code
  at one place in the grammar, and then keep having to repeat that. Even 
an AST lets me avoid that (with some kind of
  getChildCount()).
* If you haven't worked with a grammar the size of the C grammar, you 
probably don't have a feel for how awkward embedding
  actions is. And the C++ and COBOL (if ever finished) are even larger.
* Nothing makes you really want to avoid learning ANTLR (or anything 
else new)
   like a large and impossible project with an unreasonable deadline. :)

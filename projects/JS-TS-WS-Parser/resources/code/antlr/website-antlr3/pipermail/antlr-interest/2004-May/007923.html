<PRE>&gt;<i> For enclosure (scope, right?), you can keep track of that while parsing -

Hello, Robin!

Thanks for answer. I thinking about 3 stages too, but was not confident it.
pass 1- just collecting info about nested types, namespaces and base classes
(names only).
pass 2 - resolve base classes names and members types.
pass 3 - parse function bodies.
Right?

Another question. What better: on first and second pass generate only entity
model and on third pass generate AST with fully resolved entities. Or
generate AST on first pass and then resolve entity refrences on second and
third passes? For C# 1.x second variant is better because it has only two
syntax examples that can be pure syntactly resolved (and may simply fixed
with minor changes in AST tree on third pass). But in C# 2.0 introduce more
syntax ambiguity and AST conversions may not so simple.

Alex.

 &gt;Sure, codegen takes a second, and compiling to bytecode takes
 &gt;another second.  So what?  Small price for knowing it's right.
 &gt;Ok, but what about drawing concrete syntax trees?  No problem,
 &gt;just insert actions.

Either I'm misinterpreting what you're talking about, or you're 
describing what the ANTLRWorks debugger already does.

 &gt;In fact, it might even be possible to make predicates work in
 &gt;such an interp, by either &quot;gating off&quot; the callbacks or just
 &gt;&quot;marking in the debugger&quot; when we're processing a predicate.

The problem with predicates is that they're arbitrary target 
language code; ANTLR simply doesn't have enough information to 
emulate their functionality (for semantic predicates, at least; 
syntactic predicates could be dealt with correctly).  But that's 
what the Debug Remote feature is for.

<PRE>OK, now I kinda see the problem.  Thing is, you didn't post your tree parser
rules so I can't tell why you are having problems in your tree parser.  For
the first example, is &quot;END&quot; a statement that statement_list can match?

OK, now, in this rule you turned tree building off and you are creating a
root called stlist with no children because #statement_list is empty since
you turned off tree building, just what I would expect to happen.  You
almost got the idiom right, just turn tree building back on for the rule.

statement_list! 
        : ( (statement_line (EOL!)+ )+ ) 
        { #statement_list = #(#[STLIST,&quot;stlist&quot;], #statement_list); } 
        ; 

Make it 
statement_list 
        : ( (statement_line (EOL!)+ )+ ) 
        { #statement_list = #(#[STLIST,&quot;stlist&quot;], #statement_list); } 
        ; 

By the way there is a shorthand for #current_rule, which is ## 

statement_list
        : ( (statement_line (EOL!)+ )+ ) 
        { ## = #(#[STLIST,&quot;stlist&quot;], ##); } 
        ;

Carrying on from my last problem... now I've got rid of the
non-determinism... 
If my parser contains the definition: 
        statement_line : (statement ( SEMI! statement)* ) ; 
        statement_list : ( (statement_line (EOL!)+ )+ ) ; 
I seem to get the tree I expect namely 
        ( PROGRAM SHELL (LOOP (PRINT...) (INPUT ...) (PRINT ...)  ...)
(PRINT ...) END ) null 
when I print out the tree using 
        System.out.println( &quot;printing AST&quot;); 
        AST result = parser.getAST(); 
        System.out.println(result.toStringList()); 
BUT the treeparser chokes on it. It's expecting &quot;PROGRAM&quot; ID statement_list
&quot;END&quot;. It seems to me it's expecting a single &quot;statement_list&quot;, and when fed
the expanded list as above it chokes because it gets a LOOP. So I changed
the definition of statement_list to
statement_list! 
        : ( (statement_line (EOL!)+ )+ ) 
        { #statement_list = #(#[STLIST,&quot;stlist&quot;], #statement_list); } 
        ; 
which now gives me 
        ( PROGRAM SHELL stlist END ) null 
when I print the tree. The treeparser chokes on this, because it seems my
statement_list has become a root with no sibs or children or whatever - my
loop, print etc have got lost :-( Apologies if this seems simple - I seem to
have been asking question after question on the list, but I've been tearing
my hair out of the syntax of &quot;statement_list!&quot;. Is it right? And if so, why
doesn't &quot;toStringList()&quot; traverse it?
Cheers, 
Wol

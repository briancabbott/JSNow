Hi thanks for the update, I will try and turn off the auto-update. Unfortunately I cannot give out the grammar for troubleshooting due to company policy.

Thanks for your offer but I think this is something I myself need to do since it is part of my job. I don't currently have any firm requirement to convert to v3 but it will come next year so I was just investigating how much work it would be by some hands-on research. 

Do you have any tips in how to approach the problem of converting a grammar, would be grateful for any pointers there. e.g. starting with this then doing that :)

Best regards
Anders

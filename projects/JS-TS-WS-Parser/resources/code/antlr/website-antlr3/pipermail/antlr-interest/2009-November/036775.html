<PRE>Try:

 

expression

  : andexpression (opand^ andexpression)*

;

 

opand

 : OP_ AND -&gt; OP_AND

|<i> -&gt;OP_AND
</I>
;

 

Which will be fine so long as your and expressions are not ambiguous without the AND keyword. I suggest defaulting operators is always fraught with danger though as no one can remember if it means OR or AND and some people will never actually know ;-)

Subject: [antlr-interest] Problems with implicit &quot;and&quot; in query grammar build using Antlr

 

Hi all.

I have been building a google-like query syntax parser in ANTLR (C#). This is the first work I have done with ANTLR, or any parser generator, so it has been quite an experience.

I want the user to be able to use &quot;and&quot; and &quot;or&quot; to combine search terms e,g. &quot;(apple or microsoft) and tablet and office&quot;. But I also want the user to be able to enter a simple set of words and implicitly treat it as though they are joined by &quot;and&quot; e.g. &quot;apple tablet office windows&quot; would be treated as &quot;apple and tablet and office and windows&quot;

So far, I have been unable to get a syntax that correctly handles implicit &quot;ands&quot; between sets of words.

Here is a snippet of my current grammar that works properly with an explicit &quot;and&quot;:

expression
    : andexpression (OR_OP^ andexpression)*
    ;

andexpression
options {
backtrack=true;
}
    : atom (AND_OP^ atom)*
    ;

The problem is that I need the &quot;and&quot; to form the root of the AST subtree, which doesn't go well if the &quot;and&quot; isn't actually there. Even with lookahead/backtrack I can't find the right syntax to make it work.

In wanting the AND_OP to be optional, I had to move away from the tree construction operators because the following would not work:

andexpression
    : atom (AND_OP?^ atom)*
    ;

Ideally, I thought I needed to make andexpression look like this:

andexpression
options {
backtrack=true;
}
    : l=atom (AND_OP? r=atom)* -&gt; ^(AND_OP $l $r?)+
    ;

But I get RewriteEmptyStreamException parsing strings where words are not joined by 'and', for example &quot;sheep dog fish&quot;.

If anybody has any tips on how to make my &quot;and&quot; optional, it would be much appreciated.

Regards

Allen Jones

<PRE>FYI, the gazelle parser project (prototype) also aims at something 
similar, with slightly different syntax. Having non-greedy parsing in 
ANTLR also at the grammar level would be really useful, especially for 
languages without reserved identifiers. But I guess it's not an easy 
hack that one would do over a weekend.

</I>&gt;<i> The real issue with '.*' and '.+' is of course trading off the increase of
</I>&gt;<i> confusion that beginning ANTLR users already have over the whole issue of
</I>&gt;<i> greedy/nongreedy with the need for expert users to specify grammar rules
</I>&gt;<i> concisely. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problems with this tiny piece of the language, the fact that you raised
</I>&gt;<i> the issue rather than just doing it, and the fact that several people have
</I>&gt;<i> taken the time to bother about replying to your note, leads me to think that
</I>&gt;<i> the whole greedy/nongreedy distinction is important, and it therefore needs
</I>&gt;<i> to be raised to a higher level and not buried in the options. Also note that
</I>&gt;<i> it is an option that applies only to iterative subrules and therefore is an
</I>&gt;<i> integral part of iteration. My limited experience with ANTLR does not give
</I>&gt;<i> me any special authority to make the following recommendation, so take it as
</I>&gt;<i> a strong statement made to clearly raise the issue for your consideration: 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Every time we look at an iterative subrule, we need to be reminded whether
</I>&gt;<i> it is greedy or nongreedy; that is, we need separate operators for greedy
</I>&gt;<i> vs. nongreedy iteration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest deprecating the current notation and using:
</I>&gt;<i>   (...)** and (...)++ for greedy
</I>&gt;<i>   (...)|* and (...)|+ for nongreedy 
</I>&gt;<i>     (or some other notation that indicates &quot;stop me, quick&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know this is a change to the whole tradition of EBNF and regular
</I>&gt;<i> expressions, so your thoughts, flames, and groans will all be appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>

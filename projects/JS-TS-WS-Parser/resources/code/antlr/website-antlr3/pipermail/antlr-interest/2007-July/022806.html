<PRE>So if ANTLR generates recursive descent lexers, why are there so many things
about DFAs in the generated code (shouldn't I be seeing PDAs all over the
place instead)? When I see that I automatically think regular language +
NFAs and that means it should be able to automagically pick the right
accept/reject state for the tokens.

As for looking at the wiki, I did, and there was a Java example with setText
and getText (if you mean about the !), which aren't applicable to C# since
we have a Text setter/getter property instead. For parsing decimals I don't
recall anything like this problem unless it was hidden in one of the
tutorials.

Thanks,
Igor

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Thanks for all the help. I used a syntactic predicate like Jim
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suggested
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and it seems to lex everything properly now. I wish I understood
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; academically why my original lexing syntax didn't work, does ANTLR
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; put the tokens back and backtrack when it fails to match a rule?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Backtracking has to be explicitly activated because this option is
</I>&gt;<i> more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time consuming than a straight pass.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This was a lexing question. Igor is asking why ANTLR does not generate
</I>&gt;<i> code that acts like {f}lex in that you can get through a matching
</I>&gt;<i> sequence and then decide to YYREJECT; manually or the algorithm will
</I>&gt;<i> give up and try the next rule and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR generates recursive descent recognizers and so there is no [neat]
</I>&gt;<i> way to pop back up the recognition chain and start again. In practice,
</I>&gt;<i> this just means you have to get your head around it until you have
</I>&gt;<i> expunged {f}lex from your brain. It creates some lexing problems which
</I>&gt;<i> are difficult to solve until you have the gestalt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The easiest way is look at your tokens, merge common roots and write the
</I>&gt;<i> lexing rule so that it branches where the tokens will differ then uses
</I>&gt;<i> an action to set the type. You don't need to go to this trouble for
</I>&gt;<i> keywords with common roots 'call' 'calling' etc, but when you are
</I>&gt;<i> constructing compounds like INT.INT in the lexer and INT.xxx can mean
</I>&gt;<i> something else, then you need to guide the lexer analysis a bit. It may
</I>&gt;<i> not be exactly intuitive (at least not at first) but if you start
</I>&gt;<i> looking at the generated code, then as a programmer it may help you to
</I>&gt;<i> see what is happening, even if you don't a have a firm grasp of the
</I>&gt;<i> theory.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ter has recently stated that he may look at the algorithm in order to
</I>&gt;<i> make it generate some of the 'intuitive' cases as one might expect. Of
</I>&gt;<i> course, that will screw up those of us that have got used to the way it
</I>&gt;<i> is ;-)

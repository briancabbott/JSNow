Yup. What's really sad is that often these people who are so clever that 
they think
they can out-optimize a compiler write all that code by hand and never 
go back to
do thorough benchmarking to see if they've accomplished anything. Then they
keep their hand-written code, and years later someone else is sick of 
maintaining
it, so takes out the optimization and...

Poof! It's just as fast any maybe faster!

Brian Kernighan once said &quot;If you ever come across a section of your 
code that you find
particularly clever, strike it out and do it again&quot;. I'm not sure if 
that's the exact quote,
but it's pretty close.

Andy :)

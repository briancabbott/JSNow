<PRE>Martin,

I would /love/ to use/test a ANTLR 3.4 Ruby target, but alas at the 
moment I do not have the bandwidth to /do/ or even /fix/ the Ruby target.

One of the target platforms for my particular ANTLR3 grammar's use will 
be Ruby, however I have decided to make a Ruby 1.9 C code extension 
library using Jim Idle's C generator.  (Principally because my /main/ 
platform will be a C code PHP extension library for use on webservers).

 From my very brief dive into the C target's StringTemplates (looking 
for phase differences between the official download and the gitHub 
versions), I can say that the inter-relations between the templates may 
be a bit confusing at first.

To echo Eric, you /will/ understand Antlr3 a whole lot better when you 
have &quot;finished&quot;.

I suspect most ports are based upon the collection of StringTemplates 
which generate the Java version and then tweaked as needed.

Regards,

Stephen Gaito

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ANTLR v4 release is rapidly approaching. The beta of the reference book
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be out next week and the remaining two or three chapters should appear
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> within a month or so afterwards. Sam Harwell and I have been working very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hard on the tool itself and we should have 4.0 ready by the time the book
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> goes final. In the meantime, 4.0b1 will be available for use with the beta
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> book. Oh, and we need to release 3.4.1 before 4.0.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I have paid for a new website design for both ANTLR and StringTemplate,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which looks great. We will continue to use the same wiki software for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documentation. The current website is generated by a Java server I built
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whereas the new one is going to be static so I have less software to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maintain. In other words,  rather than using some kind of include mechanism
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to get the general look and feel on each page, the new websites will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simply static files on the disk.  The current antlr.org content will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> become antlr3.org, leaving the current domain pointing at v4 content.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We currently have functionality on the websites to accept new grammars
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and filesharing and articles and so on. Because this is so infrequent, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think it's reasonable to simply have an HTML form that has an email action
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instead of an HTTP POST. When I get those requests, I can simply add them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the file on the server. (will that use the user's local mail client or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will it force people to set up mail in their actual browsers before it will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> email me? does anybody know?)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> On to the grammar repository. Because it's likely we'll want to make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fixes / updates to existing grammars, I don't think a simple form / email
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mechanism is the best solution. Right now, I have to go in and overwrite /
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> update a number of files for a grammar update. Naturally, this screams for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a revision control solution. I was thinking that we might as well just use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> github for this so that anybody can add or modify the publicly available
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grammars.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> There are a number of issues with using github for this. First, I would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not want to create a new repository for each grammar so we would have one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> repository holding all grammars. This is pretty coarse granularity.  On the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other hand, if you just want one grammar, you can download individually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from github. The second issue is that we would really have to have a single
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> license for all grammars in the repository. I would hate for a GPL grammar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to get its stank on the other grammars. It would confuse people to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multiple licenses within a single repository. Thirdly, not everyone is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> comfortable with assembly language&#8230;er&#8230;I mean git. In that case, people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could simply mail me a grammar for inclusion. It would only take me a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> second to add it. The fourth problem. We need a clean URI for grammars and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I propose:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/grammars/&lt;name">http://www.antlr.org/grammars/&lt;name</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for the root directory of that project. For example,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/grammars/java">http://www.antlr.org/grammars/java</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would point out a directory that contains Java.g4 and may be a test
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> program or something.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I could easily add a redirect in the tomcat configuration files,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> assuming I can stomach all of that filthy XML, but that does not scale very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well when people add grammars. Instead, perhaps the best solution is to set
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up a cronjob that pulls from the grammar repository and leaves the grammars
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on antlr.org's disk so that /grammars URI points at that directory. That
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way, the URIs would always be up-to-date with the repository and without me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> having to do any work. Heh, that just might work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/grammars">http://www.antlr.org/grammars</A> by itself could redirect to the github
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, If you have any thoughts on this stuff, please reply.

<PRE>(note that this was foolishly asked in my other thread, little was i
thinking -- since most people wisely skip the &quot;thanks, d00d&quot; messages.
 I apologize to all the people who DID read it, and thank you all for
your patience, which i won't try anymore:  on with the message!)

The input for my parser may consist of &quot;folded&quot; text - basically, some
lines that are beyond a reasonable length will be wrapped with leading
whitespace indicating that their values are to be unfolded and treated
as all one piece.

So how do i look for that? I was originally handling it by filtering
the input, but that was messing with my linefeeds and CRs, so i'd like
to handle it in the parser. Essentially what i want is to return a
single token, call it VALUE, that takes everything from the first &quot;:&quot;
on a line to the first ENDL character that is not followed by some
whitespace.

Can this even be done?

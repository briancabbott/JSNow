</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I showed you my grammar yesterday.  Now trying it out on some simple
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> inputs blows me away right away: it doesn&#8217;t even parse anything.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Your problem seems to be with your Lexer rule for LABEL which is :
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> LABEL : ~(')')+ ;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this means that any sequence of characters that is not a ')' must be a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> LABEL.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I am starting to understand the difference between lexer and parser now.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  I was thinking of it as some sort of regular expression parser, but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> since the lexer does not know anything about the parser, it doesn&#8217;t care
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> about it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> another problem is that ')' is not matched by any Lexer rule. did you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> want OPEN and CLOSE to be parens?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, sorry, a relict of debugging.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Grateful for any suggestions,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> .....remainder of message snipped....
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hope this helps
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It did, in that I know what is wrong, but I still have no solution to my
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> problem: how can I make the variable in my label rule be anything?  That
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is, I would think anything except whitespace and braces and control
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> characters would be fine.  In particular, it definitely has to accept
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> any word in any script, along with some punctuation characters such as .
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - _ $ and probably more.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are a couple of solutions, but you don't say what the lexical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> significance of your labels are, or whether this is a language you are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inventing (in which case don't do that), or one you are following a spec
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I like your suggestion: don&#8217;t do that!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I am following a spec, but I am free to change it.  Although I
</I>&gt;<i> cannot believe why this wouldn&#8217;t be possible: I simply want a lisp-like
</I>&gt;<i> grammar that takes whatever is there.  See my other posts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Expected input: (word x whatever), where whatever can be really
</I>&gt;<i> anything, in particular, any word in any human language, so also
</I>&gt;<i> Chinese, etc.  And additionally, some punctuation should be allowed.
</I>&gt;<i> The &#8216;whatever&#8217; is clearly defined though: it starts after the space and
</I>&gt;<i> ends before the brace.  It would be a piece of cake to write this as a
</I>&gt;<i> regex: /[^ ][^)]*/, but unfortunately, as John pointed out, if I would
</I>&gt;<i> make a lexer rule out of this, it would eat everything, also the (word,
</I>&gt;<i> which of course should not be matched.  I think the lexer rules are
</I>&gt;<i> stupid, it shoul simply apply the rules in order of appearance, I see
</I>&gt;<i> absolutely no reason for this &#8216;rule which eats most wins&#8217; system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In general, such labels tend to be valid in certain places only, such as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the start of a line/statement, only following goto and so on. If this is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the case, then you use a semantic predicate to check if you are at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first character position in a line, then consume everything up to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whitespace and return LABEL. After goto and gosub, then consume the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> label spec within the definitions of such keywords, make the text of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> token be the label, and extract the label from the token in the parser.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You just have to think creatively about the trigger points that indicate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a label is/could be, next.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This seems like the way to go.  Could you write this down in newbie
</I>&gt;<i> words please?  While I can make some sense of it, it is too abstract to
</I>&gt;<i> be able to implement it yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What language is this? This knowledge may help people help you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I describe it at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://tcl.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/MonaSearch/doc/#formula-syntax,">http://tcl.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/MonaSearch/doc/#formula-syntax,</A> but note
</I>&gt;<i> that I can change that if need be.  I would prefer not to, since it
</I>&gt;<i> would break existing formulas, but there are not so many of them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If there are no lexical points that trigger a label interpretation, then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the next best thing is to construct a parser rule that accumulates label
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> components:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> label : WORD ( { checkNoSpace() }?=&gt; labelstuff )* ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have been wondering what this =&gt; in some grammars is.  Where can I
</I>&gt;<i> read about it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> labelstuff
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        : WORD | DOT | UNDERSCORE | BANG | keywords ... ;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then build the text of the label from the text of the individual tokens
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and rewrite as a LABEL for the AST.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can't be any more specific without knowing what you are trying to parse.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You usually have to look for specific solutions for your DSL when you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get in to this stuff as usually it means the language design was weak in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the first place.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose it is.  I think I should start using quoted strings.  But it
</I>&gt;<i> is also a very educational discussion which, to me is showing off some
</I>&gt;<i> of ANTLR&#8217;s weaknesses (such as no \p{alpha} classes).
</I>
Maybe someone can give some general suggestion on how to tackle this
issue?  I think I should make a more general ID lexer rule and indeed
check whether it is a proper first or second order variable in the
parser rules instead of having separate lexer rules for that.

More suggestions?  And what is =&gt; really?

<PRE>Hi Jim, that is not my problem, let me show you an example

I want to have a scoped value which is a structure, and my structure holds
some std::strings

struct MyStruct
{
  std::string s1;
  std::string s2;
};

//this is part of my grammar
myrule
scope {MyStruct s;} //scoped VALUE
@init{}
@after{}
:<i> rulegoeshere....;
</I>
As you can see, there is no pointer here, the scoped variable is a 'value'.
The code generated by antlr creates a scoped wrapper structure that holds
MyStruct, something like:

ctx-&gt;pMyParser_myruleTop = pMyParser_myrulePush(ctx); // this will create a
wrapper for the scoped value by calling ANTLR3_MALLOC

the wrapper looks like this:

typedef struct  MyParser_myrule_SCOPE_struct
{
    void    (ANTLR3_CDECL *free)    (struct MyParser_myrule_SCOPE_struct *
frame);
    MyStruct s;
}

As you can see my struct is inside this structure. The problem is that to
create the wrapper (see pMyParser_myrulePush above)
antlr calls ANTLR3_MALLOC (which does malloc of course).

THIS MEANS I'M GONNA GET A CRASH!

Why? because std::string is a c++ class, which HAS to be created/destroyed
using new/delete, not malloc/free.

That means, I cannot use a scoped VALUE, I have to use a scoped POINTER
instead, as suggested here:

<A HREF="http://www.mail-archive.com/il-antlr-interest@googlegroups.com/msg02614.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/il-antlr-interest@googlegroups.com/msg02614.html</A>



Suggested Solution 1: local new/delete allocation/deallocation
------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------
So my rule will now look like this:

myrule
scope {MyStruct* s;} //scoped POINTER
@init{ $myrule::s = new MyStruct();} //explicit allocation using new
@after{ delete $myrule::s; } //explicit deallocation using delete
:<i> rulegoeshere....;
</I>
Looks good? Well, I think not!
Because when the rule fails, the @after action is NOT called, and I'm gonna
get a nice memory leak.

Solution 1': the scoped wrapper has a member called free that can hold a
'deleter', but I couldn't find a way to set that.


Suggested Solution2: override antlr macros ANTLR3_MALLOC and ANTLR3_FREE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice try, but ANTLR3_MALLOC is currently defined like this:
#define    ANTLR3_MALLOC(request)                    malloc
((size_t)(request))

As you can see, the 'request' argument is a SIZE, not a type, which means
that if I want to override it to make it use 'new' instead of malloc, I
cannot use it.
&gt;<i>From the given size I cannot deduce the type (this could work the other way
</I>around if you change the define, to pass it the type you could get the size,
and it could be possible to override the default way of antlr's
allocations/deallocations)



That is my problem and those are the options I have. Maybe with some
adjustment some of them will work, but right now, I'm not happy with any of
them: first one leaks, second one is not usable.

Maybe you have some hints for me :-)

Thanks a lot for your answer

   Chris

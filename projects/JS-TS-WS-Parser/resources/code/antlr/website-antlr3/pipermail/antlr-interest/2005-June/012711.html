<PRE>Hi Jean,

&gt;&gt;<i>For what feature do you want a undo/redo aside from editing text ? Depending on the feature, I can add that in a future release.
</I>
In a word &quot;everything&quot;

I am in the throws of completing the code of an enhanced undo manager (a drop in replacement for the standard Java one)
This manager holds a main trunk of undos (a linear progression from start to where you are now ordered by time) and branches for 'every' other trial that got backtracked out of.

For grammar creation I would see each code generation as a step (save a copy of the whole grammar file at that point, or a diff if you wish)
Then when an approach to a set of rules does not work you can easly back out, but without ever loosing the option of going some or all of  the way back down that branch at a later time.


Just select the node in the tree and press enter to recover to that point (either incrementally or by jumping to that point).
Have a simple demo to show off the tree.
Three things left to do 
i) sort out rollback of the tree if a server update fails in client server mode where operations are stacked waiting for the server (optional)
ii) add extended descriptions (optional)
iii) and then a brief article.

Let me know if you think this would be of use
all the best
matthew

P.S
I would also like to see undo's for all non-trivial operations ,such as save when it overwrites an existing file

P.P.S.
I don' believe in having a File Save option.  If I have taken the effort do some edit I expect the default operation of the program will be save my endevours (with the option ofcouse to undo the save if I change my mind)   I have implemented this in my Parallel program (a Java interface for GAUSS)  <A HREF="http://www.forward.com.au/products/parallel/index.html">http://www.forward.com.au/products/parallel/index.html</A>
 You only need to have a SaveAs function which allows you to save under another name (again keeping a copy of any overwritten file for undo).  If you close the application you work should just be quietly saved and re-opened (if the file still exists) next time.  A missing file on open just gives a discrete message and allows you to continue.   Note the error messages always say 'Continue'  not OK.  Errors are never OK,  but good programs can recover from them (even OutOfMemory) and continue to provide service as best they can.

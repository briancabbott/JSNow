I do agree that graph-rewriting seems more useful, but only if the 
graph-rewriting language has enough &quot;power&quot;.

But, I believe I mis-stated the SableCC technique. They generate a set 
of classes that represent the AST, _and_ they generate a &quot;visitor&quot; 
abstract class. The &quot;visitor&quot; is the basic implementation of the visitor 
pattern. Basically, each pass subclasses the visitor abstract class and 
overrides the appropriate methods.

I am doing something similar to SableCC, but instead of operating on 
grammars I am operating on Abstract Syntax Graphs in the form of MOF 
models (MOF is a subset of UML used to model the static-semantics/ 
abstract-syntax of modeling and programming languages). That is, I 
generate a visitor from the abstract syntax's UML diagram, and I call 
this visitor while walking the composition associations in the diagram.

 &gt; But then what do you do about multiple passes?  What you end up doing
 &gt; is having a bunch of parallel subclasses representing each pass.  The
 &gt; beauty of a tree grammar is that you abstract away the AST into the
 &gt; rules and get to reason about it at the scale of the grammar and rules
 &gt; instead of a bunch of different classes.

&gt;<i> By the way folks, there is an interesting project at www.brics.dk/metafront.

This does seem very interesting. Thanks for the pointer.

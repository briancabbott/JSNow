Maybe. TDAR isn't very verbose on this topic and only mentions hidden
channels for whitespaces. From my reading I understood that parsers can
only read from exactly one channel (TDAR, p. 25). However, for my purposes
I would need only the non-comment channel in some cases and both channels
in other cases. Is there any documenation on how to do this with channels?

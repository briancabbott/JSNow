Hi Prashant.  I like it. :)  A very interesting twist.  How general  
would it have to be I wonder to be useful.  For example, could it be  
just the method names to use?  Probably not.  I think that if we  
could agree on the available arguments to functions such as the child  
index etc... we could let the user specify templates.  This is one  
nice thing about using StringTemplate for code gen.

Loring and Monty and I discussed something like this for tokens and  
ASTs at the Oregon ANTLR cabal.  But we thought in terms of what  
properties you could have.  Perhaps we should go further and specify  
the templates used to do common operations.  For example, here's one  
kind of tree access using ST notation:

getChild(node,index) ::= &quot;node.getChild(index)&quot;

and here's another:

getChild(node,index) ::= &quot;node.children[index]&quot;

Interesting.  In this way there would be no penalty going through a  
tree adapter for example to access the other tree.

Hmm...I also like no casting...I'm getting mighty tired of casting  
when using data structures I can tell ya!

Great line of thinking!  Can anybody think of problems?

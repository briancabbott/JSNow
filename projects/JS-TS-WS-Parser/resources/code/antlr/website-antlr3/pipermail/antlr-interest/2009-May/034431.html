<PRE>Hi Jim,

 

Thank you very much for your reply. I tried with the .tree solution you
suggested, but got errors like &quot;error C2440: 'type cast' :  cannot
convert from 'p_return' to 'pANTLR3_COMMON_TOKEN'.&quot; I can see that you
are trying to use the common token structure, but the way to get the
common token of current node doesn't seem to work. 

 

Is there anything I did wrong? Do you have any idea why it's not
working? Thanks again.

Linlin

Sorry, I didn't give a subject to my last question. Below is the
details, can anybody help me out?

 

I presume that you mean:

p: r1 r2

In which case you need to use one of:
$tree
$p.tree
$p
$r1.tree
$r2.tree

But I can't tell you which from the code you show, but you should be
able to work that out. Also, don't forget the search on the ANTLR home
page, or the Wiki

Jim

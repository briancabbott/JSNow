<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm honestly surprised that there's a cost here.  When ideas were being
</I>&gt;<i> collected, there was no mention of that detail when asking for feedback,
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions, etc.  Now to find out that it is a for-profit venture is

</I>
&gt;<i>From now on anyone who posts a question on the mailing list is
</I>required to explicitly mention whether the replies to it would be used
in a commercial product or not.
Only the free ones will be answered and if you got a for-profit
venture behind it then you will be required to pay for the answers.
All ideas, feedbacks, suggestions will be given to free projects only.
For - profit ventures are illegal and banned from anything related to
ANTLR.

</I>&gt;<i>  No, I'm not annoyed/offended/etc.  Free software or commercial - whatever.
</I>&gt;<i> As I said, I'm just very surprised at the history and the support.  Not a
</I>&gt;<i> slap in the face, certainly, but puzzling.

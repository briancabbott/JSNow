Yep - I know all about that stuff, believe me ;-). However when walking
an AST other representations can still be useful.

&gt;<i> (and that includes nullary and unary

</I>&gt;<i> strictly binary form is _not_ the most useful one for the kind of 
</I>&gt;<i> processing that I have to do.
</I>

However, more importantly, so that markmail has an answer for the
future, did that construct give you what you needed? ;-)

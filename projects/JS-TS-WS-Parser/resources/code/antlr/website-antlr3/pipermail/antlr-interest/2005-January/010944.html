    RAII. Resource Allocation is Initialization. Modern C++ relies
    heavily on the use of destructors to restore state when the
    stack is unwound. The question as to whether it is general, I'm
    not sure I understand. If you're wondering whether it is a
    generally accepted practice in C++, the answer is yes.

&gt;<i> 	In practice, &quot;finally&quot; code generally only needs to reset a
</I>&gt;<i> 	small number of things, so it's not as bad as you might think.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Would ANTLR need to analyze C++ actions (shudder) in order to construct the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bool_flag(arglist) thing?  Probably.
</I>
    No. It simply falls out of proper C++ use.

    int foo()
    {
        std::vector&lt;int&gt; nums(10);      // Create a vector of nums
                                        // possibly allocating heap
                                        // memory.

        do_something_that_might_throw(nums); 

        // ~std::vector&lt;int&gt;() frees the memory no matter what.
    }


&gt;<i> 	In ANTLR for C++, you don't need &quot;finally&quot; at all because if
</I>&gt;<i> 	the user wants the functionality, s/he can simply do what I
</I>&gt;<i> 	did, i.e., create a variable having a destructor.
</I>
    And a decent C++ type is built around RAII and a destrcutor that
    does the right thing.

&gt;<i> 	The only reason I want &quot;finally&quot; in ANTLR is because I'm using
</I>&gt;<i> 	Java (only because I'm paid to) and Java needs &quot;finally&quot;.
</I>
&gt;<i> 	But this implies that ANTLR for Java and ANTLR for C++ would be
</I>&gt;<i> 	different.
</I>
    You could still have that finally block for C++, no problem, but
    C++ programmers wouldn't find much use for it. Finally exists in
    C++, but the state of the art is such that it is not the best form.

    Finally strikes me as a universal concept in any langauge that
    has exceptions, Python, C++, Perl 5/6, Java, C# all have it.
    
    A C target is a challenge.

<PRE>Hi,

I am new to the parsers and ANTLR but I wish to pose a question 
concering directed (with directed edges) tree parsing.

My program produces trees where each node of a tree can assume 
nominal values from a finite set i.e. X={a,b,c,d}, Y={A,D,E,F}. I 
would like to know how from an adjacency matrix (matrix where there 
is 1 in row X and collumn Y only if there is a directed edge from X 
to Y i.e. X-&gt;Y) representation and knowledge about the values that 
each of the variables can assume I could generate lexer and parser. 
The structure of the tree is unknown in advance (i.e. depth) but it 
can restrict those trees to binary trees, but I ideally I would 
prefer not to do so.

In addition to this information I have a probability distribution of 
these variables P(X=a,Y=e).

How could I generate such a tree recognizer?

In addition I am wondering how I could easily generate FSM(Finite 
State Machine) using ANTLR. Are there any tools for FSM generation

Thanks for assistance,
Walter

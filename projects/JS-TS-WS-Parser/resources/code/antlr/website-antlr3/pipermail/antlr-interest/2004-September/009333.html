Great! Is this based on the included spec file ? If not I'd appreciate
patches to the included spec file.

Did you base this on java or on gcj ? How did you solve the problem with
java on linux (e.g. the lack of a standard place where it's installed? Or
did this improve lately?)

&gt;<i> Building the rpm I found a minor problem with antlr-2.7.4.tar.gz. when

Yeah that one slipped through :( I can provide a 'service pack' patch on
2.7.4 that fixes a load of issues found after release.

&gt;<i> I also have some questions for Terence Parr.

</I>
Well I'm not Terence but anyway ;) GPL (at least I assume you mean GPL) is
quite different from public domain. Which is the current license for antlr.
So better stick public domain in the RPM header (at least I assume you talk
about the license tag for the RPM header?).

Redistribution should be ok it's public domain after all, only if it's
somehow modified then you should better mark it as such in a readme or the
RPM header. You can also upload the RPM's to antlr.org. Or put a link on
antlr.org to your site (that's what I do with my antlr snapshots, that's
more convenient than hassling with the upload file thing)

Actually it could be cool if Terence made a yum repository for antlr on
antlr.org (it's only a certain directory structure on a ftp/webserver) That
way we could automatically push out updates.

I didn't use libtool because it doesn't add anything when building a static
archive. It only adds delays in the build (ok not a big issue anymore since
I got my new machine ;) )

Cheers,

Ric

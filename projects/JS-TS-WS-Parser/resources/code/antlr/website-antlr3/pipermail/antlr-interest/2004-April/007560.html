<PRE>That is sort of what I thought.  Lexer-&gt;Parser-&gt;(AST?)-&gt;TreeWalker

So when using the parser without any tree syntax that would still produce 
a AST correct?  If so, why have the manual intervention of the Tree 
syntax?  I believe I am confused on the seperation of the parser and 
trees.

Thanks John.

Ron

&gt;<i> If I wanted to make a parse tree for a language so I can transform it

Do you want strictly a &quot;parse tree&quot; or do you want an abstract syntax 
tree?
I.e., do you want a tree which strictly and precisely encodes the source 
or
do you want something more abstract?


&gt;<i> I am slightly confused about when to use the different types of grammars
</I>&gt;<i> (token or tree).  At first I was under the impression you make the token
</I>&gt;<i> grammar then convert to the tree.  If that is correct why would you do
</I>&gt;<i> that?  If it is wrong what is the normal way to do it.  I looked at some
</I>&gt;<i> examples and they seem to either be completly seperate or a mixture of
</I>&gt;<i> both whichs leads me to my middle ground of not understanding.
</I>
Think of the following as a pipeline...

You write a lexer grammar so that Antlr will generate a lexer to consume
individual characters from the source file and output tokens.

You write a parser grammar so that Antlr will generate a (token) parser to
consume the tokens from the lexer and then output an &quot;abstract syntax
tree&quot; (AST).

You write zero or more tree grammars so that Antlr will generate a tree
walker/transformer to consume an AST and output an AST.

You write a tree grammar so that Antlr will generate a tree walker to
consume the final AST and output whatever your final output needs to be.

Have fun,
                 John

<PRE>Then why were you discussing one as opposed to ten hours :-)

That program I eliminated i/os from was a classic practical example. By
the time I'd made my guesstimate, we only had two weeks left to finish
the project and get the results in the customer's hands. In other words,
if I hadn't optimised then we'd have been sunk if either the first run
failed, or I'd underguesstimated.

(Sunk quite literally - this app was predicting weather at sea :-)

Cheers,
Wol

</I>&gt;<i> Do you really *need* to do that strictly in the parser?  Why not just
</I>suck
&gt;<i> down a simpler language in the parser -- which recognizes any number
</I>of
&gt;<i> stars followed by a # -- and then do a more refined semantic check in
</I>a
&gt;<i> later stage.  That would make for a much cleaner solution.

John, it seems we again have a communication problem. It is just an 
example to illustrate something. I do not have a practical problem like 
this. This is a *theoretical* discussion. I am talking *theory* all the 
time :)

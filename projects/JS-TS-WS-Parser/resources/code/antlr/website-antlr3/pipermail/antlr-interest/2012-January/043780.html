<PRE>Hi Gavin,

I may be missing something (I often do) but as best I can tell, we're
concerned with identity v. non-identity only, and not history, of trees.
So I don't understand how a version number is safer than a flag.  Sure, a
flag can be erroneously flipped back, but as version number can be
erroneously set to anything.  I'm not sure either is more likely than the
other.  But I completely agree that a version number works at least as well
as a flag.  Both reduce the comparison from O(n) to O(1).  And if a version
number is safer, great!

Meanwhile, I'm really having a hard time coming up with any elegant answer
to the challenge in Part 1 of Ter's original post.  I'm not yet resigned to
a &quot;conservation of ugliness&quot; principle (in the grammar v. in the listener)
but I admit I don't have anything better at the moment.  You guys who live
in the belly of antlr will know better than me.

These should be available via $FIRST or $FIRST(rulename) and $FOLLOW or
$FOLLOW(rulename). They give the names of the bitsets internally used for
the match/consume/consumeUntil/etc methods. Should be documented in 2.7.2
release notes and runtime.html.

I don't know of any examples. If you grab a copy of the public cocktail
toolbox and check for the docs on the LL(1) parser (ell.ps) it contains a
description of how ell does error recovery and how the sets are calculated.
It might take some hacking to completely implement it since the 'repair'
mode from ell is not present in antlr. Atm I have no clue wether it could be
emulated or not. If you have trouble finding the doc from ell drop me a
line I still have a copy lying about.

Cheers,

Ric

  &quot;I think we better split up.&quot;
  &quot;Good idea. We can do more damage that way.&quot;

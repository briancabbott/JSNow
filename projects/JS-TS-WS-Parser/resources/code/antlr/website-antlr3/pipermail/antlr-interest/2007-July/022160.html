I've tested the attached patched grammar (in case I didn't change it
correctly), but with the same results. I'm using ANTLRworks 1.0.2 and
ANTLR 3.0, so I don't know what could be wrong on my machine.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> success, but not with the Java version, as I don't have parser for that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've tested Java.g with the same result as with the attached grammar.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But using the debug option caused it to be truncated. My non-attached
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grammar was also truncated, but resulted in a different parse:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;               -&gt; MismatchedTokenException
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  root -&gt; action -&gt; actionScopeName -&gt; parser
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                 -&gt; MismatchedTokenException&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Looking at this I'm not sure if the culprit is the syntactic predicate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code, as you suggested.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, not sure I'm following you here. You mean parsing Java.g from
</I>&gt;<i> the ANTLR distribution with your ANTLR3ToRelaxNG grammar resulted in
</I>&gt;<i> the same error as parsing BackslashBugTest below?
</I>
Correct.

&gt;<i> And to test that you
</I>&gt;<i> used ANTLRWorks debug option which had to truncate the input?
</I>
Correct again.

Best regards,
Johannes Luber

I think they have a forwarding account subscribed or something
similar. It should be listed on their site I guess.

&gt;<i> 2) If I post to that <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">antlr-interest at yahoogroups.com</A>, will it arive
</I>&gt;<i> into gmane ?
</I>
Yes. Unless you add some specific headers to your message. See the faq
on gmane.org.

&gt;<i> You all seem to post to some &lt;&lt;antlr-interest-hHKSG33TihhbjbujkaE4pw
</I>&gt;<i> at public dot gmane dot org&gt;&gt;, but this address is not mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere ( on antlr site ). Or does yahoo .forward those messages
</I>&gt;<i> to gmane ?? Please can you tell me ?
</I>
Some may do that some may not. Gmane uses some obfuscation for email
addresses. The yahoogroups address is the official one. The gmane one
also works I guess.

&gt;<i> 4) but you need to spider yahoo ( I don't know currently hope I'm
</I>&gt;<i> wrong ).
</I>&gt;<i> But gmane seem to have lot less messages then yahoo.
</I>&gt;<i> You seem to switch somewhen at Jun-2004 ??
</I>
Gmane was enabled much later than the yahoogroups thing was started.
You can't spider yahoogroups very well they got some protection
against it (is my impression I tried).

&gt;<i> 5) like to know, what are you going to do switch at now ?
</I>&gt;<i>    to that groups-beta.google.com
</I>&gt;<i> I don't say google is bad ( didn't try it ), I just like to know.
</I>
I think Ter set up a mailinglist on antlr.org. Yai! So now we can now
also UTFS ;)

Cheers,

Ric

<PRE>Hi Bill,

I think you're doing something weird here:

ShellLexer l = new ShellLexer(input);

You are reusing the CharStream that your parser is using.  I don't know
if this is really supposed to work or not.  Try this instead:

ShellLexer l = new ShellLexer(new ANTLRStringStream($SHELL.getText()))

This copies the characters into a new buffer with no ambiguous impacts
on your top-level parser.  I use this exact pattern to parse strings in
my language. 

One other thing you might consider is not parsing the shell command at
all.  If all you intend to do is run the command you can simply split
the command on whitespace then use java.lang.ProcessBuilder.  Here's
what I mean:

String[] cmd = $SHELL.getText().split(&quot;\\s+&quot;);
ProcessBuilder bld = new ProcessBuilder(cmd);
Process p = bld.start();

In order to make this trick work you want to stuff all of the shell
characters into a single token.  Here's how you could do that:

SHELL: 'shell' ~('\n' | '\r')+ ('\r')? '\n' ;

This token definition is like the ones you would use to implement a
mechanism similar to a '#define'.  The token blindly snarfs everything
after 'shell' until the end of line.  This is good because the
non-syntax elements won't bother your parser and because it preserves
whitespace which you will use later to tokenize your shell command. 

Hope this helps!

Cheers
./m

</I>&gt;<i> lines I modified.  Then, I can give the massaged input to Antlr.  The

</I>&gt;<i> line, and return a list of them, in order.  I can just put the shell
</I>&gt;<i> Command instances back in the list where they belong and be on my

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I said though, it would be really cool if I could just do this all

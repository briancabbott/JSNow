</I>&gt;<i> enhancements they'd like to contribute, drop me a line or better
</I>&gt;<i> still post it to the list.

&gt;<i> Micheal
</I>
I made one extension to define TokenTypes as a C# enum rather than a class
with public const int members.  Pretty minor, but it did make it easier to
produce output displaying what tokens had been parsed in a stream and so on.
I'd be happy to send what I did if you like, though there isn't a whole lot
to it.

&gt;<i> Is C# ready do you think to be included in the main release?
</I>
Don't mean to speak for Michael, but I would like to say that I've been
using the C# codegen intensively and have found it to be excellent.
Certainly release-worthy in my opinion.

Two posts in a row, enough from me!

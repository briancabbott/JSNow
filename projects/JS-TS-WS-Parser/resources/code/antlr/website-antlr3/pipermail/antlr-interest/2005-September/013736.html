<PRE>Some people will probably now email me saying its not in the 'spirit'
of ANTLR which is free to make an IDE which is commercial.

Well yes, even i think that it is wrong that i have to pay for my
computer,cell phone, table , chair , bed, etc. I think all those
people are evil bastards who dont work their ass off day and night to
provide me free stuff.

If you want to enjoy the freedom and the spirit of free software you
can try the other plugins for antlr that exist(no offence meant to
their developers whatsoever), but if you want a kick ass IDE that will
make write grammars easy and almost trivial use ANTLR Studio :)

And stop comparing to ANTLR Works. Thats for antlr 3 which wont be out
for another year.

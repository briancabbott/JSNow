</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Ah, great, looks like we were on the same page as far as the inteface
</I>&gt;<i>between GUI and lexer\parser goes, you just sent specs in terms of Java
</I>&gt;<i>interface rather than the net based protocol. And I certainly wasn't
</I>&gt;<i>think of some nasty CORBA style thing, just a text protocol like you
</I>&gt;<i>suggest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Just thought I'd mention that I really like CORBA, and I think the days 
of everyone inventing
their own little text-based protocol across a socket are over. However, 
in this case, it
may be overkill, as the complexity of the data is very low.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As to the format of the interface, I meant the standard Java style
</I>&gt;<i>listeners, extend java.util.EventListener (just a tag for tools) and
</I>&gt;<i>then (add|remove)Listener(...); methods (hadn't remembered that Java's
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;Listener&quot; pattern was quite so simple, too long living day to day in
</I>&gt;<i>C#'s delegate land I guess).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Amd then events of the form:
</I>&gt;<i>void location(LocationEvent evt); 
</I>&gt;<i>where LocationEvent extends java.util.EventObject.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'd certainly recommend using Listeners (I assume that's what Terrence 
had in mind).
But I wouldn't extend any of the built-in Java Events, as you don't need 
any of
that functionality.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>While I agree about the general issue of cost\benefit, these changes
</I>&gt;<i>seem of little cost, seem to offer some functional benefit (the two
</I>&gt;<i>use-cases of modular handling in the GUI and code-gen specific events)
</I>&gt;<i>and also fit the standard Java design patterns thus making them easier
</I>&gt;<i>to understand for those familiar with other Java apps (in this case a
</I>&gt;<i>rather weak point due to the simplicity of the pattern but still) and
</I>&gt;<i>understandable by other language tools.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Also, extending built-in Java Events will make handling them in other 
languages a mess.

Andy

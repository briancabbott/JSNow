Hi Bill,

Yep.  I did to pick features to start with so that there IS no char  
copying by default, which is why the ! is such a huge pain this go  
around.  All tokens point into the char buffer, the correct  
approach.  It's very rare to modify more than a few tokens' text.  I  
believe I've made the right choice here.  For your comment case,  
you'll get love out of the box; no ! needed.  I call that a great  
invisible feature :)

Thanks to all for the comments!

Ter

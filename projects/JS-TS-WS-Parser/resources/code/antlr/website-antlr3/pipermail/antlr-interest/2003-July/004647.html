<PRE>Which is why I drew a CAREFUL distinction between SYNTAX and SEMANTICS.

In other words, at the point at which I downloaded antlr, I would have
understood perfectly what you were asking. It's just that in my case,
most of the questions would not have been capable of being answered.
Just because the question makes sense doesn't mean that the questionee
can provide a sensible answer... like asking a colourblind person
whether they prefer red or green ...

Cheers,
Wol

I don't understand.
You're saying you can't understand these questions???
Which question don't you understand?
My whole goal with these questions was to make them
understandable by any programmer.
Heck, even most non-programmers would understand most of them!

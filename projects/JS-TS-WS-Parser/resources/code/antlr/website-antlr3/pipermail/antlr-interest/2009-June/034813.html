<PRE>ANTLRWORKS accepts tab in input box without any problem. The version I'm

Subject: [antlr-interest] Bug in AntlrWorks debugger


Hi,

Is this the right place to post AntlrWorks bugs? I looked around but didn't
find any other place.

It seems that AntlrWorks does not accept Tab characters (or backslashes, for
that matter) in the Text field of the Input Text dialog box when you press
the Debug button. 

The result was that the grammar was compiled, and prepared, but when it came
to connecting to the debugger it timed out. Removing the Tab character from
the input allowed the debugger to connect.

Originally, I thought for sure it was something to do with Windows Firewall,
or my
Java configuration, so I reinstalled Java and reset the Firewall
exception for java.exe and javaw.exe. No change. It's definitely the Tab
character in the input text.

I thought this was very strange, so I tried to use \t instead of a Tab
character, however this also caused the debugger connection to time out. I
also tried \\t and \\\\t, just in case it was some sort of escaping issue,
but none of these worked either. Only when I remove Tabs and Backslashes
does the debugger connect, and then debugging works fine.

I'm using Windows, and I wonder if this might have something to do with it.
But still it seems strange. How is the input text transmitted to the
debugger? Via command-line? That seems to me the only way a Tab or Backslash
could interfere with connecting to the debugger.

Anyone else notice this?

Rob

Dropping in a bit... So if I understand correctly you want to ignore or
just store the contents of the method { .. } block?

Basically you need to do tokenstream multiplexing to do this. Basically you
have one outer lexer that recognizes the bits you want to deal with then
when you encounter the &quot;method {&quot; bit you switch to another (inner) lexer
that only counts braces (and maybe keeps track of comments). That lexer you
can use to just throw away the contents or to store it elsewhere. When the
inner lexer sees the last brace it tells the multiplexer object to switch
back to the outer lexer which continues where the inner lexer finished.

Something you don't want to try ever is to steer this process from the
parser (saw a remark about something like that somewhere in the thread)
this will always fail in the general case.

Have a look at the multiLexer example to see how this is done. Also check
the archive from the list for tokenstream multiplexing and the docs on it.

You will most likely fail if you try to do this from the parser side
(unless you implement the language inside the method as well).

HTH,

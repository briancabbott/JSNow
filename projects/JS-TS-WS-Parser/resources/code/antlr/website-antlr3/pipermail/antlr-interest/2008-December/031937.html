It's still well supported on OS X (i.e. Apple); I tried to get GnuStep  
to behave itself but eventually gave up because it would do all sorts  
of weird stuff to me. That said, the fact a language hasn't been  
updated for a long time doesn't always indicate it's dead (Cobol is  
still there and in frightening places; a supplier bank claimed their  
code was all in Java now but I pointed out their documentation which  
was clearly lifted straight from a COBOL program itself).

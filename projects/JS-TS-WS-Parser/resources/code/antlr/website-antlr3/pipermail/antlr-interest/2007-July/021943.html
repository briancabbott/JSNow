&gt;<i> Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ANTLRWorks debug parsers listen on a socket to connect to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ANTLRWorks debugger. As your main parser is already using this socket
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the sub-parser cannot also use it. If your inner parser is different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to your outer parser then you could use a non-debug version of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inner parser. Or if they are the same, you could, while debugging
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; create a second copy of your parser with a new name and generate this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without debugging enabled and then use that for your inner parser, or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just generate to a different package and use a fully qualified name
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for it.
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm.. This seems to a sort of solution. Tedious but okay .
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Alternately there is a constructor that takes a port to debug on, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if you used this constructor with a different port then they should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not clash. However then your inner parser will wait for socket
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connections from ANTLRWorks to start parsing, maybe you could have two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; copies of ANTLRWorks open (if it allows this) and connect the second
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; copy to the inner parser, though you would have to connect ANTLRWorks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; after the constructor for you inner parser was called so if the inner
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parser is constructed as needed then you would have to re-connect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ANTLRWorks everytime one was started. So unless you reuse a single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parser instance this is somewhat tricky.
</I>&gt;<i> I did new nameParser(token,port no) and made another copy of antlrworks
</I>&gt;<i> work on the port but it did not work :(. It was waiting for ever for
</I>&gt;<i> the connection.
</I>I would think this should work, if you can have two copies of
ANTLRWorks open. I didn't mention it but you have to do a Debug remote
after the construction of your new parser. And if your not using a
shared instance of your parser then do so again after each
instantiation. And, if you are using a shared copy I'm not sure if
ANTLRWorks will properly handle the resetting of the parser.
&gt;<i> &gt; There is a constructor for DebugParser which accepts a debug listener
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but ANTLRWorks does not add an override for this constructor to it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; debug parsers, if you added an override for this constructor then you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could have your inner parser not wait for ANTLRWorks by providing an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; alternate debug listener. You can add this constructor to your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; @members section but then you need to remove it when not compiling
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with debugging.
</I>&gt;<i> I added the required constructor and  called it with
</I>&gt;<i> new nameParser( token,getDebugListener () ) . This also did not work :(
</I>Yes, I don't think ANTLRWorks would like multiple parsers connected to
one debug listener. I was more suggesting you use nameParser(token,
new BlankDebugListener()) or you could use one of the other listeners
(see org.antlr.runtime.debug classes) to at least have tracing on the
inner parsers.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I requested that ANTLRWorks template be changed to also override this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; constructor. In the meantime it would be a fairly trivial patch to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ANTLRWorks templates to allow this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also another point is that i could have variable no of recursive calls
</I>&gt;<i> to the parser . So these
</I>&gt;<i> solutions may not work well.A good feature in the ide will be to make
</I>&gt;<i> both inner and outer parsers work on the same instance of the debugger
</I>&gt;<i> ie let debugger make connections to any no of parsers. I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> how hard or easy this is it but I do understand that this can be very
</I>&gt;<i> difficult .
</I>I imagine this would be rather difficult to support and not a big
priority given this isn't exactly a common usage.
&gt;<i> Another good feature would be to add a method setDebug(bool) to the DebugParser
</I>&gt;<i> class.
</I>Passing BlankDebugListener to the (added) constructor should give this
functionality.
&gt;<i> Currently i am working without the antlrworks IDE when i make
</I>&gt;<i> recursive calls to the same parser.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Tom.

<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Is this possible with TML without much lasting damage to 
</I>&gt;<i> one's already 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dwindling follicular reserves?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was thinking of that and had started converting to TML earlier...
</I>
Are you saying that it is possible (and relatively painless to tranform TML
to &lt;other-tag-language&gt;)?. Do you have any such tools ready built?

&gt;<i> For the &quot;real&quot; doc (i.e., the ANTLR v3 book) I was going to use latex.
</I>
What's the advantage (if any) over XML?. I haven't used TeX in any
significantly angry manner since I discovered Word/PageMaker  ;-)

&gt;<i> &gt; Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Micheal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PS    Kunle did reproduce the CSharp Runtime doc manually just to  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Confluence has to offer. He reports much pain (as is 
</I>&gt;<i> typically of such 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manual tasks) but, results are very pleasing to the eyes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hooray!  I wonder if emacs and some rexpr could help.
</I>
Perhaps but, it's all come to nought anyway. 

With the admin passwd reset issue and  the inevitable(??) loss of all
existing content, noone will ever get to see it and, I doubt he'll be
willing to repeat a manual conversion. 

Fun and games. Oh, the joys...

Cheers,

Micheal

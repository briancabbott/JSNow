<PRE>Hi,

There's variable names coming from some parts of the 'base'
codegenerator. If these do not need additionial processing then I'll
probably will not touch them (so '_' may creep in there). In the
support code itself you will probably never see '_' at the start of a
variable since I dislike it.

&gt;<i> Why is _ttype better than ttype, tokenType, token_type, or whatever one

</I>
Whichever works ;) as long as it's used structurally across the
library. I like consistency.

&gt;<i> P.S. is ANTLR3 C++ target complete?
</I>
I was catching up before I bought my house, but the C++ target never
left prototype stage. At the moment work will probably restart end of
januari after I've done most of the decorating moving. I can give no
timeframe since work interferes a lot as well.

Cheers,

Ric

Have fun doing that yourself.  :-( :-)

Really, that's just plain nuts.


&gt;<i> Output parsers written in C or Python.

++


&gt;<i> Print trees in an easy to look at form.
</I>
What do you mean by that?

You might check out Ter's pstree or whatever he called it which created
fairly nice tree diagrams in Postscript.


&gt;<i> Is is necessary for the user to see as much java as he now has to?
</I>
What do you mean by that?


[...]

&gt;<i> A grammar is a highly terse description of a highly recursive stucture
</I>&gt;<i> with little internal documentation and with bits of java in it like
</I>&gt;<i> prions in a brain. Are there better ways to write down a grammar?
</I>
Basically, it comes down to... What tradeoffs matter to you?


[...]

&gt;<i> Non-interactive debugger. Ideally, there would be an interactive debugger
</I>&gt;<i> where you see the tokens as they are fed to the parser and also see the
</I>&gt;<i> changes that are made in tha AST.
</I>
Yeah, I'm hoping that Antlr3 will make hooking in various kinds of code
generation and run-time instrumentation much cleaner.

Take care,

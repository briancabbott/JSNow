2.7.2a2 should have it.. Maybe a small bugfix here and there not sure.

In that case the user would have to supply a good copy constructor that
does the right thing. The dupXXX's in C++ just call the clone method of a
AST and that one generally uses a copy constructor.

&gt;<i> 2. the nodes have bidirectional links - i.e. parent&lt;-&gt;child and
</I>&gt;<i> sibling1&lt;-&gt;sibling2..&lt;-&gt;..siblingN - that will effectively turn every

Hmmm standard antlr has no back links. And probably the dup algorithms
can't handle those properly. And I don't know what the use is of dupping to
a level higher than the node you are starting the duplicate with. Generally
when you dup a bit I'd suspect you're only interested in the subtree.

Anyway on a different line of thought the dup methods IMHO don't belong in
the factory anyway. No part of antlr's generated code uses them as well
(AFAIK). It's a bunch of convenience functions. The combination of 2.7.0/1,
dupXXX and heterogeneous ASTs was even pretty much broken anyway (C++ maybe
even other codegen).

&gt;<i> It's a worry that the use of these methods will incur a severe
</I>&gt;<i> memory/space cost essentially. A deep clone would always deep copy
</I>&gt;<i> all such linked objects too.
</I>
That's one of the risks of duplicating stuff. Then again ANTLR generated
code doesn't use the dup methods. And it's probably not a good idea to
invest a lot of time in making them 100% idiot proof, they should be
AST/BaseAST/CommonAST proof (well at least that's my view of them), then
again it's not my time ;)

Cheers,

Ric

I'm pretty new at using parser generators in general and antlr in particular, 
and you may want to listen if someone more experienced responds.  But for 
what it's worth, I recommend buying the new &quot;Definitive ANTLR reference&quot; 
book, which I have been reading the past week.  

ANTLR is a complex enough tool that it takes time to learn to use it well.  
It's pretty clear that the book has saved me a lot of time by teaching the 
essential theory and practical information much more quickly than I could 
figure it out from the online docs, trial and error, etc.

Your question is a good example: it's not really a short answer question, but 
the book is good at relatively quickly helping you decide what the best 
approach is and how to go about implementing the solution.

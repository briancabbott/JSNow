I'll add a few thoughts here.  I can remember wondering if the unlabeled 
reference to a token from an AST action was a good idea.  Can't remember 
if John Lilley or I came up with the &quot;shortcut&quot; of not requiring a 
label, but I definitely remember being nervous about the decision; 
naturally, the decisions in the early days of Java-based ANTLR were done 
in extreme haste given my time.

I turned off code generation on unlabeled token references since they 
couldn't be used in an action...well, that is until Ric reminds of the 
dreaded IDENT reference from AST code.  FYI, I *rarely* do this.  I 
always use a reference since it's explicit.  Probably why I didn't run 
into this.  OTOH, didn't I do the AST stuff for the Java grammar? ;) 
oops.

&gt;<i> So the options are:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) No optimization and generate 'sloppy' code until a later release.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Label the IDENT and use the label in cases like this.
</I>&gt;<i> 3) always generate declarations for things like IDENT (not for things 
</I>&gt;<i> like
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;class&quot; since you can't reference it in actions (can't?) )
</I>
This is a shortcut that will work and a decent compiler will remove the 
code for creating the value if it can determine the ctor is side-effect 
free.  Yeah, right. ;)

Since the AST action is special, it's best to track which tokens are 
referenced and update the &quot;generate AST node&quot; boolean for that grammar 
item.  These actions have to be translated anyway, so a simple check 
inside the action recognizer should fix this.  Oh wait, actually, forget 
that.  You'd have to do 2 passes over the rule looking for backward 
references.  Ick.

Option 3 is good for now and optimization folks can simply rewrite to 
not use the rule level ! and use individual ! on the grammar elements.

 &gt;You really looked at the grammar in depth! I agree that it looks 

 &gt;silly, but the point of the 'addressable' is that you can start
 &gt;with a variable or argument, and use methods and attributes of
 &gt;this variable or argument to chain them together (e.g.
 &gt;myarg.SomeGetMethod().AnotherMethod().GetAttribute()) so yes, an
 &gt;Identifier by itself is a valid addressable.

I think you may have missed my point.  You've said that an 
&quot;addressable&quot; by itself is a valid statement.  Obviously a method 
call is a valid statement.  But is an object or field reference a 
valid statement?

To give examples (not all of these may actually be valid in your 
language, I'm just speculating on the language structure):
   &quot;myarg.SomeGetMethod().AnotherMethod().GetAttribute()&quot;: method 
call, definitely a statement.
   &quot;myarg.somefield.AnotherMethod()&quot;: also a method call, through 
a field this time, but still clearly a statement.
   &quot;myarg.SomeMethod().somefield&quot;: method call but then a field 
reference.  This is a value, which may be a good expression but is 
it really a statement?
   &quot;myarg()&quot;: method call; probably a good statement, although it 
depends if your language allows global functions or method 
pointers (like C/C++) or if you have to call through an instance 
object (like Java/C#)
   &quot;myarg&quot;: variable reference, a value; again it's obviously an 
expression but is it really a statement?

C/C++ permit expressions to be statements in their own right, but 
C# (and I think Java too) don't.  From the looks of your grammar 
it sounded like you didn't want expressions to be statements 
normally, with the single exception of the final one in the 
function (acting as a return value).  (Although having said that, 
it does raise the question of why you want to break consistency 
just to permit leaving out one keyword ;))

(Of course, I also strongly dislike single-exit-point languages; 
they can lead to excessive nesting and temporary variable 
shenanigans, especially when simply trying to assert 
preconditions.  But hey, whatever makes you happy.) :)

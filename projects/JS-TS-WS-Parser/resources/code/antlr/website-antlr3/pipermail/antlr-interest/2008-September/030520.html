<PRE>Hello everyone,

 

In the stg files in the org\antlr\codegen\templates\your_language folder
there are two functions where NoViableAltExceptions are generated:
dfaState and sfaStateSwitch. Both of these have an edges attribute,
which contain the if/switch statements that precede the
NoViableAltException. What I want to do (see also the &quot;How to get a list
of all valid options for the next token?&quot; discussion) is to get a list
of the numbers in those statements.

My approach of including &lt;edges&gt; in @&quot; &quot; (C#'s syntax for a string
literal) and applying a regular expression to it works for simple cases,
but if two of these sections are nested C# chokes on the nested quotes.
So I need to preprocess the edges variable somehow.

&gt;<i>From what I've been able to find it's not possible to use programming
</I>code inside a stringtemplate, so something like
edges.toString().replace(...) is impossible (if it is possible I'd love
to hear how). So that leaves me with using the properties and such that
stringtemplate allows. To do this I need to know what type it is though.


According to the code in ACyclicDFACodeGenerator.java in
org\antlr\codegen its type should be StringTemplate, because of

dfaST.setAttribute(&quot;edges&quot;, edgeST);

and

StringTemplate edgeST = templates.getInstanceOf(dfaEdgeName);

 

However, if I put for instance &lt;edges.version&gt; in the stg file and try
to compile my grammar file with AntlrWorks I get an error that
STAttributeList doesn't have that property. Ok, apparently edges is an
STAttributeList (though how that follows from a StringTemplate is still
a mystery to me), which inherits from ArrayList, so I can access the
elements in edges with something like &lt;edges:{e|&lt;e&gt;}&gt;. But then what
type are the elements in edge?

 

So can anyone tell me the type of the elements in edges (or how to use a
replace/regex function on attributes in stg files)?

 

Thanks in advance.

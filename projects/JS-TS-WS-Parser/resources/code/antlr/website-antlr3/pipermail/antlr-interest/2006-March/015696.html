</I>
Of course, if your code is not generated, it can be broken. But I'm saying
about base classes that are fully defined by AST structure.
For example, depth-first walker that calls user methods in each node, can be 
generated automatically. User methods can require manual update.

The main problem is to find out when user code is broken.
For example, if you write your visitor as an inheritor of generated empty visitor,
after creation of new node type empty visitor will be re-generated. And you
will not have any messages telling that your visitor probably should be updated
to process new node type!

It is one of the main disadvantages of tree processing in general purpose programming
language (I'm thinking about Java, but the problem exists in other languages, may be not in all).
So, we need tool support to make additional checking, specific for our domain,
for our data structures. I contend that a set of tree node types allowed in AST
should be considered as specific data type with specific operations.
For example, when you are making switch by node type: switch(ast.getType())
you implicitly suppose that node type belongs to right AST structure,
because node type is unique only within AST structure.
So, we can talk about operations on AST that must be defined for eash node type in AST structure.
Or about partial operations on AST that must be defined for some node type
and all its inheritors in AST structure.
But in general-purpose programming language we have no support for such data types
and can't check that operation is defined correctly (on each required node type).
Simple domain-specific language (for example, TreeDL) solves the problem.

Alexey

32 bits would be enough to support all Unicode code points but is that
adequate?  You may want to work with grapheme clusters which consist
of one or more code points.  Loosely, a grapheme cluster is what the
end user might call a character.  'e' and combining acute are two code
points but one grapheme cluster.  That particular combination can be
normalized to a single code point but many cannot.

Issues with code points above the BMP are similar to those with
combining characters.

I've been looking at how Java (JDK 1.5), C# and ICU deal with
encodings.  They all use strings of 16 bit characters (UTF-16) as the
prime units to operate on.  Single characters are available in 32
bits (UTF-32).  Grapheme clusters are available as UTF-16 strings;
the length of those is generally one, but two for surrogate pairs
and two or more where combining characters are involved.

A question to ask is what is best for ANTLR.  It is not a word
processor or text renderer.  The lexer is converting characters into
tokens.  These tokens tend to be either punctuation, whitespace,
comments, keywords, or literals.  The last three are fairly opaque.
We need to be able to some sort of isKeyword test on the last two
but aside from that their contents should be of little interest to
the lexer.

My preference would be to stick with UTF-16 strings in ANTLR for
compatibility with current languages and libraries.  Leave it up to
the grammar writers to deal with &gt;16 bit issues where they arise.

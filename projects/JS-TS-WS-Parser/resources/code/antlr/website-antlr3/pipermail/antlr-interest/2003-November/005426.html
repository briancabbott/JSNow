Ah--perl is a useful tool, but it can warp the mind.  Good ANTLR 
development practice is that

Lexers are for separating input into tokens; while parsing can be 
done in the lexer, it is usually not good practice.

Parsers are for recognizing token sequences and tree construction.

Tree rewrites are for reorganizing token sequences into a regular 
form suitable for output.  The final treewalk passes are for output.

For a &quot;simple&quot; translation of the sort you describe (no complex 
optimization passes), you should be able to avoid complex action 
code.  It's all a matter of restructuring ...

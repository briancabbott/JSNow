Please read the API documentation for the C target, where all the
@sections are explained in detail. You can add your own members to the
lexer or parser context pointer that is supplied to every rule.

This should be in the API documentation under the &quot;Using sections in
grammar files&quot;, however it seems that something in the annotation is
making it stop after the @postinclude section. I notice that there are
other pieces that I have documented that are not there too. I hope I
have not lost something here as it was quite a bit of effort! :-( 

Anyway, what you want is:

@parser::context
{
  struct _mystruct * mystruct;
}

There is also 
@lexer::context
{
    int myLexerThang;
}

There is also a (void * userp) available in the shared state for each
instance of the recognizer (which is free threading). In lexer tokens
there are 3 integer fields you can use and one void * field you can use;
in lexer grammars you can access them via the pre-defined MACROS: USER1
USER2 USER3 CUSTOM (see API docs for the other macros).

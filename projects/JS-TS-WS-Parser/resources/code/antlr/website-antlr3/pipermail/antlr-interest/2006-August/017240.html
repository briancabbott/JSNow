<PRE>Kay--

&gt;<i>From what I've seen, Martin tends to complain about design missteps, and most of his complaints are accurate.  The complaint here is that numbered channels are non-intuitive and it would be better to support symbolic names.  I have to agree--and Ter probably will too when he thinks about it.  One solution would be to add a lexer option, &quot;channels&quot;, which takes a string with comma-separated names or some such.  ( channels = &quot;HIDDEN, COMMENTS&quot;; )  Or have a &quot;channels&quot; section in the lexer.
</I>
Often the issue with interface design is not &quot;this is bad&quot; but rather &quot;this is not as good as it could be&quot;.  That is the case here.  Channels look to be a useful abstraction, but support for symbolic names would be convenient.

mmmh. I think regexp syntax is used because it is widely known. It is  
a concise way of describing things, yes, but I still maintain that it  
is not hard to learn.

The basic syntax of matching things is not really difficult. Ok, the  
concepts of predicates need a bit intuition, but still I find them  
consistent and their symbols pretty easy to remember.

My question then is, what in particular do you guys find irritating?  
(Maybe I do you wrong, Martin, and you don't find it confusing, but  
the question remains ;))

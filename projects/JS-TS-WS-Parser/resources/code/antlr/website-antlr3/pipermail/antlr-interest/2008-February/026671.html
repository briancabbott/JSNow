Now I believe I know what's your problem actually is. You are getting 
exceptions in the lexer, but you aren't catching them because the catch 
clause doesn't include the lexer. That would make sense as the lexing is 
done separately from the parsing. There only one problem with the 
theory: FillBuffer() is called by NextToken() is called by the parser. 
So the exception should be on the call chain. Strange. Nonetheless test 
it, because changing the generate code is always a bad idea, if there is 
an other way.

And to your other question in the other email: ANTLR has a special 
syntax for exceptions in its grammar, but that doesn't work yet.

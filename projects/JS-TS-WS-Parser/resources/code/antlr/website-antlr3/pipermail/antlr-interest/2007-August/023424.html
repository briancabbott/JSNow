<PRE>In the examples there is a file examples/C/main.c which contains 
this code:

   input       = antlr3AsciiFileStreamNew(fName);

   // The input will be created successfully, providing that
   // there is enough memory and the file exists etc


That is utterly nonsense.

When I get something and cast this something to &quot;unsigned&quot;, how 
can this new value (which is unsigned by the cast!) now ever be 
smaller than zero?

BTW, GCC 4.1.2 emits this as warning

Second: the return value for antlr3AsciiFileStreamNew() is a 
pointer. Comparing this for &lt; 0 is nonsense again, because the 
c-runtime could as well give you back 0xD00C0020 as address for 
this pointer. This, seen as a signed value, would be smaller 
than zero. Yet the object has been successfully created.



So the whole interface idea isn't sane.  You can't really, in a 
platform independend way, encode return values into 
pointer-returning functions.

Suggestion:

All the xxxxxNew()-Functions that normally return a pointer 
should return NULL as error condition. You could have an 
antlr3errorid variable somewhere, where higher levels could 
refer to to find out why the xxxxxNew()-Function failed.

If you don't like a global variable, then change the calling of 
the xxxxxNew() functions to something like this:

    pANTLS_POINTER xxxxNew(ANTLR3_INT32 *errCode);

so the end-user can specify where to store the error condition 
code.

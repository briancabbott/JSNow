Howdy, Andreas,

I hope I'm not completely misunderstanding the point of your project, 
but I'd say you should DEFINITELY hide the classfile details from the 
user.  The .class file format is obnoxious.  You can't even execute 
it in place without doing a lot of preprocessing!  Ugh!

If your project isn't too proprietary, can you publish your class 
file parser?  Ter's been wanting one to throw around for years.

Good luck,
JSRS

Well, more that the first grammar has 2 lexer rules and the second  
has three: one for each char.

&gt;<i> As I tried to say earlier, although the rules language used for the  
</I>&gt;<i> lexer and parser seems to be describing things in the same manner,  
</I>&gt;<i> they in fact describe very different state machines. So at the  
</I>&gt;<i> least this is an inconsistency which leads to confusion.
</I>
It is in the interaction between the parser and lexer.  When you move  
rules wholesale into the parser from the lexer, shouldn't things be  
&quot;different&quot;?  This is NOT a scannerless parser.

&gt;&gt;<i> From every book I have ever read on language parsing, using the above
</I>&gt;<i> grammar, 'ab' does not match KEYWORD but unambigously matches only  
</I>&gt;<i> OTHER OTHER.
</I>
Well, the (...)* decision in program will match ab as oTHER only if  
not followed by c.

&gt;<i> This is dealt with by the parser state machine (using kEYWORD and  
</I>&gt;<i> oTHER instead of KEYWORD and OTHER) as oTHER oTHER and not as a  
</I>&gt;<i> missed kEYWORD. So the lexer is producing state machines that  
</I>&gt;<i> interpret the same gammar rules in totaly different ways from  
</I>&gt;<i> common usage and the parser's usage.
</I>
Nope.  Move it to the lexer and DFA predicting (...)* is identical to  
that in the parser.

grammar lex;
KEYWORD : 'a' 'b' 'c';
OTHER : 'a' | 'b' | 'c';
Program : (  KEYWORD |  OTHER  )* ;

Trust me.  The same algorithm and code generator are used for both.   
One parsers tokens, the other char.

&gt;<i> As you say, this is correct because you say it is correct but it is  
</I>&gt;<i> confusing, unconventional and hard. I can decide to speak my own  
</I>&gt;<i> language and use the same words others do but give them different  
</I>&gt;<i> meanings. I can even change their meaning from sentence to sentence  
</I>&gt;<i> and consider all of this as correct if I am the corrector. But  
</I>&gt;<i> that's streaching it.
</I>
Why are you picking on such a little example?  Try a real grammar or  
is this a condensation of a real grammar you're trying?

&gt;<i> Its just that I need to figure out what other ramifications this  
</I>&gt;<i> has and if it was at all possible to have the lexer and the parser  
</I>&gt;<i> give the same meaning to their grammar rules, it would make it  
</I>&gt;<i> easier to think consistently and use.
</I>
They are identical...you are shuffling things between parser and  
lexer and saying it's not the same.  Of course not.

As a CA shrink would say, &quot;just let go of LEX&quot; ;)

<PRE>Hi Steven,

&gt;<i> Micheal;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have tried every release available for download on the ANTLR 
</I>site (related to
&gt;<i> c#) before we sent out the original message.
</I>
Very odd. The 'calc' example is a tested example, but you are saying 
it doesn't work on 2.7.2a2 and 2.7.2a4?. I should mention that the 
NAnt build files aren't always reliable. Can you build the &quot;antlr.net-
2.7.2a4.sln&quot; solution?. It includes the most tested example - &quot;java&quot;

&gt;<i> What we did find is that 2.7.2a4 builds fine with nant but not VS. 
</I>so there may
&gt;<i> be some issues lurking in the various baselines.
</I>
OK. Now I know that your experiences are exceptional and very odd 
indeed. Both ANTLR/C# versions 2.7.2a2 and 2.7.2a4 are tested with 
VS.NET and Nant on .NET v1.0 Steven. We have built ANTLR/C# using the 
actual files on the website. 

I would suggest looking again at your VS.NET installation/environment 
but, I don't really know what you should be looking out for. Have you 
tried deleting the bin and obj sub-directories under the lib/csharp 
directory and doing a full rebuild again.

&gt;<i> Unless someone else can see an obvious problem we will attempt to 
</I>dig into the
&gt;<i> issue using a different methodology but I wanted to cover as many 
</I>of the simple
&gt;<i> errors as possible before doing that.
</I>
Well, I've put down a to-do to re-check and update the NAnt files for 
the supported examples for the 2.7.2a6 release too.

Micheal

PS    What kind of projects do you use ANTLR for?

PPS   What system produced the output messages included with your 
previous posting?. I thought it looked interesting at the time but 
forgot to ask in my reply  ;-)

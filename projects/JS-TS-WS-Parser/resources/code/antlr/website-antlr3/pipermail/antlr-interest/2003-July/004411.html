One of the main techniques computer scientists use
for reducing the &quot;burden of complexity&quot; (the babel of
languages) is to divide problems up into logical
parts.  In the case of language translation or
compilation they employ this &quot;divide and conquer&quot; 
pattern by translating first into an &quot;intermediate
representation&quot; and then once again to the chip's
language (or &quot;virtual machine&quot;).  ASTs are a family
of intermediate &quot;tree languages&quot; that are used for
this purpose.  They vaguely resemble lisp, a
language with &quot;Lots of Silly Parentheses&quot; which 
make it friendly to the machine, less friendly 
to human readers.

If you are interested to the tune of $15, Amazon
has a deal for you:  Terrence Parr's out-of-print
book &quot;Language Translation Using PCCTS &amp; C++&quot; is
there used (3 copies).  For $60 new, I recommend
&quot;Modern Compiler Implementation in [C|Java|ML]&quot; by 
Andrew Appel.  Three books, same material in each.

Mr. Parr's current doc on antlr (which was PCCTS) is 
freely distributed with the antlr package.  Or read 
his course materials from a recent university course 
at

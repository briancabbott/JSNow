<PRE>Hi,
I am a new to ANTLR and have been trying to detect if the parsing was
successful or not. As of now, I was using the @after block, which gets
executed
only if the parsing was successful. But this block gets executed, even for
incorrect inputs in the language. I think I am missing something, which I
must do
to deactivate the error recovery mechanism, to avoid the after block from
being executed. Can anyone please guide me to some material on this issue.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks

<PRE>Hi,
 
You mentioned using gUnit and the C target. Isn't gUnit a Java-target-only
grammar test tool?

George,

I have no embedded actions other than a few counters to resolve ambiguities.
I use the C code to produce an AST which I then process using C++ classes.
The C runtime is very quick to lex and parse into an AST.  I convert the
ANTLR generated AST into a C++ AST class and extract information from it
using class methods.  It works very well.

The advantage of this flow is that I can use gUnit to validate my grammar
and AST.  I HIGHLY recommend using gUnit (or equivalent) as it will find
errors that otherwise would go unnoticed until you are in the middle of some
critical demo/project.  gUnit will also help you produce efficient AST
structures as you will 'see' the tree produced from each rule as part of
setting up gUnit.  As you make changes to your grammar or the AST rewrite
rules gUnit will validate that you still produce the expected tree structure
- which is critical since your C++ AST class data extraction methods expect
a certain fixed structure and must be sync'ed to the actual AST produced.

Regards,

Brent Yates

Thanks Brent, that worked great!

 

Are you using pure C or C++?  I'm using C++ classes embedded in my grammar
due to the nature of the information I want to extract.  I haven't gotten
this to work yet so I'm just seeing if you have tried and what worked, what
did not, etc.

 

Thanks again,

 

George

George,

I am using the Antlr3.1b1 release with the C runtime (Windows XP) and it
works just fine so the problem is probably in your classpath / launch
procedure.  I use a batch file to compile my grammars.  Here is an example
that works for me:

@echo off
set
CLASSPATH=E:\UtilityDev\VerilogParser\AntlrWorks\antlr-3.1b1\lib\antlr-2.7.7
.jar;E:\UtilityDev\VerilogParser\AntlrWorks\antlr-3.1b1\lib\antlr-3.1b1.jar;
E:\UtilityDev\VerilogParser\AntlrWorks\antlr-3.1b1\lib\antlr-runtime-3.1b1.j
ar;E:\UtilityDev\VerilogParser\AntlrWorks\antlr-3.1b1\lib\gunit-1.0.2.jar;E:
\UtilityDev\VerilogParser\AntlrWorks\antlr-3.1b1\lib\stringtemplate-3.1.jar
set cmd=java -Xmx750M org.antlr.Tool SystemVerilog.g
echo %cmd%
rem %cmd%
%cmd% 2&gt;error.txt


My classpath environment variable is set in the batch file to point to each
of the necessary JAR files.

Hope this helps!

Regards,

Brent Yates

I think you could just define dupTree to invoke your adapter.

</I>
To properly handle insertion of missing tokens, I had to change the  
interface of match and so on. I was hoping that most people were not  
overriding the basic functionality. doh! I can help you update things  
on your side. Just let me know how I can help, such as answering these  
questions :)

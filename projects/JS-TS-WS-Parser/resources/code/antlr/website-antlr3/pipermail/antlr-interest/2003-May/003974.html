<PRE>
I had a problem similar to lgcraymer's while implementing my 
languaje, but I did not found any already-made AST class suitable for 
my needs: I needed a lookup table most of the time, but I'm modeling 
simple inheritance and polymorphism, so I could not use it for 
managing methods. This is, hashtables are not enought for modelling 
something like this:

class A {...}

class B
{
   method m(A a) // what to insert in the hashTable? &quot;m(A)&quot;?
   { ... }
}

class C extends A {...}

main()
{
    create B b;
    create C c;
    b.m(c); // could not find &quot;m(C)&quot;
}

So what I have done is abstract a little more and have a &quot;Scope&quot; 
class. A Scope can deal correctly with simple names and method calls, 
once the inheritance structure is present.

This classes, and many others (like an AST with lexical information, 
or utilities for parsing the command line) are structured in a 
package that I called antlraux. I'll release it when it is ready.

Cya,

Enrique

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Subject: [antlr-interest] Re: High level semantic analysis
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ANTLR's approach to the general problem is syntax tree
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transformation (possibly multiple passes) followed by an &quot;output&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pass which might generate an internal form that might not be tree 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; structured or might produce code.  Ter is working towards 
</I>an &quot;output 
&gt;<i> &gt; template&quot; approach for this final pass--details are still being 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; worked out.  I think that their &quot;rule based semantic analysis&quot; 
</I>could 
&gt;<i> &gt; be effected through one or more transformation passes, one or 
</I>more 
&gt;<i> &gt; linking passes (tree walks which build links connecting AST 
</I>nodes), 
&gt;<i> &gt; and a resolution pass to &quot;decorate the tree&quot; (attribute grammar 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; terminology).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any built-in support for the &quot;linking&quot; and &quot;decorating&quot; 
</I>you talk
&gt;<i> about.  Being relatively inexperienced in this aspect, I found this 
</I>to be
&gt;<i> one of the more confusing parts.  It was easy for me to see how the 
</I>lexer,
&gt;<i> the parser and even the tree walker worked (and why they existed).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR was great for getting to the point where all the information 
</I>was
&gt;<i> nicely arranged in a tree.  What I struggle with is &quot;Now what?&quot;.  
</I>For
&gt;<i> example, one of the first passes I could imagine doing on my AST 
</I>would be
&gt;<i> type/name lookup.  Once I've done that, I'd like to keep that 
</I>information
&gt;<i> around.  I'm assuming that is what you mean by linking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let me give you a quick example.  A simple Modelica package might 
</I>look like
&gt;<i> this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> package Ford
</I>&gt;<i>   package Types
</I>&gt;<i>     type Torque = Real(quantity=&quot;Torque&quot;, units=&quot;N.m&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i>     type Pressure = Real(quantity=&quot;Pressure&quot;, units=&quot;N/m^2&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i>   end Types;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   model Test1
</I>&gt;<i>     Ford.Types.Torque tau;
</I>&gt;<i>     Types.Pressure P;
</I>&gt;<i>   end Test1;
</I>&gt;<i> end Ford;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In order to elaborate the model Test1, I need to find the 
</I>information
&gt;<i> associated with the variables &quot;tau&quot; and &quot;P&quot;.  Note that while the 
</I>definition
&gt;<i> of &quot;Torque&quot; and &quot;Pressure&quot; are in the same place (Ford.Types.*), I 
</I>can
&gt;<i> reference them in different ways (Ford.Types.Torque vs. 
</I>Types.Torque) but
&gt;<i> the semantics are the same in either case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, I have an AST node for my declaration that probably looks 
</I>something like
&gt;<i> this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> #(DECL #(TYPENAME &quot;Ford&quot; &quot;Types&quot; &quot;Torque&quot;) #(COMPONENT &quot;tau&quot;))
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Somewhere else in my AST I have something like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> #(PACKAGE &quot;Ford&quot; ... #(PACKAGE &quot;Types&quot; #(TYPE &quot;Torque&quot; ...) #(TYPE
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Pressure&quot;)))
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I'd like to be able to do is walk the tree and find every 
</I>TYPENAME and
&gt;<i> then somehow link, as you say, that #(TYPENAME ...) node back to 
</I>the #(TYPE
&gt;<i> &quot;Torque&quot;) node.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BUT, what I don't want is this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> #(DECL #(TYPENAME &quot;Ford&quot; &quot;Types&quot; &quot;Torque&quot; #(TYPE &quot;Torque&quot; ...)) #
</I>(COMPONENT
&gt;<i> &quot;tau&quot;))
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> right?  This would change my tree grammar.  I want links, but I 
</I>don't want
&gt;<i> ANTLR to pay attention to those links for the purposes of tree 
</I>walking.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does this sound right or is my mental model of all this wrong?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Assuming I am right (which is a big assumption), I didn't see 
</I>anything in
&gt;<i> ANTLR that supports these kinds of associations.  Am I missing 
</I>something?  I
&gt;<i> know I can define my own AST node types and I could add some data 
</I>structures
&gt;<i> to support linking but there were two reasons I didn't do this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) I figured if this is what I'm supposed to do then everybody 
</I>would have to
&gt;<i> do it and ANTLR would support it somehow.  The fact that I didn't 
</I>see this
&gt;<i> functionality in ANTLR led me to think perhaps I wasn't going about 
</I>this the
&gt;<i> correct way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) I was quite concerned about how all this linking and associating 
</I>would
&gt;<i> impact the garbage collection system for AST nodes.  To be honest, 
</I>I find
&gt;<i> the whole process of defining a new AST type pretty complicated.  
</I>There seem
&gt;<i> to be so many different AST types and I never know when to use one 
</I>or the
&gt;<i> other (e.g when do I use my AST type and when do I use RefAST, etc).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now I'm not really blaming ANTLR for either of these issues.  I'm 
</I>just
&gt;<i> saying that for me this was somewhat intimidating and so I was 
</I>hesitant to
&gt;<i> get all tangled up in implementing these details.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These are just some things to consider in the development of ANTLR 
</I>3 that
&gt;<i> might make the tool easier and more approachable to people like me.

Howdy,

Just met with Etienne Gagnon, the SableCC guy, in Montreal and gave an 
ANTLR lecture.  Etienne is a smart guy and seems to have the same goal 
as I do in general: building good parsing / translation tools for 
commercial programmers.  His further goals are language independence 
and hiding the complexities of LR-based parsing from the grammar 
developer.  I believe SableCC is currently LALR(1), but he has finished 
creating a method that will get him closer to LR(1).  He has the start 
of a visual debugger (for eclipse) that seems nice.  For language 
independence, SableCC does not allow actions in the grammar.  As for 
tree construction, he builds trees that are &quot;type safe&quot;; that is, they 
conform to a particular structure specified in a &quot;tree grammar&quot; 
section.  ANTLR takes the opposite approach which is: you have to parse 
trees multiple times during translation so let the tree walker check 
the structure (&quot;type safety&quot; in his terminology) as it must traverse it 
anyway.  Further, the structure changes so the original tree grammar 
(&quot;type structure&quot;) is no longer valid after creation.

He is going to try to implement linear approximate lookahead for 
SableCC.  I showed him some tricks :)

He loved the dynamically-scoped attributes thing, by the way. :)

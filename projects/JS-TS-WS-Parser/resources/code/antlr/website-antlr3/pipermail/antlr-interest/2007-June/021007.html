<PRE>Hi,
 
Doesn't directly answer your questions but, why not try the C target for
V3?. You could always wrap the C runtime API up in C++ classes anyway. There
was some discussion about UNICODE and the C target a while back on the list.
All you need to do might be to supply an input stream of wchar characters (I
could be wrong on this so search the list archives).

Subject: [antlr-interest] Unicode support in both v2.7 and v3



 Hi,

 

I am trying to use ANTLR to generate a query parser in C++. Since C++ is not
supported yet by v3, I am trying v2.7.6 right now.  I would like to know how
the Unicode is supported in both v2.7 and v3.  Does it support the input
stream which is a wchar_t*? Which UTF encoding formats does it support
(UTF8, UTF16, UTF32)? From the Reference Manual for v2, it seems that
Unicode is not fully supported yet and claims that v3 will have a better
Unicode support. Is Unicode fully supported in v3?

 

I am new to ANTLR. Sorry if those questions have been answered before.

 

Thanks,

 

Yiqing Yang

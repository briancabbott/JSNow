<PRE>
&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Subclassing uponEOF() to somehow persuade nextToken() to fudge 
</I>and 
&gt;<i> &gt; return one final NEWLINE token seems to be the &quot;wrong&quot; approach. 
</I>Will 
&gt;<i> &gt; it work?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You might get something going with an extra tokenstreamfilter to do 
</I>your
&gt;<i> extra token fudging... Another option might be subclassing the 
</I>lexer and
&gt;<i> overriding uponEOF and nextToken (the latter only proxy original 
</I>nextToken
&gt;<i> untill the special case arrives)
</I>
Thanks. I was thinking along those lines but I guess it just felt 
wrong somehow.

&gt;<i> Notice that uponEOF might be called more than once, not 100% sure 
</I>if this
&gt;<i> is related to me having tracing enabled by default, it might also 
</I>be a
&gt;<i> result of guessing mode.
</I>
I wasn't expecting that...

&gt;<i> The trouble with this will probably be to make it play nice when 
</I>the parser
&gt;<i> is in guessing mode.
</I>
...all this is herding me in the &quot;sort it all out in a hand-crafted 
TokenStreamFilter&quot; direction.

&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Perhaps ANTLR should support a &quot;virtual EOF char&quot; that can be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; matched like any other char in Lexer rules in addition to the 
</I>current 
&gt;<i> &gt; [upon]EOF end-of-file condition mechanism?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd go for that one anytime, uponEOF is very awkward in use. It 
</I>also allows
&gt;<i> to make nicer errormessages for unexpected EOF's, uponEOF is (at 
</I>least in my
&gt;<i> attempts to make use of it) useless.
</I>
Well then, I'll consider it added to the cookie jar for ANTLR v3 ;-)

&gt;<i> &gt; Related Question:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -----------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there a standard inbuilt mechanism for stuffing arbitary Token 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into the Lexer's output TokenStream?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> TokenStream filters would be closest to that. I think you might be 
</I>able to
&gt;<i> find something in the archives related to stuffing extra tokens 
</I>into the
&gt;<i> stream, I recall seeing stuff in the past.
</I>
Cool. Thanks, I might think about on-demand code-gen for this. Sort 
of like:
$insertToken(new CustomToken(...))/$appendToken(...)

The codegen would then generate code that uses a Vector/ArrayList in 
nextToken() as appropriate. 

Oh forget it...it's trivial to write. I'll just check that it's 
covered in the FAQ  ;-)

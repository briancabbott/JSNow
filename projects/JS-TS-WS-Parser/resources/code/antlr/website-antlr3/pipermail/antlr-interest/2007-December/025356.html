That's where I hit my limits of understanding. What error recovery can
be done at the bottom of a rule anyway?

&gt;<i>  As an option, and the default for pre 3.1, you can have antlr try to

That's really bad.

&gt;&gt;<i> nextToken() catches RuleMismatchException (could be another kindof
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exception), so it doesn't declare that it throws RuleMismatchException.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But there are instances, where someone wants overwrite nextToken() with

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm...well, I just looked and it seems like it will cause a ripple

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Throwing a recognition exception from a token stream is undefined. Who

</I>&gt;<i> exception for the parser.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Does that make sense?
</I>
It makes sense from your point of view. But does this mean, you would
solve the problem described in the XQuery report under 7.7.2 via a
run-time-exception?

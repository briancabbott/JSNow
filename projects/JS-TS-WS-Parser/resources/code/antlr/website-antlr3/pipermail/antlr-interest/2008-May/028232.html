hooray!

&gt;<i> Things are coming along quite well; as of today the target passes

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I write this message because I wanted to get a couple legal and

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) 99% of the JavaScript target code is original (although heavily  
</I>&gt;<i> inspired, of course, by the other targets).  The remaining 1%  
</I>&gt;<i> consists of a modified version of the Yahoo class provided by the  
</I>&gt;<i> Yahoo UI Library.  This code is licensed under the BSD license like  
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR, so I assume this won't cause any problems.  If this is an  
</I>&gt;<i> issue I could rewrite the code, but it would be a hassle.  Here's a  
</I>&gt;<i> link to the YUI license:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.html</A>

seems ok. so you would simply be including a source code file with a  
license a the top? Should be fine.

&gt;<i> 2) It appears that the 3.1 release is imminent.  My work has been  
</I>&gt;<i> based off the 3.01 release to date.  Do y'all think it would be  
</I>&gt;<i> valuable to create a finished 3.0.1 compatible version of the  
</I>&gt;<i> JavaScript target, or should I port what I have now to 3.1 and  
</I>&gt;<i> release that?
</I>
We could include 3.0.1 JavaScript target with 3.1 as long as the  
templates worked and the runtime was consistent.

&gt;<i> I'll send out the documentation and code in about another month.  It  
</I>&gt;<i> should be complete and pretty robust at that time.
</I>
Oh okay, it seems like you will miss the 3.1 deadline; uh, like this  
weekend ;)

</I>
Heh,bring on the beer, dude. ok, wine, but same idea... what part of  
the city do you live in? If you hear gunshots, that's probably my  
neighborhood too. [might one take this discussion to an offlist thread]

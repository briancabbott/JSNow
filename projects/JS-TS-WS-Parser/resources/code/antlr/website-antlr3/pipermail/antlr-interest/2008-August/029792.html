</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't break compatibility. That's what they have to do now, even if
</I>&gt;<i> 1) is true.
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Make sure that incompatible versions can be installed

</I>&gt;<i> 4) Ooops, that's a problem, I haven't thought about this yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What are your thoughts?
</I>
For C#, the GAC handles multiple versions of the runtime (however one 
does install assemblies in the GAC...). Breaking API changes aren't thus 
propagated to users of earlier versions - at least that's I've heard, 
.NET should work. Never used that feature myself before, so, more 
knowledgeable people, correct me if I'm wrong.

Otherwise, I do consider ANTLR not stable yet. There are too many 
missing features, too many possible changes to declare ANTLR done. How 
much the targets are affected, is another question. But at earliest 3.2 
will have the features and general maturity to be called by me as the 
real first version which fulfills the promises of Ter.

</I>&gt;<i> I work for Oracle and I'm researching transformations between SQL

</I>
I just finished a SQL grammar for use in a product that needs to 
translate into different SQL dialects.

&gt;<i> I was thinking about what things I would do in the passes.
</I>&gt;<i> I had the following choices
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Would each pass handle one SQL statement( one for the select
</I>&gt;<i> statement, one for the update statement ...)
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Would the first pass handle expressions, the second pass handles
</I>&gt;<i> all DML ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I recommend 2) because it keeps the  translation organized by concept.

&gt;<i> If I went the second way with the following simple example.
</I>&gt;<i> SELECT col1 + 2 FROM table1
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> my source AST would look like this
</I>&gt;<i> SELECT
</I>&gt;<i> |-SELECT_LIST
</I>&gt;<i> | |-+
</I>&gt;<i> |   |-col1
</I>&gt;<i> |   |-2
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |-FROM
</I>&gt;<i>   |-table1
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My first pass would change the expression
</I>&gt;<i> SELECT
</I>&gt;<i> |-SELECT_LIST
</I>&gt;<i> | |-TARGET_AST
</I>&gt;<i> |   |-col1
</I>&gt;<i> |   |-2
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |-FROM
</I>&gt;<i>   |-table1
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then I couldn't recognize the SELECT_LIST as it was half source AST
</I>&gt;<i> and half target AST
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Its easy enough for me to create the source AST grammar and the target
</I>&gt;<i> AST grammar.
</I>&gt;<i> I think what your saying is that I write a new AST grammar that can
</I>&gt;<i> recognize both.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> select: #(SELECT select_list from)
</I>&gt;<i> ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> select_list: #(SELECT_LIST
</I>&gt;<i>                  #((operator|TARGET_AST) // choice between source and
</I>&gt;<i> target AST's
</I>&gt;<i>                       column number)
</I>&gt;<i> ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You got it.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see what you mean but I was hoping too keep things as neat as 
</I>&gt;<i> possible.
</I>&gt;<i> If the source or target AST changed then I would have to update this
</I>&gt;<i> into my grandaddy of all grammars
</I>&gt;<i> I used to think super grammars could combine a source and target AST
</I>&gt;<i> for me but after reading a few of your own articles I realized thatH
</I>&gt;<i> this is not what they are for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yep.  I would consider noweb or writing your own simple preprocessor.  
The join points for your grammar will be very simple to author, a 
simple include mechanism would allow you to keep separate .g files for 
source &amp; target.

&gt;<i> Maybe I should just transform entire sub trees to the target and not
</I>&gt;<i> worry about having a sub tree which was a combination of both.
</I>&gt;<i> Im only working on a simple prototype at the moment but Im trying to
</I>&gt;<i> think of some of the big issues and approaches.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That forces you to translate it all in one pass.  No chance to handle 
expressions separate from DML.

I'm also available to discuss this by phone and/or consult if you would 
like some more intense conversations about this.

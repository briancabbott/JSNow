You will first have to understand the differences and convert in to a LL
ANTLR grammar.

 

I'm not sure but ABNF might allow left recursion. In that case you need to
remove left recursions from the grammar. There are standard methods to do
it. Here is the theory behind it :
<A HREF="http://www-und.ida.liu.se/~TDDA89/Notes/left.rec.pdf.">http://www-und.ida.liu.se/~TDDA89/Notes/left.rec.pdf.</A> And here is an article
from ANTLR wiki:
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Left-Recursion+Removal+-+Print+Edit">http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Left-Recursion+Removal+-+Print+Edit</A>
ion

 

Replacing backtracking by Left factoring can also be done very
methodologically. You just have to remove the necessity for infinite
lookahead. Refer
<A HREF="http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/research/mtech1998/9811115/node29.html">http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/research/mtech1998/9811115/node29.html</A> to
understand what left factoring is.

 

If you still have doubts, send us a small segment that you are not able to
left factor along with what you have tried.

Hi , 

 

Thanx a lot for ur reply. 

 

Sorry for asking the question on basic of ANTLR , could you pls tell me how
should I left factor my grammar. 

 

Currently I am working in SIP Protocol , where the RFC 3966 defines the TEL
URI Grammar in ABNF format. 

This format need to be converted into the parser understandable way. 

 

So I have used antlrworks for writing my grammar file.

 

And eventually end up with a complex state where I could not able to compile
the grammar without &quot;backtrack=true&quot;.

Yes, backtracking will affect performance. If you are concerned about
performance, don't use backtrack and try left factoring your grammar
instead.

Hi All , 

 

Pls let me know what are all the option that I could use , to get the
generated code with more performance. ( Need to be fast in parsing ). 

 

I have enabled &quot; backtracking = true &quot; , will this hits the performance ??? 

Without this option some ambiquity is coming. 

 

Pls help me in providing any better performace tuning option that I could
set for code generation. 

 

Thanx in advance

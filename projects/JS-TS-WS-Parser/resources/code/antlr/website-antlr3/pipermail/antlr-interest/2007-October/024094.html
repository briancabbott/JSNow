<PRE>All,

    I'm a relative newbie to parsing in general, and Antlr
specifically.  I'm a bit fan of test driven development, so I'd like
to write Unit tests.  I noticed that the front page has an article
about gUnit... While interesting, not exactly what I want for now.  I
haven't download it's source to see if and how they handled this.
Maybe that's what I should have done.

    My interest is in finding a way to have a grammar that has nice
error handling, but still be able to find an error.  I've done
something like the following to my grammer:

   private boolean recognitionFailed = false;

   public boolean getRecognitionFailed() {
        return recognitionFailed;
   }

   public void resetRecognitionFailed() {
        recognitionFailed = false;
   }

   protected void mismatch(IntStream input, int ttype, BitSet follow)
       throws RecognitionException
   {
      recognitionFailed = true;
      super.mismatch(input, ttype, follow);
   }


What I'm looking for is the easiest way to do something like this:

//  ... Setup a parser, and lexer to test input.
parser.declaration();
// Check to ensure that no error handling or recovery happened.  (It'd
also be nice to ensure that all of the input was consumed, but I think
that's doable).

For simple inputs that are attempting to parse C-like code with a
grammer like below:

program :
	declaration* ;


declaration
	: TYPE IDENTIFIER ';';
	
identifier : IDENTIFIER ;

TYPE
	: 'void'
	| 'int'
	| 'float'
	| 'double'
	| 'short'
	| 'long'
	| 'char'
	| 'signed'
	| 'unsigned'
	;

IDENTIFIER
	:  ('A'..'Z' | 'a'..'z' | '_')  ('A'..'Z' | 'a'..'z' | '_' | '0'..'9')* ;


WS
	: (
	  ' '
	| '\t'
	| '\n'
	| '\r' )+  {channel=99;};

If you pass in &quot;0bar&quot;, the lexer finds the 0, prints an error, and
then proceeds to generate token for &quot;bar&quot;, and then says that it is in
fact an &quot;IDENTIFIER&quot;.  This will get fixed once I train th lexer to
understand numbers, but it also exhibits my problem fairly quickly.

Any help on dealing with this would be much appreciated.  I figured it
should be trivial to use the parser like  a regular expression, and
call the equivalent of Java &quot;Regex.match()&quot;, but alas, that appears to
be more difficult then I think it should be.  I'm hoping I'm just
missing something blazingly obvious.

Thanks in advance,
      Kirby

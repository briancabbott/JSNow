<PRE>Summary: I'm rebuilding the E grammar in antlr 
(<A HREF="http://www.erights.org/e-impls/e-on-e/egrammar/">http://www.erights.org/e-impls/e-on-e/egrammar/</A>).  It contains a few 
occurrences of *recursively* nesting grammars, for which the current 
lexer switching is inadequate.  I finally figured out a different and 
simpler way to manage switching lexers that addresses this problem.

Context: E is an expression language, in which one of the expressions is 
a &quot;quasi-literal&quot;.  A quasi-literal is similar to (but more general 
than) a Perl string (or a Lisp quasi-list) in that it can contain 
$-escaped expressions in E.  Because these are arbitrary E expressions, 
they can recursively contain further quasi-literals.  A couple of examples:

    print(`The value of X is $x`)

    print(`Name: ${if (title.isEmpty()) { `${name}'s book` } else 
{title}} date: $date`

Backquote introduces a quasi-literal (and causes a switch to the 
quasi-lexer).  Within a quasi-literal, '$' escapes a nested expression 
(and switches to the E lexer).  If it is just an identifier, then no 
braces are required.  If it is a more complex expression, then braces 
are required.  Note, however, that since E also uses braces, simply 
encountering a brace is not the right reason to switch back to the quasi 
lexer from the E lexer (and thus the lexer by itself cannot manage the 
transitions back).  BTW The more general aspects of quasi-literals are 
outside the parsing realm, so I won't go into those, but they are really 
cool :-)

I initially implemented all this with multiple parsers and corresponding 
grammars, and blithely switched lexers in the parser productions.  This 
did not work at all because of lookahead and predicates:  lexer actions 
to switch the current lexer will happen during parser lookahead (whether 
it was triggered by a parser predicate or not), whereas parser actions 
by default do not.  Even if you make them happen in predicates, they 
still happen when the parser gets to the relevant token, which because 
of lookahead, is already after the wrong (unswitched) lexer has already 
consumed tokens past where you wanted to switch.  Thus, all lexer 
switching needs to happen purely within lexers.  There is not sufficient 
support to do that if the exit of the nested lexer must be driven by the 
grammar (and thus the parser) rather than by simple lexing.

After several rounds, it seems that implementing lexer switching as a 
TokenStream  (via TokenStreamSelector) is not the right place.  It is 
less accessible to the lexer or parser, cannot participate in the 
lookahead process, has less access to the line numbers, etc.  I instead 
merged that concept with the TokenBuffer, so a TokenMultiBuffer can 
select from different streams of tokens.  The class supports a stack of 
nesting lexers.  It also directly supports enter and exit (e.g., of 
braces) so that a nested grammar can be exited when encountering a 
close-&quot;brace&quot; that does not match an open brace in that grammar.  I had 
started support for participation in the parser predicates, but by then 
had figured that brace management was enough to keep all lexer switching 
under control of the lexers, so that semi-support is removed.

Even without the support for the parser changing the lexer, I found that 
using a special TokenBuffer to handle lexer changing was simpler than 
using a stream selector.  This is mainly because it adds no layers in 
the process of getting tokens, so debugging is easier.  Because it does 
not add per-token overhead, it could perfectly well be *always* wired 
into the framework.  Then, having multiple lexers would be special, but 
would not be an awkward integration.  In an informal sampling of 
languages, I believe that multiple-lexers will be increasing, and 
already would have been used more if it was more integral.  Thus, I'd 
like to see the token-buffer by default support it (fold the 
TokenMultiBuffer support into TokenBuffer), and make it so that adding a 
lexer will arrange for that lexer to have the shared input state 
(instead of having to arrange that explicitly).  This will also mean 
that lexers will by default be able to switch lexers, and you won't need 
to add language-specific code to do so (e.g., add a setSelector method, 
etc.).

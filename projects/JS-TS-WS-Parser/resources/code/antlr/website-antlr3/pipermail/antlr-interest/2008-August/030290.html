<PRE>Hello,

I'm new to ANTLR and I'm trying to get an a-few-hundred-lines-grammar 
working (fun! ;-). I've been chewing on a problem for quite a while now 
and was finally able to locate the cause but I don't understand it even 
after reading several online docs (haven't got the book yet).

It's probably very easy to explain for someone with a bit of 
experience... here's a short piece of grammar to reproduce the problem:

--- CUT ---
grammar DotProblem;

rule1: Foo ('.' | '!');

Foo: 'foo';
Identifier: 'a'..'z'+ ('.' 'a'..'z'+)*;
--- CUT ---

When running that in the debugger it matches &quot;foo!&quot; but not &quot;foo.&quot;, 
which causes a MismatchedTokenException.

Why doesn't it match &quot;foo.&quot;?

It has something to do with the Identifier token (which contains a dot) 
but I don't understand why.. note that to match as Identifier the dot 
would have to be followed by at least one letter, which isn't the case 
with &quot;foo.&quot;. Also the token Foo should have precedence over the token 
Identifier as it is defined earlier.

thanks, Max

</PRE>

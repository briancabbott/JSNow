<PRE>Hi,

Can anyone point me in the right direction of how I'd write a lexer/parser 
that handles quoted strings.  Ultimately what I'm doing would be used as a 
translator into SQL, but I'm interested in anything that deals with 
quoted strings.  

It would have rules such as this:

1. this that -- the words 'this' and 'that' would have to appear somewhere 
in the text.

2. &quot;a phrase&quot; -- word/words quoted would signify that the words would have 
to appear exactly in the text as typed in a keyword search.

3. &quot;some search terms&quot; qualifier -- same as above, and the word 
'qualifier' would also have to appear anywhere in the text.  In other words,
there's an implicit &quot;and&quot; between the quoted string and the word 'qualifier'.  
There could be a 0 or more qualifier words, as well as 0 or more quoted 
strings.

4. There could also be typos that have a starting double quote, with no 
ending double quote (ie &quot;not a phrase).  These would be treated as #1 
above, basically just stripping out the unbalanced quote.

Does anyone have or know of an example that I can use as a starting point?
I'm quiet a neophyte at using a lexer/parser so anything is useful.

Thanks a lot,
Tony

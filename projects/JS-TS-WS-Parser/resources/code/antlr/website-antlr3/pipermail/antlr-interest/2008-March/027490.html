<PRE>You will probably find it best to override pANTLR3_COMMON_TREE by encapsulating this within your own structure, as per the docs. This, as all the structures are, is a set of pointers to functions and you need only override the ones that you have to, just as in Java. Runtime type checking 'can' be an overhead, so i am not sure you would want to do that anyway, but I will contemplate your suggestion of course as it has some merit.

Oh yes, I know. I've already made a prototype implementation of a part of the grammar based on the idea I presented bellow (atom returns [OurNode* result] etc.). It is working but it is a little bit clumsy and I cannot use the resulting AST for a tree parsing - of course, I'm creating my own AST.

 

I've been thinking about the new tree adapter (I was talking about bellow) and probably you are true,  few C++ wrappers could do the work. But there is one inconvenience - there is not an &quot;abstract&quot; tree yet. The most abstract tree is ANTLR3_BASE_TREE_struct which contains children vector and other attributes. The ANTLR3_TREE_struct with only pointers to functions (something like a Java interface) would suit my needs better. Our existing AST nodes solve the storage already... Could you do it, please?

 

Another problem is safety. When somebody call ANTLR3_BASE_TREE_struct::addChild(pANTLR3_BASE_TREE tree) for example, I must trust him that the tree argument is really the tree he is calling. I cannot write dynamic_cast&lt;MyTreeWrapper&gt;(tree-&gt;super). This cannot be solved in the current C-based system.

ANTLR 3.1 C target can now incorporate C++ code directly into the grammar and so can easily call your existing C++ code. All you do is compile the C output file as C++ (or rename it to .cpp perhaps). 

Can you try using that and let me know if you think that there is anything that you could do if the runtime was C++ that you can't do right now? I don't really think that there will be.

You need to get the latest 3.1 snapshot from the downloads page and use the ANTLR Tool hjar in there. Then build the ANTLR 3.1 C runtime from the tar.gz in the dist director under the runtime/C directory in the snapshot. 3 or 4 people have successfully integrated their C++ code with the C target now and I think you will have similar success :-)

Hallo,

 

I'm new to the list. I'm trying to use ANTLR for generating a SQL parser because our current parser doesn't support Unicode input - it was generated by Lex/Yacc. We use C++ and we have our own complex AST that is used by a SQL engine already... So my idea is to write a tree adapter that would create our existing AST nodes (they would just inherit ANTLR tree interface).

 

And here comes a problem that ANTLR 3.x doesn't contain support for &quot;pure&quot; C++ implementation. I've just found Jim Idle's &quot;promise&quot;:

 

&gt;<i> Later I may well produce a complete C++ implementation from scratch,
</I>
&gt;<i> however, at this point I am not sure that it buys you anything. Please
</I>
&gt;<i> let me know if there are things you cannot do with the system as it
</I>
&gt;<i> stands (other than access the tokens and so on using C++ objects, which
</I>
&gt;<i> will be done later). 
</I>
 

I know that the problem could be solved with the current system somehow, but it would be probably very ugly. So yes, complete C++ implementation will buy us something! Or we can use ANTLR 2.x...

 

Right now we will probably try to build the AST by hand:

 

atom returns [OurNode* result]

@init { $result = NULL; }

:<i>              NUMBER
</I>
                {

                               std::string str((char*)$NUMBER.text-&gt;chars, $NUMBER.text-&gt;len);

                               $result = new OurNumberNode(str);

                };

 

Or do you have some other ideas?

 

Thanks

 

Tom

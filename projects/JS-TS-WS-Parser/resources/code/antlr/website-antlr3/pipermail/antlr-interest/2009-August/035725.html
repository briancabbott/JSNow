You're going to want to track that information anyway, in order to 
provide good error reporting (people will want to know that an 
error is on line 16 of include file B, not on line 152 of the 
input after preprocessing).

ANTLR already includes a line number with each token, and the 
filename is in the char stream.  You just need to link the token 
with the char stream it came from (which might even already be 
done; I haven't checked) and you should be good to go.


If you don't care about the error reporting, then the simplest 
thing to do is to run a complete preprocessing pass to merge all 
the include files before starting the &quot;real&quot; lex/parse/treewalk.

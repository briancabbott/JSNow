Your points #12 &amp; #13 cover a lot of what I would have liked to see on 
the front page. (That and enough context for someone new to known what 
they are talking about.)

&gt;<i> The step function learning problem is largely (I believe) one of 
</I>&gt;<i> learning how to design a recognition specification subject to the 
</I>&gt;<i> available mechanics of the Antlr language operators.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Oddly I was having a blast building and debugging my grammar. It was 
when I started trying to put int actions that stuff got difficult.

&gt;<i> That said, there are a number of caveats* that could be shared with 
</I>&gt;<i> those new to Antlr**:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 10) Use predicates to make clear what your code means.
</I>&gt;<i> 11) Unless performance is absolutely your top 6 design requirements, 
</I>&gt;<i> don't worry about using predicates.
</I>that would be &quot;don't worry about what predicates /cost/&quot;?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 12) Don't try to do too much in the lexer.  The parser is more 
</I>&gt;<i> powerful anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 13) Don't try to do too much in the parser.  Use tree-walkers to 
</I>&gt;<i> evolve an AST.
</I>
&gt;<i> 14) Don't try to dump complex blocks from a parser or AST.  Use 
</I>&gt;<i> StringTemplate to unparse.
</I>Does this hold if the final output is not a text file (e.g. in memory 
structures or a binary data file)
&gt;<i> 15) Actions (brace delimited statements) can be inserted almost anywhere.
</I>Yah, I wish I'd noticed that one sooner.

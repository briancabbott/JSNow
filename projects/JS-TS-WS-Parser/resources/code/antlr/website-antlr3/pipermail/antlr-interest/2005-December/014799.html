<PRE>Hello!

ANTLRWorks 1.0ea6 is now available at this URL:

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/works/index.html">http://www.antlr.org/works/index.html</A>

This version fixes and improves several things. I would like to  
emphasis some new features:
- new graphical representation of the parse tree (both in interpreter  
and debugger) that can be also exported to eps
- click on an input token in debugger selects the corresponding token  
in the grammar and in the parse tree
- breakpoints in the input text and in the grammar (the latest wasn't  
working correctly)
- refactoring feature to convert literals to/from single/double/c- 
style quote
- and much more

The ANTLRWorks jar has everything you need including the latest  
version of ANTLR 3.0ea7 and StringTemplate 2.3b4.

Mac OS X users can now download a special bundled version of  
ANTLRWorks: this version has a proper icon in the dock and allow the  
drag and drop of files into ANTLRWorks (like any good Mac OS X  
application).

The web page has been also updated with new images and a new video of  
the debugger in action (including the new graphical parse tree  
representation).

Enjoy this new release!

Jean Bovet

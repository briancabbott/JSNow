<PRE>Stephen,

The sources are supposed to be retrieved by the distributions tar, not
the source directory. When you expand the tar you will find that the
configure script is already there and you just need to do ./configure
--help and select the options you want (which is basically whether you
want 64 bits support and need archive or shared on AIX).

If you change the C.stg, it needs to be seen before the one in the jar.
Not sure of just how it picks up the precedence without looking at the
string template docs as I just rebuild antrl.jar.

However, I thought of that ;-) so there is:
@preinclude  (lexer:: or parser:: if you need that) which puts anything
in that section before the header includes antlr3.h

And

@includes

Which is inserted after the include of antrl3.h

Though, in general I don't use it like that as you can see from the C
examples. I make a yournamehere.h fir the project, which includes the
generated headers and only include that.

Anyway, I thought that there might be reasons that it was useful that I
had not thought of so I added it :-)

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jim,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> thanks for that.  Yeah, I already added the \x support, but it sowed
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> seeds of doubt that some other user syntax or lexical error may cause
</I>&gt;<i> the same problem.  I use Fedore core 3, and it seemed to recover by
</I>&gt;<i> killing the task once it asked for all 2Gbytes, but I don't know if XP
</I>&gt;<i> is equally robust.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, really nice job on the C target.  Much better documentation than
</I>&gt;<i> most open source projects.  I'm really looking forward to the C++
</I>&gt;<i> target, if only to eliminate the explicit passing of the 'this'
</I>&gt;<i> pointer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just a few points:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) I basically had little trouble getting it to work.  The only real
</I>&gt;<i> problem was that the sources don't come with a configure script
</I>already
&gt;<i> built, so one has to use autoconf.  To cut a long story short, I
</I>&gt;<i> eventually gave up on the GNU tools because makefile.in wasn't
</I>&gt;<i> available
</I>&gt;<i> so I couldn't successfully run automake.  It turned out to be easy to
</I>&gt;<i> create a config.h file from scratch, so that's what I ended up doing.
</I>&gt;<i> Nevertheless, you might want to add a working configure script and
</I>&gt;<i> makefile.am's as is done with most source distros, to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> inconvenience to those with back-level autoconf tools.  (Admittedly
</I>I'm
&gt;<i> all at sea with autoconf tools, so it's probably my stupidity).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Before I realized you had already ported Terrence's C grammar/Java
</I>&gt;<i> target to a C target, I was attempting to do so myself.  While doing
</I>&gt;<i> this, I found out that the @header stuff is put into both the .c and
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> .h files.  I really wanted to put the @header stuff in just the .h
</I>file
&gt;<i> (is that unreasonable?) so I decided to tweak the string template
</I>file.
&gt;<i> Lo and behold, the changes to the string templates were not noticed by
</I>&gt;<i> the antlr tool.  What am I missing?  I thought it was just a matter of
</I>&gt;<i> changing
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> $(ANTLR_HOME)/src/org/antlr/codegen/templates/C/C.stg
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> but it obviously isn't that simple...  Surely I don't have to rebuild
</I>&gt;<i> antlr - that would mean I'd have to get a java compiler - argh!
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I t sounds like an issue with the grammar that exposes an issue in
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; runtime, though something tells me that this may be related to an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; extremely recent change to deal with something related.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for pointing this out - I will endeavor to fix this tomorrow
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at least provide an answer/work around (which might be to allow \x
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sequences ;-).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allocation loop in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Ctarget C parser, antlr3.0
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'm tasked with some C-to-C translation, and have been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using the ANSI
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; C
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; grammar with the C target as a starting point, with antlr3.0.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The grammar inadvertently omits the possibility of using \x (hex)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; escapes in a literal string, and this causes an infinite memory
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; allocation loop when the parser is run against tokens such as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;\x00\x00&quot;.  The offending sequence of code is in
</I>&gt;<i> mSTRING_LITERAL(),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; which calls mEscapeSequence(), which in turn allocates an
</I>exception
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; struct (CONSTRUCTEX()) when it fails to understand the \x.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, the calling code is a for(;;) loop which does not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; advance
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the token stream, hence the lexer will allocate forever.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Sorry I'm really new to this, so it may be my fault, but it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; looks like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it may be a C target problem.  Didn't see any similar problem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; in the most recent archive.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; SJH
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I></PRE>

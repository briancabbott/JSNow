<PRE>Hello,

I can't help  but commenting on this: 

&lt;&lt;However, would you not be an early adopter of the modified 2.7.5?&gt;&gt;

It is a HUGHE difference moving from e.g. 2.7.4 to 2.7.5 or a new 2.7.6!
I also have a projected deeply coupled with 2.7.5 and its behavior e.g
when it comes to e.g. Exceptions, which is a **big deal** in a well
behaved production environment! I cannot for my life change to using 3.x
at this stage.

I find it very important that the ANTLR development team appreciates the
importance of this: Every one seems to say: Skip 2.7.x and move on to
3.x. For the next project, that might be OK, for the Current Production
/ Commercial projects I guess most users feel the same way.

However, would you not be an early adopter of the modified 2.7.5?
 
I like to think of it this way: you probably have a few more issues than
normal with the development phase but at some point you produce a parser
that you test the bejesus out of and it works. Once generated it will
always work (within the limits of what you were able to test) and
therefore it does not matter if it is generated by an early version of
ANTLR3 or not. Might well be a bit early yet though, I agree ;-)
 
Jim

That does sound nice, but I'm working in a production environment and
cannot afford the risks associated with being an early adopter.

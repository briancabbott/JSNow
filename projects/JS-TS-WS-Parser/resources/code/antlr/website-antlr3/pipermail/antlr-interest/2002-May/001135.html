&gt;<i> &gt; Erm....Terrence are you there?  ;-)

&gt;<i> those wacky mysterious tables at the bottom of the Character.java 
</I>source.

And now you've got me doing the same ;-)

The 
&gt;<i> only problem is that we'll have to convert LOWERCASE_LETTER to a 
</I>&gt;<i> straight bitset that maps char -&gt; yes/no if it's in that set.  So 
</I>we 
&gt;<i> could do test LA(1), the next char of lookahead, against it.  Also, 
</I>&gt;<i> don't forget that ANTLR needs to do the grammar analysis so that it 
</I>can 
&gt;<i> determine if you have a nondetermism.  For example, I presume the 
</I>&gt;<i> following would be ambiguous/nondeterministic:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> DUH : LOWERCASE_LETTER | BASIC_LATIN | BENGALI ;
</I>
Perhaps a restriction on combining pre-defined UnicodeBlocks and 
UnicodeCategories in this manner since they rarely make sense 
together?

I see UnicodeBlock as being more useful in setting CharVocabulary 
option although that may just be because I'm relatively unfamilair 
with them. In fact I think that is what it is.....ignore me.

&gt;<i> I believe I could predefine all these character categories and then 
</I>&gt;<i> simply let you refer to them.  Note that for every set you 
</I>reference 
&gt;<i> though would be a potentially very big uncompressed bitset.  Worst 
</I>case, 
&gt;<i> if you have digit \uFFFE defined, you'd have about 65 kilobits in 
</I>the 
&gt;<i> set or about 8k per bitset.  Every time I have to combine this set 
</I>with 
&gt;<i> a character or another set, that's another 8k worst case.  I could 
</I>&gt;<i> probably make a simple compression that ignored long runs of zeros 
</I>on 
&gt;<i> the front of the bit set.
</I>
Perhaps a separation of BitSet's implementation from it's interface 
so one could create a SparseRangeBitSet implementation that simply 
stores a list of the ranges of &quot;YES&quot; characters (or NO depending 
which is more compact) permitted as perhaps two int arrays and only 
generates a &quot;traditional&quot; BitSet if it is essential to do so.

&gt;<i> Is this the kind of thing you would need?  I.e., to be able to 
</I>&gt;<i> specifically refer to predefined Java character blocks as 
</I>predefined 
&gt;<i> ANTLR &quot;characters&quot;?
</I>
Yes, that would a very good start for better Unicode support in ANTLR.

Cheers,

Micheal

PS     Would you be kind enough to look at my original post please?
       I would like your opinion on choosing between (b) and (c) and, 
the questions I raised about both [ e.g. how to shut off the warnings 
on (b) ]

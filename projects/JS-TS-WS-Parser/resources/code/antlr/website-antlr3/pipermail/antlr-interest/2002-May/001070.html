I think that your idea is good, but not quite on target.  I think that 
the items you mention tend to have to do with grammar structuring 
(a catalog of refactoring principles would be useful), rewriting, and 
interfacing to backend processors.  These are all worthy topics.  Some 
specifics follow.

&gt;<i> thinking about, to whit:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Expression parsers with precedence
</I>
This is a tree structuring issue, and the principle is &quot;structure your 
grammar so that the syntax trees reflect operator precedence&quot;.  The 
Calc examples demonstrate this.

&gt;<i> * Successively applied tree parsers for optimization/transformation 
</I>&gt;<i> sequences
</I>
This is on applying rewrite rules for grammar transformation.  There 
has been quite a bit of research on rewriting, and it would be 
interesting to interface the BURG (bottom up rewrite 
generator)algorithm with ANTLR to do the &quot;match pattern and rewrite&quot; 
approach to rule and tree transformation (as opposed to ANTLR's match 
rule and rewrite according to user annotations).

BTW, I just received a letter that okays release of my rewriting 
support and tree grammar generation extensions under copyright.  Now I 
have to find out what else I need to do to actually release it, but I 
can hope for an early June release.  This is probably a good starting 
point for incorporating meta-level rewrite rules--the extensions 
generate a syntax tree for the output grammar from an input grammar.

&gt;<i> * Text scanners (like Ter's &quot;really big lookahead&quot; article) vs...
</I>&gt;<i> * Compilers
</I>
This is a matter of interfacing to a backend.  An interesting start in 
this direction would be for someone to generate RTL from a transformed 
ANTLR syntax tree.  Monty's GNU C grammar is much cleaner than the GNU 
C flex/bison (at least the gcc front end used to be a case of &quot;abandon 
hope all ye who enter here&quot;--I haven't looked at the source since a 
1.xx release) and an ANTLR C++ front end would be a major improvement.

&gt;<i> * Interpreters
</I>
I don't know of an interpreter written in ANTLR, although Ter has 
provided a few hooks for the purpose.  It would be interesting to hear 
of any experiences with ANTLR in this area.

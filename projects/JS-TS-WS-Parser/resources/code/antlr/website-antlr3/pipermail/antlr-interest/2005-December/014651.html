<PRE>However, would you not be an early adopter of the modified 2.7.5?
 
I like to think of it this way: you probably have a few more issues than normal with the development phase but at some point you produce a parser that you test the bejesus out of and it works. Once generated it will always work (within the limits of what you were able to test) and therefore it does not matter if it is generated by an early version of ANTLR3 or not. Might well be a bit early yet though, I agree ;-)

That does sound nice, but I'm working in a production environment
and cannot afford the risks associated with being an early adopter.

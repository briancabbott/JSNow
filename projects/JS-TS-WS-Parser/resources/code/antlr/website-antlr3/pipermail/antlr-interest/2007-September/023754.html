Thanks for your response. What exactly do you mean by &quot;imposing a CFG on
top of the tree?&quot; What I understand by this is you have a tree walker
pass in which you generate a CFG which points to the appropriate nodes
in the AST. Given this mapping, you can then transform as a result of
traversing the components of the graph and determining some
optimizations. This sounds to me like I would have to write some C++
code to generate a ANTLR tree which sounds like I'm using the tool wrong.

As an aside: having never written an optimizing compiler before myself,
I wonder if you can suggest any practical literature about the data
structures involved in (efficient) program optimization.

Thanks again,

Sohail

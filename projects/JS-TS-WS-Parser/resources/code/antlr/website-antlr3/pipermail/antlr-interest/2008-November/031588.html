<PRE>Piggybacking on a recent post about import issues, I'm having trouble
understanding how everything fits together.

&gt;<i>From the Wiki, I've figured out that lexer grammars can only import
</I>lexer grammars, parser grammars can only import parser grammars, and
combined grammars can only import lexer or parser grammars, but not
combined grammars.

If I read this correctly, you can only have a single combined grammar
in any grammar you write that imports other grammars and it has to be
*the* grammar that imports all the other grammars. Is that correct?

Is it also the case that a tokens section is only allowed in a
combined grammar? I know it's not allowed in a lexer grammar, but it
doesn't seem like it would make sense at all in a parser grammar, so
then there can only be one tokens section in any grammar that consists
of more than a single file. Again, is that correct?

Given these constraints, can somebody provide a decent heuristic for
how to break up grammars? I've got a bunch of pieces that need to fit
together, but given the constraints on putting them together, I'm not
sure where to start. I have some rules that combine parsing with
lexing and these can only go in the grammar that imports everything
else, but they don't logically belong there.

Am I missing something basic here, or is the grammar inheritance
system a work in progress that's still a bit too picky to be as useful
as it could be?

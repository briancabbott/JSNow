<PRE>That should have been RecognizerSharedState. IF you use the object browser
to look at the runtime assembly created by the VS2005 .sln file, you will
find that this is where the variable followingStackPointer (FSP) is not
kept. Hence the code generated by 3.0.1 cannot see it. I synced back to the
binary that was there before Ter deleted it, and it works correctly there
because followingStackPointer is held in the parser class.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Before I revert to the previous version, does anyone know why this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might suddenly be the case or is it just that the C# .sln for VS2005
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that is now in the depot is no quite up to scratch, or something else
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; altogether?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've put new versions of some project files up, which finally use

</I>&gt;<i> VS
</I>&gt;<i> 2005 files. I don't have VS 2003, so I didn't enter the symbol NET_1_1
</I>&gt;<i> into the build context of that solution. This isn't probably the cause
</I>&gt;<i> of your problem, as the treated classes aren't referenced by runtime
</I>&gt;<i> itself, but only by generated parsers. Anyway, the solution file is
</I>&gt;<i> still at revision one and hasn't changed in my local workspace. The
</I>&gt;<i> project works otherwise fine on my notebook.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Actually, the previous version does work perfectly. It seems that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there is now something called ParserSharedState in which the fsp is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; kept, but it is either not inherited or not public enough for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; generated code to use it. Is the current code supposed to be usable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the source code based runtime, or is it in some quasi-state at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the moment?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What is FSP? The source code itself should work as well the 3.0
</I>&gt;<i> version,
</I>&gt;<i> as far my tests tell me so far. ParserSharedState isn't mentioned in
</I>&gt;<i> one
</I>&gt;<i> single file of the entire workspace and otherwise unknown to me. Can
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> find out which file exactly doesn't work at the current revision for
</I>&gt;<i> you?

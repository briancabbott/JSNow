<PRE>How do I get extra code .e.g. a package statement into the generated 
Java files from the .g file? I've been using jflex/cup and am used 
to having specific block where I can write code that is just copied 
into the generated Java files. I have searched on-line and in the 
documentation for &quot;package&quot; in relation to ANTLR but did not come up 
with any matches that answered this basic question.  I also looked 
at a couple examples but, probably because they were simple, did not 
obviously place the generated code into a package.

Sorry to be asking such a newbie question. I added stuff to my ant 
script to stick it the package statement in figuring I'd eventually 
run across the answer as I read the doc's but I haven't yet.

Thanks,

Clay

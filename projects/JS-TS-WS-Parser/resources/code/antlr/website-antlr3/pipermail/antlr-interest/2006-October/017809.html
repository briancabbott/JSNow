<PRE>Is the deep analysis that Andy Tripp's COBOL to Java project requires
a corner case of ANTLR usage? It seems to me he's building at least a
full dataflow graph, which I believe is more extreme than most
transformations.

My projects with antlr include things like &quot;replicate bash's
brace-expansion in a standalone tool&quot;, and &quot;convert pure lambda
calculus to continuation-passing style&quot;.

As far as I can tell, these tasks are not &quot;99% static analysis and 1%
tree transformation&quot;. Admittedly, I have no working code, so perhaps
you should take my opinions with dash of salt.

</I>&gt;<i> with your
</I>&gt;<i> complicated data structure, I just want to store the fact that you're
</I>&gt;<i> adding one number to another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And then the next day, the problem goes the other way. The COBOL guy
</I>&gt;<i> realizes that
</I>&gt;<i> the Java guy is going to need to know that B is 10 digits before the
</I>&gt;<i> decimal, 5 after the decimal,
</I>&gt;<i> and a particular precision. The Java guy eventually realizes
</I>&gt;<i> that he can't even use &quot;B += A&quot;, he's got to use BigDecimal. That
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't bother him so much
</I>&gt;<i> as the term &quot;digits&quot;.  &quot;You're going to tell me how many 'digits' it
</I>&gt;<i> is???&quot; He screams.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Don't you mean bytes?&quot; No, he really does mean &quot;digits&quot;. And you
</I>&gt;<i> haven't seen nothin' yet,
</I>&gt;<i> Java guy. Wait till he tells you how to store those digits on disk in
</I>&gt;<i> packed decimal format.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So in the end, the &quot;generic representation&quot; can't really be &quot;generic&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> The Java guy just wants to know
</I>&gt;<i> whether a variable is a &quot;int&quot; or a &quot;long&quot;, while the COBOL guy wants to
</I>&gt;<i> say how many digits it is
</I>&gt;<i> before and after the decimal. OK, I suppose you could make it generic,
</I>&gt;<i> you can store both,
</I>&gt;<i> or have the &quot;generic representation&quot; automatically
</I>&gt;<i> convert between the two. But things are going very badly and you just
</I>&gt;<i> got started :)

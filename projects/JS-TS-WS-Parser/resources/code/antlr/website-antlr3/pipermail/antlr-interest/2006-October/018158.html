<PRE>That sorta works because if I put a &quot;returns [int cs]&quot; on the rule, then
I get a declaration &quot;int cs;&quot; in the output.  But reading wiki examples, I
came away with the impression that when I put a label, say cs, on something,
then the method getText() becomes available for the variable cs.  For the
generated code to actually compile however, and using your suggestion, I
would have to know the internals of antlr so I can put a proper &quot;returns
[xxx cs]&quot; on whatever rule needs it.  Am I really expected to delve into the
internals of antlr to figure out what the node types are?

Maybe there's a disconnect between what I'm trying to do and a proper usage
of antlr.  I'm not trying to build an AST that I can later walk... I'm
working on a testing framework that needs to recognize a certain language
and fire off actions as the input is  recognized.  Seems like ANTLR could do
that, no?

By the way, I didn't say this earlier, but my target language is c++, and
the action I put in wasn't valid c++ code but that's easily fixed once I see
a valid &quot;cs&quot; declaration somewhere.

thanks,
Rick

&gt;<i>The type of cs depends on the return type of your classSpec rule.  If it
</I>&gt;<i>currently doesn't return anything then it's expected that ANTLR won't put a
</I>&gt;<i>declaration of your variable in there as there is nothing to store
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i>Hi, just discovered antlr 2 days ago, so pretty new at this... I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>trying to discover how actions I specify are placed in the generated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>code so I wrote the following inside a rule:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>( cs:classSpec { initEntity( cs.getText() ); } )*
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i>As expected, the generated code contained initEntity( cs.getText() );
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i>Problem is there is no declaration of cs.  I could declare it myself
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>somewhere if I new what type it was but I doubt that is the correct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>solution.  I ran this test using both the command line tool (java
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>antlr.Tool verbTest.g) and using an Eclipse plugin, both do not generate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>a declaration for cs.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i>I reread the wiki entries for labels several times, but it doesn't go
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>into these details.  I'm using antlr version 2.7.7rc1.

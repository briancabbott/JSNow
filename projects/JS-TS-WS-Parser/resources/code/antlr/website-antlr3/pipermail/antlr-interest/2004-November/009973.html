<PRE>
My vote would go for &quot;helper&quot; or &quot;subrule&quot;.

As I understand it, though, the important difference is that these rules
are &quot;expanded&quot; and don't exist in their own right in the generated code,
so as long as that's made clear in the docu then okay.

I think I'd actually go for &quot;helper&quot; or &quot;helperule&quot;. Then the docu says
that a &quot;helper&quot; is an imaginary construct in the grammar that doesn't
get carried into the generated code :-)

Cheers,
Wol

&gt;<i> The problem with protected (equally private) is that the intended
</I>meaning
&gt;<i> is a side effect of the main meaning of the word.  The above snippet
</I>&gt;<i> would be clear to anybody just casually looking at a new 3.0 grammar,
</I>&gt;<i> right?
</I>
Eek! No!  Then it would be impossible/confusing/etc., in conversation,
to
distinguish between (normal) rules that are used by other rules and
&quot;helper&quot; rules that are used by other rules.

Take care,
	John

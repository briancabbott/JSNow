<PRE>Hi,

thanks for the answers so far. I found something out, too. If i just swap
the lines for NEWLINE and WS, the grammar behaves differently, the NEWLINE
then is not matched. So i guess the order, in which those rules are set in
the grammar, makes a difference. Nevertheless, actually i would have
thought, the correct way to set the rules for NEWLINE and WS would be:

NEWLINE     :     '\r'? '\n';
WS    :     (' '|'\t')+ {skip();};

Means, i do not put \n and \r in WS.

Perhaps i should simply read on in the book ;o)

Betreff: Re: [antlr-interest] distinction between newline and ws

[forgot to reply all]

I can't find the documentation for it, but ANTLR does seem to have token
matching precedence rules.

Have a play with it - write a tokeniser like this:

test : ( TEXT | NEWLINE | WS )*;
TEXT : 'x'+;

NEWLINE&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; :&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; '\r'? '\n';
WS&#160;&#160;&#160; :&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (' '|'\t'|'\n'|'\r')+;

and pass it some strings with newlines and whitespace and whatnot. Have a
look at the token stream generated. I've got a feeling that antlr prefers to
match earlier tokens to later tokens. Using your rules, I expect that a line
of text followed immediately by a newline will become TEXT NEWLINE whereas a
line of text followed by whitespace then a newline will be TEXT WS. This is
because by default the + in the WS rule is greedy and will consume the
newline as well, if it can.

Have a play!

hello,
&#160;
i am very new to antlr and language recognition. So i bought the book
from Terence Parr and now i am currently working through the first
example, the calculator. And unfortunately already, i don&#146;t understand
something. The grammar looks like this:
&#160;
grammar Expr;
&#160;
prog&#160; :&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; stat+ ;
&#160;
stat&#160; :&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; expr NEWLINE
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; |&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; ID '=' expr NEWLINE
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; |&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NEWLINE
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; ;
&#160;
expr&#160; :&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; multExpr (('+'|'-') multExpr)* ;
&#160;
multExpr:&#160;&#160; atom ('*' atom)* ;
&#160;
atom&#160; :&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; INT
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; |&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; ID
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; |&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; '(' expr ')'
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; ;
&#160;
ID&#160;&#160;&#160; :&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z')+;
INT&#160;&#160; :&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; '0'..'9'+;
NEWLINE&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; :&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; '\r'? '\n';
WS&#160;&#160;&#160; :&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (' '|'\t'|'\n'|'\r')+ {skip();};
&#160;
My Question now is, how does antrl know, that &#147;\n&#148; should match to a NEWLINE
instead
of WS (which would mean, it would skip it)? I would have thought, this
grammar is
ambiguous, but apparantly, it isn&#146;t. Why not?
&#160;
Thank you
Sven

<PRE>Prashant:
 
Ok, but I didn't watch the videos, I tend to ignore things like that (I have
Flash blocked too). I'm a &quot;just give me the facts&quot; kind of guy. You should
have something on the web site making it clear what the product is, and what
its requirements are.  That's pretty standard stuff for any product.
 
In any case, yes, I know I need to download Java and Eclipse. I think you
kinda missed the point of my message. There's lots of links on the Eclipse
download page. Knowing nothing whatsoever about Eclipse, how is one supposed
to know what is needed to run your plug in?  Is the SDK enough? Do I need
the Java Development tools or the Plugin Environment or the Platform? How
about the Visual Editor?
 
And if you go to Sun's site, there's links to all sorts of things named
&quot;java&quot; this and &quot;java&quot; that. There's &quot;Java 2 Standard Edition&quot; on the
downloads page, and there's links to J2SE 5.0, J2SE 1.4.2 and J2SE 1.3.1.  I
don't see any &quot;JVM 1.5&quot;.
 
One of your earlier posts today started out: &quot;As you guys already know, if
you try using AS(ANTLR Studio) with AE(ANTLR Eclipse)...&quot;  No, not of us
&quot;already know&quot;. That's the point I was trying to make in my original post.
If you're only focused on those who already know Java and Eclipse, that's
fine.  Maybe that's covers most of the Antlr community, but you shouldn't
assume that everyone already knows about any particular platform, language
or development environment.
 
A short &quot;here's how to get started on a Windows machine without Java&quot;
document would be a great help. I'd invest the time to look at Antlr Studio
if I knew exactly what to install to get up and running with a minimum of
fuss. But I don't have time to go digging around Sun's site or figuring out
what parts of Eclipse I need to install. Like most developers, I've got too
much work to get done and too few hours in the day to do it &lt;g&gt;.

Hi Don,
  Actually the videos make it quite clear that it is for eclipse.

And you can use it for C++, although debugging wont work in such a case.
But you can easily use the grammar editor to type your antlr grammar and put
c++ code inside the actions.

To run AS, you need to download JVM 1.5 from Sun's site and Eclipse 3.1 from
eclipse.org :)

This may not be the kind of feedback you were looking for, so take it for
whatever it's worth.
 
I'm a Windows, C++ guy. I spend most of my life inside Visual Studio, and I
don't know anything about Java or Eclipse. I have plenty of C++ work and
precious little spare time, so I really have no desire to tinker with Java
or Eclipse. It's hard enough to find time to cut the grass.
 
I go to your web site in anticipation of downloading an IDE for Antlr. Nice
screen shots, looks really interesting. .But nowhere does it say that this
is a plug-in for some other IDE, at least nowhere that was obvious to me. I
eventually figure that out and do a Google search for Eclipse. Now I'm faced
with a large array of things to download. Do I just need the Eclipse SDK, or
do I need any of the other stuff?
 
Then I notice that you need Java to run Eclipse. Great. Now I'm faced with
the prospect of downloading three things from three different sources,
hoping I choose the right downloads and that I install them in the proper
order, and hoping that they'll all play nice and work together.  And more
important, I have to hope that installing all this stuff doesn't somehow
hose up my development machine.
 
Faced with the prospect of wasting many hours trying to get all of this to
work vs., getting back to the mountain of work I have to do, I close my
browser and get back to work.
 
Now, I realize that your target audience is probably Java people and
installing Java and Eclipse might be as simple to you guys as installing
Visual Studio is to me.  If there was some assurance that this stuff is
fairly painless to install and get running, I'd take a look at Antlr Studio
and most likely, purchase a copy, as long as it can work with Antlr's C++
generated parsers. No interest in creating or debugging Java-based parsers.
C# would be a plus, but C++ is a must.
 
I looked for some hand-holding article on your web site, but didn't find
anything at all that would help a Java/Eclipse-challenged programmer such as
myself. Maybe most of the people in the Antlr world are Java people, so I
realize that this might not be worth your time. 
 
My 2 cents, hope its useful.
 
Don

I forgot to mention that you will need-
Eclipse 3.1 or higher
Java 5 or higher
to install Antlr Studio.

Ok, wait is finally over :)

You can download it from -

Note that the new web site and the shopping system are not available yet, so
i am still calling this a beta.
For details please look at my latest blog posting.

<PRE>The other lot to try are O'Reilly :-)

I don't know how easy it is to swing it with them, but they publish
several books where the pdfs are freely available on the web. Probably
the deal is they pay not much in royalties, but the pdfs advertise the
hard copy from O'R.

However, you might need to be a well-known author or have a book they
reckon a lot of people will want to buy anyway in order to swing a deal
like that.

Cheers,
Wol

I was actually hoping to pull a similar stunt with a book I wrote.  I
asked
my publisher about it and they insisted that with current publishing
technologies the book would never go out of print and that they could
make
new printings on demand.  Bummer.  I wonder why this worked for Terence.

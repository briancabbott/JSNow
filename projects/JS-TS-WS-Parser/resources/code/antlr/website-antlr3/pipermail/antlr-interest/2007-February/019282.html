<PRE>hey dudes, take it easy...

it looks like we are still in a free world, so hopefully everyone is 
free to believe everything he wants, and the fact that java pays your 
meals doesn't seem a good reason to take that up so seriously.
Randall already saved the java-pride without making it a national 
security issue, we were all friends as before and for me there was 
certainly no need to give it a follow up.
it was not my intention to offend anyone, and if my unhappy answer with 
its unrespectful question mark and smiles has hurt any of you, I beg you 
my excuses, really.

Anyway, since I'm the thirteen here, please be more mature than me and 
don't reply, neither I'll answer, and hopefully this accident ends here.


happy parsing,
Maurizio

<PRE>We have this application in production that uses Antlr 2.7.  (Antlr was
a major factor in the creation of this successful product.)  While
upgrading the application, I also tried upgrading to Antrl 3.0.1, only
to find that the CSharp runtime seems to be broken.  Is this true?  Does
nobody use Antlr 3.0.1 with C# on Visual Studio?  The symptom is that
the ANTRLInputStream constructor hangs.  I found while googling that a
couple others had reported the same problem, but there appeared to be no
response offering a solution.

 

Interestingly, one of my google hits was some source code written by
Kunle Odutola that contains this test case (note the name of the
method):

 

[Test]

                public void TestANTLRInputStreamConstructorDoesNotHang()

                {

                                Encoding encoding = Encoding.Unicode;

                                byte[] grammarStrBuffer =
encoding.GetBytes(grammarStr);

                                MemoryStream grammarStream = new
MemoryStream(grammarStrBuffer);

 

                                ANTLRInputStream input = new
ANTLRInputStream(grammarStream, encoding);

                }

 

Using that same sequence of statements hangs when I try it.

 

If somebody knows the status of this problem or could point out what
bone-headed thing I might be doing wrong, I would appreciate it.

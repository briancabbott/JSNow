I think that you represent the pragmatic &quot;make it work now&quot; view fairly well.  I also think that the exchange

&gt;<i> Nonsense. Any lexer that consumes characters that aren't a legal token,

&gt;<i> and announces a legal token without flagging an error, has a bug.
</I>

represents a real frustration with the defect recognition process.  It took Ter well over a year to fix the premature optimization of synpreds during which time the mantra was &quot;This isn't a bug&quot;; meanwhile, there were grammars which could not be implemented in ANTLR 3.  I suspect that Austin's, Gavin's and my reaction would be very different if the response had been &quot;Hmm.  I do not see how to fix this right now and am not sure I want to, but I will add it to the bug list.  In the meantime ...&quot;.  The point of making bug reports is not &quot;Help!  I need a workaround!&quot; as a rule, although that may be part of it, but rather &quot;If this were fixed, it would improve the utility and user-friendliness of ANTLR&quot;.  The LL* algorithm is very nice, but there are still some rough edges with the implementation that need to be recognized and fixed; these rough edges do not have to be smoothed right away (there are workarounds), but they do need to be recognized so that they
 can eventually be fixed.

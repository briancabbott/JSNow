<PRE>There is currently no automated way I know of to do that.  Someone very
familiar with ANTLR should be able to reconstruct a grammar for you though.
If you have the money you can hire me as a consultant to do it.  Contact me
through www.codetransform.com.  Otherwise you can start making grammars and
inspect the generated source code and figure out how to reverse engineer it.
That's a great way to learn how antlr works too!

Subject: [antlr-interest] reengineering from generated java to grammar
source


hey,
We have bumped into a serious problem.  We currently have few java 
class files that were generated using a grammar file with antlr 
sometime in the year 2000.  Unfortunately, we don't have any 
remainings of the grammar file.  is there a way to do some re- engineering
to generate the grammar file from the generated java 
source files ?

if that's possible, I can decompile the java class files to java 
source and then generate the grammar file.

Please let me know if there's a way.

regards,
-venky

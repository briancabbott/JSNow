<PRE>Simple little problem, just I don't know how to do it, and it doesn't
work like it does in the lexer ...

gotost : (GOTO^ (INT { $setType( IDENT); } | IDENT) (COLON | {
$append(&quot;:&quot;); } ) )
// if int, we want to change the type to ident. If no colon, then append
it to text.
	;

GOTO can be followed by either an INT or an IDENT, and then an optional
colon. (And I think my grammar is slightly wrong here too ...)

What I want to end up with is GOTO^ IDENT, where the text of IDENT has a
trailing colon.

Actually, I've just realised I'm well off down the wrong track here, I
can just trap all of this in the treeparser, but (a) I would still like
to know how to do it, and (b) for Ter - the manual covers lexing and
parsing as being pretty much the same thing. I would have thought things
like this are a major difference that should be documented and I can't
find it in the lexing chapter...

Cheers,
Wol

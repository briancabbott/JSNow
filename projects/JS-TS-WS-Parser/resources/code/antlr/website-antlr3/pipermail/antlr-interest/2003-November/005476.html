I am just wondering. If we had a custom language with ANTLR as Terence 
proposed to be independent of the destination language (Java, C#, C++) I 
really think this sort of transaction behavior could be implemented. I 
am into transactional caching in the moment and the mechanisms seem to 
be quite similar minus concurrent stuff (which is the complex part). 
This means it would be fairly easy if you could controll the way objects 
in your meta-language are accessed. Although, while saying this it 
sounds much more fun to build than actually useful to me.

Comments?

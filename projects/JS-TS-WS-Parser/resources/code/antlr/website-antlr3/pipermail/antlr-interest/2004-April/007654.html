<PRE>Hi,

Now that I have been using the ANTLR smart pointers for some time,
I have to admit that ASTRefCount has to be rewritten as well. The
current implementation turned out to be a bit buggy.

As I've found out, `operator=(const T*)' and `operator T*()' are unsafe
(in Boost, for example, these aren't defined at all). When implemented
together, not only they are unsafe, they are rather dangerous since they
can lead to nonshared ownership of a single object and therefore to its
premature deletion.

Consider the code from BaseAST.cpp (the problems I experience now are
caused by the implicit misuse of smart pointers in this function):

void BaseAST::addChild( RefAST c )
{
    if( !c )
        return;

    RefBaseAST tmp = down;

    if (tmp)
    {
        while (tmp-&gt;right)
            tmp = tmp-&gt;right;
        tmp-&gt;right = c;
    }
    else
        down = c;
}

Here when `c' is assigned to `right' or `down', assignment of
`ASTRefCount&lt;AST&gt;' to `ASTRefCount&lt;BaseAST&gt;' is performed and at this
point `c' is implicitly converted to `AST*' and then the `operator=(T*)'
is engaged, thus separating the ownership.

Now I have something like the following in the grammar:

rule
{
    RefAST ast = #[TOKEN];
}
:<i>
</I>    (
        index:expression
        {
            ast-&gt;addChild(#index);
        }
    )+
;

And as the new `expression' is assigned to `index', the reference count
for the old falls to zero and the object is deleted instead of staying
in memory until the reference in the tree is released as well. When I
then call getNumberOfChildren() the program hangs :(


Best regards,
  Andrey Urazov

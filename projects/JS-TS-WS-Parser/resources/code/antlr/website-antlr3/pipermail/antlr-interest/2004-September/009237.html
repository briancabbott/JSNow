If the archive goes back to the 2.7.0 era I guess it should be sufficient.
Sort by date should not be hard to make.

</I>
Gmane is a very quick way to get results. I already tried a bit around with
their search and it's vastly superior to the yahoogroups excuse for a
search. Also their email obscuring stuff seems to work ok. If you got a
mbox format thing lying about then I could not think of a reason to not
have it imported there. (while maybe working on a proprietary solution)

&gt;<i> Seems like I should find a simple means of displaying the email messages at

</I>&gt;<i> in absolute control of my destiny and data ;)
</I>
There's quite a number of packages for displaying mail archives (Mhonarc
for one) so it should not be hard I guess. Add a generic small site spider
like htDig (www.htdig.org) to the mix and you got something I'd be happy
with for one ;)

&gt;<i> 3. Email addresses are all over the archives, which is a drag to 
</I>&gt;<i> expose, but you'll note that your addresses are all already exposed on 
</I>&gt;<i> the yahoogroups web pages.  So, i'm not sure this a &quot;problem&quot;.
</I>
You could just mangle them all with a script before importing them
somewhere.

Cheers,

Ric

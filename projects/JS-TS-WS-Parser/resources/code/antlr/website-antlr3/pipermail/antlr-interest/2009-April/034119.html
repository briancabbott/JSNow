                       Call for Papers - SLE 2009

    2nd International Conference on Software Language Engineering

                     <A HREF="http://planet-sl.org/sle2009">http://planet-sl.org/sle2009</A>

                 Denver, Colorado, October 5-6, 2009

___________________________________________________________________

           Co-located with 12th International Conference on
    Model-Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS 2009)
                and 8th International Conference on
     Generative Programming and Component Engineering (GPCE 2009)

Proceedings will be published in the LNCS series (subject to
Springer's approval).

The 2nd International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE)
is devoted to topics related to artificial languages in software
engineering. SLE's foremost mission is to encourage and organize
communication between communities that have traditionally looked
at software languages from different, more specialized, and yet
complementary perspectives. SLE emphasizes the fundamental notion
of languages as opposed to any realization in specific &quot;technical
spaces&quot;. SLE 2009 will be co-located with the 12th IEEE/ACM
International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering Languages and
Systems (MODELS 2009).


Scope
-----

The term 'software language' comprises all sorts of artificial
languages used in software development including general-purpose
programming languages, domain-specific languages, modeling and
meta-modeling languages, data models, and ontologies. Used in its
broadest sense, examples include modeling languages such as
UML-based and domain-specific modeling languages, business process
modeling languages, and web application modeling languages.  The
term 'software language' also comprises APIs and collections of
design patterns that are implicitly defined languages.

Software language engineering is the application of a systematic,
disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, use, and
maintenance of these languages. Thus, the SLE conference is
concerned with all phases of the life cycle of software languages;
these include the design, implementation, documentation, testing,
deployment, evolution, recovery, and retirement of languages. Of
special interest are tools, techniques, methods and formalisms that
support these activities. In particular, tools are often based on
or even automatically generated from a formal description of the
language. Hence, of special interest is the treatment of language
descriptions as software artifacts, akin to programs - while paying
attention to the special status of language descriptions, subject
to tailored engineering principles and methods for modularization,
refactoring, refinement, composition, versioning, co-evolution,
and analysis.


Topics of interest
------------------

We solicit high-quality contributions in the area of SLE ranging
from theoretical and conceptual contributions to tools, techniques
and frameworks that support the aforementioned life cycle activities.
Some examples of tools, techniques, applications, and problems are
listed below in order to clarify the types of contributions sought
by SLE.

* Formalisms used in designing and specifying languages and tools
  that analyze such language descriptions.

* Language implementation techniques, grammar-based and
  metamodel-based.


* Program and model transformation tools.

* Composition, integration, and mapping tools for managing different
  aspects of software languages or different manifestations of a
  given language.

* Language evolution.

* Approaches to the elicitation, specification, and verification of
  requirements for software languages.

* Language development frameworks, methodologies, techniques, best
  practices, and tools for the broader language life cycle covering
  phases such as analysis, testing, and documentation.

* Design challenges in SLE.

* Applications of languages including innovative domain-specific
  languages or &quot;little&quot; languages

Do note that this list is not exclusive and many examples of tools,
techniques, approaches have not been listed. Please visit the
conference web site to see a more elaborate description of the
topics of interests. The program committee chairs encourage potential
contributors to contact them with questions about the scope and
topics of interest of SLE.


Paper Submission
----------------

We solicit the following types of papers:

 * Research papers. These should report a substantial research
   contribution to SLE and/or successful application of SLE
   techniques. Full paper submissions must not exceed 20 pages.

 * Short papers. These may describe interesting or thought-provoking
   concepts that are not yet fully developed or evaluated, make an
   initial contribution to challenging research issues in SLE, or
   discuss and analyze controversial issues in the field. These papers
   must not exceed 10 pages.

 * Tool demonstration papers. Because of SLE's ample interest in
   tools, we seek papers that present software tools related to the
   field of SLE. These papers will accompany a tool demonstration to
   be given at the conference. These papers must not exceed 10
   pages. The selection criteria include the originality of the tool,
   its innovative aspects, the relevance of the tool to SLE, and the
   maturity of the tool. Submissions may also include an appendix
   (that will not be published) containing additional screen-shots and
   discussion of the proposed demonstration.

 * Mini-tutorial papers. SLE is composed of various research areas,
   such as grammarware, modelware, language schemas, and semantic
   technologies. The cross product of attendees at SLE creates a
   situation where the contribution from one session may be difficult
   to understand by those not initiated to the area. To help unite the
   various communitues of SLE 2009, mini-tutorials are solicited
   that provide discussion points for mapping common ideas between the
   area and differentiating among variations. A mini-tutorial submisson
   should be between 15 and 20 pages.

Submitted articles must not have been previously published or currently
be submitted for publication elsewhere. All submitted papers will be
closely reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. All
accepted papers will be made available at the conference in the
pre-proceedings and published in the post-proceedings of the conference,
which will appear in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.
Authors will have the opportunity to revise their accepted paper for the
pre- and post-proceedings.

All papers must be formatted by following Springer's LNCS style and
must be submitted using EasyChair (open early June):

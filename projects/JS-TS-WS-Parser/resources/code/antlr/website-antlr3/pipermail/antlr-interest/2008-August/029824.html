<PRE>Hi Kay

 &gt;&gt;Enough babbling, however.
 &gt;&gt; This is an argument neither side can &quot;win&quot;, simply because there's 
no correct answer.
Think so... the correct answer is the closest to the common sense and 
natural location: that is the (1,1) based coordinate...

BTW, in PL/1, you can declare an vector/array with fixed lower bound and 
higher bound as

DECLARE FOO (10::20) FIXED BIN(15);

and while the FOO vector is allocated from address 0 up to address 9, 
all the references as FOO(NO) will be checked against 10 &lt;= NO &lt;= 20)


 &gt;&gt;For the reason given above, I think ANTLR should not change its 
behavior at this point.
ANTLR has already changed... ANTLR v2 column/line is (1,1) based...  (so 
think about all people moving their grammar from V2 to V3...) So I would 
like ANTLR v3 to use also the (1,1) coordinate...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; off the top of my head, i know two languages that start counting

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cobol i ever knew, i simply accept that cobol is among those.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This has little to do with language or array definition and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> references... It is more related to literature in general. In books, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is no page 0, no line 0 and no column 0....  All coordinates 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are (1,1) based..and when producing a listing reporting errors, it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should use also (1,1) coordinate for the common sense....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In computer science the majority of systems are 0-based. Although that 
</I>&gt;<i> stems from a time which is long in the past, it has carried over, so 
</I>&gt;<i> we simply have to deal with it. At least that's my opinion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> By the way... I think there is overusage of (0,0) based coordinate in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> computer language... In effect, array indices should always start at 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. It is an implementor's problem to adjust the indice by -1 to get 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an indexes... because the first element of a vector is located at the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> address 0... So to avoid this adjustment, computer language's 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> designer choose the easiest way for them (which is IMHO a bad side 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> side effect between the langage definitionand its implementation)!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, IMHO, Pascal, Cobol, LUA, Algol, PL/1 are all using the right 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> indices way...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't know that this helpful page existed:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly, the languages in major use today are favoring 0-based 
</I>&gt;<i> indices. And since I have to switch between 0 and 1-based languages 
</I>&gt;<i> very often, I'd wish Lua would just do away with the 1-based approach. 
</I>&gt;<i> It might be more &quot;intuitive&quot; if you read it as &quot;the first element of 
</I>&gt;<i> the array&quot; but I always think of a[n] as the &quot;element n places from 
</I>&gt;<i> the beginning&quot;, so that's &quot;intuitive&quot; for me. Call me rotten by C ;)

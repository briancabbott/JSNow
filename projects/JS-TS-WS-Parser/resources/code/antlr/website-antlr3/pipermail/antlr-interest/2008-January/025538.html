<PRE>Brilliant!  Thanks guys for your advice.

Jim's suggestion fixed the problem.

For some reason I was still getting an issue with Gavin's.  It was still 
thinking that 1350 was APAC_NUMERIC_TICKER.  I'm not too sure why and as 
Jim's works I've stopped investigating.

Thanks again to all those that got back.

</I>&gt;<i>      | INT                                {$setType(INT);}
</I>&gt;<i>      ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> protected
</I>&gt;<i> APAC_NUMERIC_TICKER
</I>&gt;<i>      : INT COMMA CHAR CHAR
</I>&gt;<i>      ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I suggest that combine the common elements though, which will minimize 
predicates (probably to none) and the protected calls:

NUMBER
:<i> INT
</I>    (
         COMMA (whatelse?)               { $setType(APAC_NUMERIC_TICKER);}
       | DOT INT                                                 { 
$setType(FLOAT); }
       | COLON INT            { $setType(RANGE); }
                  |                      { $setType(INT);   }
    )
|<i> DOT 
</I>    (
         INT                  { $setType(FLOAT); }
       |                      { $setType(DOT);   }
    )
;

Combine common roots basically, then branch accordingly. You can often 
avoid predicates this way.

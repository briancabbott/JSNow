&gt;<i> Wincent,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have used subversion branching and merging successfully. Can you  
</I>&gt;<i> please
</I>&gt;<i> explain what sucks about it?
</I>
Branching is simple and works (inexpensive copy) but merging is a  
total disaster. How do you cherry pick? How do you do repeated  
merges? Answer: you manually maintain a list of merged revisions in  
your commit log, and you very carefully avoid repeating the same  
merge twice. It is easy to forget, easy to make mistakes, cumbersome  
to use. Merging is painful enough that you think twice before doing  
forking off a branch in the first place, but it shouldn't be that way.

Subversion is a solid system but unless they hurry up and get their  
merge-tracking and more sophisticated merging functionality released  
and up to scratch quickly they will inevitably find themselves to be  
part of a dying breed. It is one of the last popular SCMs that still  
lacks decent merge support: all of the new distributed SCMs have  
literally manifold improvements in their merge subsystems... Git,  
SVK, Darcs, Mercurial, Bazaar, Codeville, you name it; there are  
literally dozens of them.

How often do you perform merges with Subversion? Once a day? A week?  
Month? However often you answer, I can guarantee you that you would  
do it more often if you used Git; merging is literally so quick and  
painless that you wind up creating short-lived topic branches for  
every new feature you add, every bug fix.

If you haven't seen it already, check out Linus' talk on Git that he  
gave at Google:

It should hopefully pique your interest enough to go and find out  
just why distributed version control is so darn good. Another good  
way to learn about distributed version control and how merging can/ 
should be is to learn about SVK, which like Git can easily be layered  
on top of an existing Subversion repository in order to give you a  
taste of what's possible.

These two articles are particularly good intros:

Cheers,
Wincent

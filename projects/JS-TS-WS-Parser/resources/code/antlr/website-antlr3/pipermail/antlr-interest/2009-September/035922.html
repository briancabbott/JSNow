<PRE>In order of their effect, here are the things you'll want to do to
improve speed. And when I say these are ordered, I mean there's a good
chance that changing a lower bullet point without changing the ones
above will have negligible results.

 

*         Left factor your grammar to remove the backtracking=true
option.

*         Remove semantic predicates (these show as {}? In the code).
Sometimes this will force you to build an ambiguous tree with a node
like &quot;SomethingOrSomethingElse&quot; that you can resolve in a tree walker
later by explicitly setting its type to &quot;Something&quot; or &quot;SomethingElse&quot;
once you determine the correct answer.

*         Make your syntactic predicates look as &quot;least ahead&quot; as
absolutely possible. Again, sometimes you can relax the rules of your
AST and resolve those in the tree walker later and greatly decrease the
lookahead requirement.

*         Use a &quot;flat&quot; expression parser like I sent to the list in the
past. The more operators your language has, the bigger difference it
will make.

Hi All , 

 

Pls let me know what are all the option that I could use , to get the
generated code with more performance. ( Need to be fast in parsing ). 

 

I have enabled &quot; backtracking = true &quot; , will this hits the performance
??? 

Without this option some ambiquity is coming. 

 

Pls help me in providing any better performace tuning option that I
could set for code generation. 

 

Thanx in advance

Bharath R

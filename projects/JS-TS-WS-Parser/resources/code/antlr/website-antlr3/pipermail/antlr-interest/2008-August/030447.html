<PRE>Yes, this is really a great challenge for me, but I'll try my best to figure 
it out.
Thank you very much.

No, there's not a limit like that. The only problems I've had are
codesize issues with Java, but that doesn't have anything to do with
backtracking, anyway.

Either the language is highly ambiguous or you have a mistake in your
grammar. SQL is not particularly nice as a language to parse...lots of
room for mistakes :(
Try to understand where it starts becoming ambiguous and you'll
eventually find it. Takes time and practice though.

:<i>) Ack I only referred to it because I had a lapse of memory with respect

after sending the mail I recalled it must have been lalr they used so it
was not a usefull suggestion, sorry about that :/

Quite often they are. Although with something like VHDL it will be hard to
see if they actually are. I recall it being a very big grammar (and spec)

&gt;<i> My current status is that I have a grammar without ANTLR warnings. To

</I>&gt;<i> language. Yes, you can call this cheating. :-)
</I>
Pfah that's only a matter of definitions ;)

&gt;<i> However, in real life, there are a number of features that are never
</I>&gt;<i> every practically used. In addition, my goal is mainly to process
</I>&gt;<i> synthesizable VHDL code (for the non-initiated: this is code that can
</I>&gt;<i> be compiled straight into electronic gates). Here the subset is even
</I>&gt;<i> smaller. I may look later at how to add the removed features back into
</I>&gt;<i> the grammar, but this isn't a high priority to be honest.
</I>
Sounds like an interesting project anycase :)

Cheers,

Ric

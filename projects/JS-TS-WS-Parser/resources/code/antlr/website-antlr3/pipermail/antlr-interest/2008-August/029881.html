There are lots of things which Ter intends to support in ANTLR and are 
missing in 3.0. But he can't work on all at once, which results in 
prioritisation of the features. As only Java has a need for this throws 
clause (which is ironic as Ter is the maintainer of the Java target :), 
it isn't a pressing matter. But Ter could do bug triaging a bit 
different for 3.2 - namely also taking into account how long a bug is in 
JIRA already.

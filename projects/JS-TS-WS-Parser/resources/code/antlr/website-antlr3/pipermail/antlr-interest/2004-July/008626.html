Well, as I've said many times, I'm no expert in compiler development.
The language I'm working with is Modelica (<A HREF="http://www.modelica.org,">http://www.modelica.org,</A>
which includes the language specification, i.e. grammar + semantics).

I'm trying to do some very specific things but protecting for others as
well.  The main goal of my work is in code metrics.  So I'm interested
in analyzing source code.  But Modelica is more of a declarative
language rather than an imperative or procedural language.  This is
important because Modelica involves an &quot;instantiation&quot; process (you
might also call it an elaboration process) which is the tricky part
(from my perspective).  There are a couple of papers on the Modelica
site from the most recent conference that discuss language tools
(including a paper I wrote about what I'm doing).

&gt;<i> Yeah, but that can get cumbersome at the object level with recursion
</I>&gt;<i> and alternatives.  It depends a great deal on the complexity of the
</I>&gt;<i> language.
</I>
Sure and I'm completely willing to accept that I'm just being stupid and
not recognizing the value of the tree parsers.  It's a bit of a learning
experience.  What I can say is that I have implemented a big chunk of
what I wanted and I never used a tree parser and I still don't see how
it would help.

&gt;<i> &gt; Think about it this way.  Imagine trying to program in Java or C++
</I>and
&gt;<i> &gt; not ever using the &quot;.&quot; (as in computer.drives[1].head.position) and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instead having to interrogate every object using only
</I>&quot;getFirstChild()&quot;
&gt;<i> &gt; and &quot;getNextSibling()&quot; and having only type and text information.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Imagine trying to express what I just typed? (i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; computer.drives[1].head.position) You get something like:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yikes!  Isn't &quot;computer.drives[1].position.head&quot; much simpler and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; statically checkable?
</I>
&gt;<i> Sure it is.  Tree grammars are appropriate for walking but not
</I>&gt;<i> searching.
</I>
And perhaps that is at the heart of this.  The elaboration process
involves working with one type definition and then constantly expanding
the branches of it.  There really isn't much &quot;searching&quot;.  There is some
work in determining the scope for different statements and stuff but
that is pretty simple (compared to the elaboration semantics).

&gt;<i> When you translate you typically walk the whole tree.
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes you index the tree with a symbol table.  But rarely do you
</I>&gt;<i> say 'give me the first term of the third expression in the for loop.'
</I>
In my current implementation, I find myself always wanting to grab a
specific subtree and having to search for it (analogous to what I
describe above).

Furthermore, I suspect part of the applicability of tree walking
involves what order you do things in.  At any given level in my tree I
start at that level, do several passes only at that level (and doing
different things) and then I recursively follow that procedure for each
child.  It seems like this juxtaposes the order that is more natural for
tree walkers which would be to do one task (e.g. scope resolution) for
the whole tree and then do another task for the whole tree.

You can read the instantiation process in the Modelica specification and
if you see a natural way to map it into a tree parser, let me know.
Keep in mind that the scoping rules in Modelica are a little difficult
from a compiler writer point of view (lots of non-fully qualified type
names to deal with).  Scoping also involves traversal of both the type
hierarchy and the &quot;instance hierarchy&quot; (the elaborated tree).

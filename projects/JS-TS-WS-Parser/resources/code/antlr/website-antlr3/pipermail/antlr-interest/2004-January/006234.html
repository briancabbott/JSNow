<PRE>Bitsets are a compact representation of a set of token numbers--exactly what
antlr needs to test for lookahead.  Setting the codeGenBitsetTestThreshold
tells antlr to switch from simple &quot;==&quot; tests to using bitsets when the
number of tokens to be tested is at or above the threshold.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Re: Parsing beginners question

I tried adding those options like so:
java -classpath %CLASSPATH% antlr.Tool -trace
-codeGenBitsetTestThreshold=999999 $(InputPath),
which I ran on the StdCParser.g file.

The only difference that I see is that I now have a bunch of Tracer
TraceInOut() calls in the .cpp file,
which I assume was due to the -trace flag.  What should the effect of the
999999 flag be,
and where should I see it?

Also, if you have a moment, could you tell me what the Bitset thing is all
about?
In going through source the StdCParser.cpp file last night I noticed several
_tokenSet_* arrays containing 
unsigned long quantities that I didn't understand.  Are these related to the
Bitset's you are referring to?

Thanks for your help!

Henry

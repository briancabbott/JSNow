This BASIC version mightn't be the best one to learn stuff on, it has lots 
of bad stuff in it:
  - Predefined language identifiers may also be used for variable names
  - EOL is sometimes whitespace and sometimes significant to the parser
  - ';' can also be used to terminate statements as well as used as a 
separator within statements
  - Somebody defined a ' ' operator(a single space character) which does 
formatting.
  - Both arrays and functions use '(...)' for arguments ie A(B) could be 
call function or dereference A at index B.
  - * is sometimes multiply, sometimes start comment
  - ! is sometimes OR operator, sometimes start comment
  - REM is sometimes a variable, sometimes REMainder function, sometimes 
start comment
  - Has a second kind of array which uses &lt; &gt; for indexes, &lt; &gt; are also 
conditional operators freely mixed together in expressions.
  - ':' has been used for labels(goto targets), as a concatenation operator 
as well as adding special meaning to certain other statements
  - .....plus lots other things that caused late nights which i cant 
remember offhand!

It might be better to start with something like tinybasic(by Sinan i think) 
in the examples directory and try to build that up, especially if you are 
used to C and not particularly comfortable with java/C++ or parser 
generators in general.

&gt;<i>Plus I'm going to have another stab at my C code. See if I get any further 
</I>&gt;<i>this time...

Rewrite the compiler/runtime to use C instead of java?

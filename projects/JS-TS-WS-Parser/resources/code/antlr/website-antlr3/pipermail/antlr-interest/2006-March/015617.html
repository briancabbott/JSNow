<PRE>A couple of questions, Andy...
 
Would it be fair to say that one big switch statement is not as good as an interface?
 
Does the tree grammar &quot;mix languages&quot; anywhere else besides actions and semantic preds? Would a solution that defines constraint and action languages be palatable to you? Or am I being too much of an &quot;Insightful Linguist&quot;?
 
Andy sez:
I realized that tree parsing is identical to text parsing, albeit in two dimensions instead of one. 

Go ahead and take an few minutes, a few hours, or a full PhD program to really absorb that. I'll wait right here.... 

Jeff sez:

LOL! I never got that either. To me, a tree seems multi-dimensional; a table is two-dimensional. Terrence??

Andy, your disenfranchisement lends credibility to the Tree Grammar.

Regards,

Jeff

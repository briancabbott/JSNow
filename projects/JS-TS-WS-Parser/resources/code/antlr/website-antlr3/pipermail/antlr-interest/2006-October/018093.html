Definition of The # Forms
--- --- ---

It means, &quot;a tree node with....&quot;.  The forms seen are:

   #[ ... ]    -- create a single node with the given type and text
   #( ... )    -- create a tree with the first argument as root and all
                  following arguments as children
                  &gt;&gt;&gt; NOTE THAT THE ARGUMENTS CAN BE LISTS &lt;&lt;&lt;
   #foo        -- reference the (possibly created) tree associated with the
                  (sub)production named &quot;foo&quot;
   ##          -- an alias for the (possibly created) tree associated with the
                  current production

--- --- ---
Some Examples
--- --- ---

&gt;<i> expressionList
</I>&gt;<i>     : expression (COMMA! expression)*
</I>&gt;<i>        { #expressionList = #(#[ELIST,&quot;ELIST&quot;], #expressionList); }
</I>&gt;<i>     ;
</I>
The last line means &quot;create a tree with root ELIST/&quot;ELIST&quot;, and use whatever
has been generated for #expressionList as the children.

--- --- ---

&gt;<i> expressionList
</I>&gt;<i>     : expression (COMMA! expression)*
</I>&gt;<i>        { ## = #(#[ELIST,&quot;ELIST&quot;], ##); }
</I>&gt;<i>     ;
</I>
This means exactly the same thing, but is more easily understood and less error
prone if you change the name of the production.

--- --- ---

&gt;<i> superClassClause!
</I>&gt;<i>     : ( &quot;extends&quot; id:identifier )?
</I>&gt;<i>        { ## = #(#[EXTENDS_CLAUSE,&quot;EXTENDS_CLAUSE&quot;],id); }
</I>&gt;<i>     ;
</I>
Here, ## (the tree for superClassClaus) is defined to be a simple AST with
EXTEND_CLAUSE as the root and the tree (list) returned by the production named
&quot;id&quot; as it's child or children.

Hope this helps,

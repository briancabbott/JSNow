I know that using character literals like this in the parser is 
tempting, but when you're starting out using ANTLR it can lead to 
just such confusing results.  I think it's best to avoid them 
entirely and just write explicit lexer rules.  Not only does this 
lead to less confusion, but you get to name the token types better 
:<i>)
</I>
First off, the reason why using &quot;WS&quot; in a parser rule doesn't work 
is that the WS rule emits its token on a hidden channel, so it's 
completely invisible to the parser -- it will simply never see a 
WS, so can't possibly match it.

Next, when you defined the 'space' rule: as this is a parser rule, 
and you're using quoted literals, *each* quoted string becomes a 
token in its own right.  In other words, this:

space : (' ' | '\t')+;

is basically equivalent to this:

T52 : ' ';
T53 : '\t';
space : (T52 | T53)+;

Now, if you combine this with the lexer rule WS, what you end up 
with is a lexer that says &quot;ok, if there's a single space, then 
it's a T52 and the parser can see it.  If there's more than one 
space, it's a WS and the parser can't see any of them.&quot;  Hopefully 
it's now obvious why you're getting the behaviour you're 
describing.  (The &quot;word&quot; and &quot;unit&quot; rules will cause similar 
problems.)

The way I usually prefer to approach parsing tasks is to first 
write a complete standalone lexer (and a set of unit tests to 
ensure it's producing the set of tokens I'm expecting).  Only when 
that is done do I write the parser rules that then interpret the 
resulting tokens.

Another potentially useful rule of thumb: for some inputs, 
whitespace truly is significant, and you *shouldn't* hide it.  For 
others, it's not, and you should.  In the latter case, sometimes 
you will have cases (eg. single-line comments) where the 
whitespace needs to be treated as significant in one specific 
area, but not globally; in these cases, you need to handle it all 
in the lexer, since the lexer can still see the whitespace but the 
parser cannot.

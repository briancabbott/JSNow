<PRE>Hi - I'm currently thinking about developing a scripting language 
for my employer - so I started initially with LEX / YACC.  However I 
have found the progress too difficult. I've never really done much 
work with this type of technology before, and I'm eager to learn 
it's ins and outs - I can think of loads of great uses for ANTLR, 
and can't wait to get cracking!!! 

As a c# developer I liked the idea of being able to generate the 
lexer code through ANTLR.

So anyway - Here's my plan

1. create all of the definitions for the language
2. Create a parser for it (running the scripting language isn;t 
required at this stage - it's for an embedded device that already 
exists)
3. use the samples I've found for DIY intellisense to provide a nice 
IDE by which users can type up their scripts(with predictive 
intellisense provided by the parser (or some other mechanism).

Here's what I was wandering : 
1. Is if feasable - can I generate the code to parse the text 
(either as typed in, or through reading a text file?)

2. Can I look ahead and see what could be typed (to generate the 
predictive text required) - or would I have to use the other files 
generated?

3. Can i just develop a parser independant of  a compiler?

I've just downloaded the latest version - I'm having problems 
running the first cut 'n' paste example.  I'm getting : 

ANTLR Parser Generator   Version 2.7.3   1989-2004 jGuru.com
error: Token stream error reading grammar(s):
t.g:17:1: unexpected char: 0x?F
t.g:16:9: rule classDef trapped:
t.g:16:9: unexpected token: '\n'
error: aborting grammar 'L' due to errors
Exiting due to errors.

any help / ideas would be appreciated - 

thanks

Mike Hingley

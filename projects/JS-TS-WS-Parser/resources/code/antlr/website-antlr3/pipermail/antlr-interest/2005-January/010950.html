	OK, if you knew, then you intentionally misquoted (for reasons
	that aren't clear).

&gt;<i> &gt; 	The lone standard such wrapper is auto_ptr&lt;T&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Boost has a number of such wrappers.
</I>
	I clearly said &quot;standard&quot;: Boost isn't part of ISO C++.

&gt;<i>     I also consider the std::string, std::list, std::vector to be RAII
</I>&gt;<i>     wappers.
</I>
	std::string is; std::list is, but only if T is an object that
	has a destructor.  If T is really MyObject*, then, although the
	list will be properly destroyed, all the MyObjects will be
	leaked.  Same with vector.

	In my own code, I've created variants of auto_ptr&lt;T&gt;, i.e.,
	various flavors of managed_ptr&lt;T&gt; that properly destroys the T
	object when the pointer to it gets destroyed.

	But I digress...

&gt;<i>     My mistake. I'll go back to saying, for C++, forget about it.
</I>
	And, IMHO, it's not such a bad thing.  A C++ programmer would
	never want to have a &quot;finally&quot; block in ANTLR anyway because a
	C++ programmer doesn't think about &quot;finally&quot; blocks at all
	since C++ doesn't have them.

	But a Java programmer wants/expects a &quot;finally&quot; block in ANTLR
	because Java has them.

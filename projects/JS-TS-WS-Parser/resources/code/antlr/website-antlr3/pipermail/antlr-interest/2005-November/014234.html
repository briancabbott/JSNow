Hi.  Yes, that does seem to say there is a bug.  Note that I cannot  
reproduce this bug.  I added an empty alt and I still get correct code.

class T extends Parser;

x : A|C|D|E|F|G|H;

s : a b ;

// here is the rule of interest
a : B
    | {p1}? ( )
    | {p2}? ( )
    |
    ;

b : A|D|F|G|H;

For rule a() I generate the decision:

             if ((LA(1)==B)) {
                 match(B);
             }
             else if (((_tokenSet_1.member(LA(1))))&amp;&amp;(p1)) {
                 {
                 }
             }
             else if (((_tokenSet_1.member(LA(1))))&amp;&amp;(p2)) {
                 {
                 }
             }
             else if ((_tokenSet_1.member(LA(1)))) {
             }

Unless you can send me a small piece of code that breaks, I may not  
be able to track it down in a reasonable amount of time, which means  
it won't get solved.

I'm hoping that is because it's not bitten that many people.

Wow.  You're pretty demanding for somebody using my free software.   
once you give me a small test that breaks, quoting you, &quot;I will [work  
on it] as soon as time on my project permits it.&quot;

&gt;<i> I used several months to hunt down errors in my grammar, when it all

I'm not sure how it took you several months to look at the single IF  
statement and its bitset to figure out it was missing any lookahead.   
Surely a 0 bitset is obvious.

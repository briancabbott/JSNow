<PRE>Hi,
I am working on a small textual DSL which is kind of a small subset of Java in the sense it has only relational, conditional, arithmetic operations which are very much like those in Java.
I have just learnt the basics of ANTLR (skimmed thru the definitive guide. It's brilliant!!!) and wrote the basic grammar for the language. (Copied most of it from Java.g ;-))

I need to provide content assist for the editor which is one of the major reasons I decided to give ANTLR a try (we already had grammar defined in JavaCC and simple editor based on it) .I am looking up to the ANTLR generated parser for helping me with this.
Has anybody developed content assist (autocompletion) based on ANTLR? How easy or difficult would it be? Would I need to do too much tweaking with ANTLR to get this working?

I saw the FAQ entry &quot;How to get the list of valid options for next&quot; but couldn't make out much from it :-(. How do I get the string token or rule represented by the bitset that I get on accessing the follow stack?

How do I proceed with this?
Even a clue or pointers would certainly help.

Regards,
-Arjun.

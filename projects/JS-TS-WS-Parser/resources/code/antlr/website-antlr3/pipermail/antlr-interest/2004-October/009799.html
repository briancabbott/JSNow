Hello,

antlr's 2.7.4 documentation states: 

&quot;Syntactic  predicates  are a form of selective back-
tracking and, therefore, actions are turned off while
evaluating a  syntactic  predicate so that actions do 
not have to be undone.&quot; 

1st issue:

Having a look into generated code I can see that actions
to create tree nodes are still done while &quot;guessing&quot;. Is
there a specific reason for creating them?

2nd (more important) issue:

Assume  one   of  my actions is to switch to a different
lexer  (as in the javadoc example).  This  lexer  switch 
would then  not  be  executed and consequently &quot;guessing&quot;
would fail, right?

Perhaps I miss the point but shouldn't there be something
that let me tell antlr to executed this action regardless
of guessing or not?

Here's a proposal:

JAVADOC_OPEN
    :    &quot;/**&quot; {! selector.push(&quot;doclexer&quot;); }  ;
================^

The operator  &quot;{!&quot; shall indicate execution of action in
any case (the action is assumed to be &quot;idempotent&quot;).


But perhaps I missed the point. Is there another way of
doing this?

Wolfgang.

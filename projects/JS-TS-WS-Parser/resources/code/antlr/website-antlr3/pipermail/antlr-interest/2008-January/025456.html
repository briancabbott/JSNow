<PRE>Hi -

At minimum, I would require that there are two solutions for many (? - a few
important) of the examples. In the real world, there is not &quot;the solution.&quot;
(and of course, not both/more solutions need to be done down to code ... but
there should - like in any good patterns book - be enough meat so that the
problems are made clear when solving one over the other solution; I'm very
convinced that there is never ever a &quot;perfect solution&quot; in your business).

Just to lay out that &quot;design space&quot; a little: Whether you 

* do your work in the parser;
* create an AST and do your work there;
* create an AST, rewrite in to another AT, do your work there;
* create a complete different structure (e.g. a flow graph [think &quot;byte
code&quot;]) to do your work; 
* create an AST, the create the different structure and do your work there;

depends very much 

* on your current needs (&quot;semantics&quot;) (are there &quot;tree jumping semantics&quot; =
work on some distant, even upcoming subtree; &quot;flow jumping semantics&quot; = do
something in the middle of some distant, even umpcoming tree; &quot;simple
semantics&quot; = work recursively down/up the AST);
* on future needs (are you going to add additional semantics to the tree -
optimizations [think constant folding], documentation [think Javadoc], ...)

Before I ever start laying out a grammar, I write down this design space for
a tool - which sometimes results in creating an AST at a time where this
seems &quot;way to complicated&quot; - but I know it will help with that &quot;tiny
language extension&quot; they are already talking about ... or the opposite:
Seeing that a generalization (even a small one) requires much work, I reduce
the machine to a &quot;small one&quot; (and will bill the customer for the large one
when he really claims to need it ...).

Second, there should probably be advice on when/where to stop using ANTLR.
The two &quot;boundaries&quot; that right now come to mind are
* XML - you can do something with ANTLR here (see a few great Wiki entries),
but of course there are lots of XML-specific technologies;
* rewriting - when a rewriting solution is going to become a &quot;calculus,&quot;
other tools (one was mentioned here a few days ago ...) might be a better
choice - but why?

.... just my two cents (also why I find today's wiki entries somewhat ad-hoc
...).

Regards
Harald

</I>&gt;<i> outline feedback
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Howdy folks,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've signed up to do another book for pragmatic programmers.  
</I>&gt;<i> This time I'm going to do a collection of &quot;how to&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> examples/recipes.  The book is meant to teach you how to fish 
</I>&gt;<i> not give you fish--the examples will be necessarily smallish. 
</I>&gt;<i> I anticipate the level being introductory through 
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate as real, big examples will simply not fit. I'd 
</I>&gt;<i> like to start out with really brain-dead examples such as  
</I>&gt;<i> comma separated value parsing so that I can explain the 
</I>&gt;<i> fundamentals.   
</I>&gt;<i> I will always remember the first technical book I read (on 
</I>&gt;<i> 6502 assembly code code by Lance Levanthal).  This awesome 
</I>&gt;<i> book started out showing how to clear a memory location. This 
</I>&gt;<i> gave me the confidence that I might actually understand the 
</I>&gt;<i> rest of the book :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I propose breaking the book up into three main sections: 
</I>&gt;<i> parsing, interpretation, translation. I would love to hear 
</I>&gt;<i> peoples feedback about what examples would be useful and 
</I>&gt;<i> exciting.  Keep in mind that the average example will need to 
</I>&gt;<i> fit in about 5 to 10 pages. Code samples will be made 
</I>&gt;<i> available online and not necessarily completely printed out 
</I>&gt;<i> in the book to save space. Also I would love to hear your 
</I>&gt;<i> feedback about how the recipes should be laid out or described.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please CC Susannah Pfalzer, with whom I'm fortunate to work 
</I>&gt;<i> with again, on your replies as she is not a member of this list. :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is my rough draft list of examples, which is a bit too few.   
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks and happy new year!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ter
</I>&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;<i> I. Parsing recipes
</I>&gt;<i> 	comma-separated values (show in java then python or 
</I>&gt;<i> ruby then ANTLR)
</I>&gt;<i> 	parsing binary data (fixed and non-fixed size records)
</I>&gt;<i> 	parsing log files (in awk/sed/grep then ANTLR)
</I>&gt;<i> 	configuration file or JSON or YAML
</I>&gt;<i> 	text-based network protocol (e.g., POP, nntp, http)
</I>&gt;<i> 	graphs and networks via edge list format
</I>&gt;<i> 	read fixed a XML format like:
</I>&gt;<i> 		SVG (vector graphics)
</I>&gt;<i> 		or, RDF ontology graph
</I>&gt;<i> 	handling include files
</I>&gt;<i> 	parsing island grammars like JSP
</I>&gt;<i> 	simplified English imperative statement recognizer
</I>&gt;<i> 		(E.g., games: &quot;pick up gun and shoot spy&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> II. Interpretation recipes
</I>&gt;<i> 	arithmetic expression trees
</I>&gt;<i> 	polynomial differentiation
</I>&gt;<i> 	query language (parse and pull data from DB)
</I>&gt;<i> 	serial/deserialize objects
</I>&gt;<i> 	partial PS interpreter
</I>&gt;<i> 	simple programming language interpreter
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> III. Translation recipes
</I>&gt;<i> 	wiki to HTML
</I>&gt;<i> 	simplified programming language pretty printer
</I>&gt;<i> 	instrumenting simplified programming language with 
</I>&gt;<i> profiling info
</I>&gt;<i> 	simple Java byte code generator
</I>&gt;<i> 	simple robot control language for lego MindStorm robots
</I>&gt;<i> 	class hierarchy generator (awk/sed/grep then grep+ANTLR)
</I>&gt;<i> 		generates DOT format for graphviz to visualize
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

<PRE>First of all thanks for the code sample.
This is a help, although I need to figure out where to put it, and how to call.

As per your and Jim's comment that my question was not clear,
I will try to clarify it now. 

(As to Jim's comment that I don't know what I'm doing. 
Well.... If I did I would not be asking for help.)

On page 132 of Ter's book (pdf version) 

When a rule matches elements repeatedly, translators commonly need
to build a list of these elements. As a convenience, ANTLR provides the
+= label operator that automatically adds all associated elements to an New in v3.
ArrayList, whereas the = label operator always refers to the last element
matched. The following variation of rule decl captures all identifiers into
a list called ids for use by actions:

decl: type ids+=ID (',' ids+=ID)* ';' ; // ids is list of ID tokens

my rule is a little different (and simplitied)

type_name 
    : name+=ID+ (LPAREN size1=signed_number (COMMA size2=signed_number)? RPAREN)?
      {
		
      }
    ;


The key point here being name += ID+

The relevant generated code looks like:


            	        // /home/jeffn/Development/antlr/trunk/edu/sqliteGui/SQLite.g:207:11: name+= ID
            	        {
            	            name = (pANTLR3_COMMON_TOKEN) MATCHT(ID, &amp;FOLLOW_ID_in_type_name1275); 
            	            if  (HASEXCEPTION())
            	            {
            	                goto ruletype_nameEx;
            	            }

            	            if (list_name == NULL)
            	            {
            	                list_name=ctx-&gt;vectors-&gt;newVector(ctx-&gt;vectors);                     &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;------- Key point.
            	            }
            	            list_name-&gt;add(list_name, name, NULL);

            	        }

The key point here, in the line below (and marked above). is the ctx-&gt;vectors.

 list_name=ctx-&gt;vectors-&gt;newVector(ctx-&gt;vectors)


There is no &quot;vectors&quot; element in the ctx structure.

SO, MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION ARE:  
HOW DO I PROPERLY ADD THE vectors ELEMENT TO THE THE ctx STRUCTURE?
HOW TO I INIT THE ctx -&gt;vectors TO POINT TO MY NEWLY MINTED vectors function.
AND HOW TO USE IT IN SUBSEQUENT RULES.
(Or more precisely in my case. Since I can simply build a string and pass it back to the calling rule.
  How do I access the vector's element (eg the individual string of the compound type name (ie var char)
  to build a composite (concatenated) string.)

--------

One of my questions is why did the code generator generate code for functions it did not create?

--------

Some things that I have tried.

I have looked and read, and reread the documentation.
I have grepped and prayed over the example code and grammars.
I have searched the email archives and tried to find some info in the wiki.
I have googled everything I can think of.
All to no avail.

I noticed a lot of chatter about code hoisting and C# and global init. 
But I have to admit  I'm enough of a language guy to intricacies, nuances, and 
inter-language complications that I read about. 

I created a rule;

vectors: ;

This indeed put a vectors element in the ctx structure
(I thought I was home free, all I would have to do was initialize with the newly minted vectors function that Stanley gave me.)

So I added an
@members {
	myVectors() {}
}

@init {
 ctx-&gt;vectors = myVectorr;
}

And I found that the generated code did indeed contain the myVectors routine.
And nothing was generated to update the ctx-&gt;vectors element.

Clearly the my idea of an @init outside of a rule being executed was wrong.

So, now I am back asking for more help.
I hope this is more clear.

Thanks in advance (or should I say part way through)

Jeffrey

If I arrive at a moderately useful parser or set of parsers, I would 
consider making it open source.  The question becomes: would enough 
people be interested in it to make it worth the effort to publish it?

My goal is to do some automated code metrics on ColdFusion code.  
That means being able to recognize the use of session, request and 
client scope variables, measuring the level of indirection in 
controlling the flow of execution, measuring the degree of coupling 
between templates, and other measures of complexity.  Because of the 
nature of the language, it means parsing ColdFusion tags, ColdFusion 
script, HTML tags, and JavaScript all entangled in the source files.

There is also a methodology for coding applications called FuseBox 
(somewhat analogous to Java struts) that if done badly, results in 
horribly obfuscated code.  Unfortunately from what I've seen so far 
in our company, it seems to be done badly more often than not.  I'm 
hoping to come up with a code analyzer that can point out the 
features that result in hard-to-read and hard-to-maintain code.

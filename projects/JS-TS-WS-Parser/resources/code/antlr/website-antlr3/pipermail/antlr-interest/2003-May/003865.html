<PRE>What is it non-deterministic with? In other words, what other construct
recognised by the lexer could a PATTERN be confused with?

You will have to define an unquoted pattern as a subset of that other
construct, and then use $settype to change the type to PATTERN if that's
what you've got.

Cheers,
Wol

Thank you for the suggestion.

The main issue that I am running into with this is that a PATTERN 
token can appear either inside or outside of quotes - so I won't 
recognize a PATTERN outside of quotes. When I try and define it 
without quotes, I have lexical nondeterminism

PATTERN : QUOTE (ALLOWCHARS)+ QUOTE ;

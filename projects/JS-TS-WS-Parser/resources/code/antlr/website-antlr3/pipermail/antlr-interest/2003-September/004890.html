<PRE>I like the expression parsers and the tree parsers a lot, but this lexer
implementation is bogus, in my opinion. Maybe the wizards out there can
direct me to the simple solution for what I believe should be a simple problem. If not, next time I will using another lexer with antlr, or 
if none is available, use another parser generator totally. That would
be unfortunate, because there is a lot to like here.

BUT THE LEXER!!!

I have spend more hours spinning, trying to find ways around this lexer
to solve what would be simple cases in flex. It's just not worth it!

The latest example:
I sometimes need to scan ahead through the input and once I've
determined the context or whatever, push back what I've scanned onto the input stream. I DON'T NEED to push back everything but the first character!
Which seems to be the consume() default. 

How is this consume default changed? Example please!

Here is the specific situation:
END
    : (&quot;End&quot; LINE_TERMINATOR) =&gt; ENDEXIT
    | (&quot;End&quot; (' ' | '\t')+) =&gt; ENDCHECK
    ;

In the case that &quot;End&quot; followed by the above stuff is not recognized
(e.g. the string 'EndTest') the lexer consumes the 'E' and I'm left with
'ndTest'. Note my ENDCHECK and ENDEXIT are protected. 

I also don't like
the hoisting of rules in nextToken based on left hand side semantic predicates; the effects are unpredictable and overly complex. The ordering
of matching rules is overly complex and thus unpredictable as well. 

thanks for any help you can give.

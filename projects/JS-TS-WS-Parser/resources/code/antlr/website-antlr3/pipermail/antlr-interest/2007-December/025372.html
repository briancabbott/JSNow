Obviously you shouldn't do that, and if you've got something where 
that's a possibility, it means that you're probably doing the 
wrong thing in your parser actions.

When you've got a case where the input may be invalid (which is 
most of the time), you should ensure that your parser actions 
don't have side-effects -- they should merely record state (eg. 
similar to building an AST, but a bit less formal) or queue up 
tasks that need to be performed without actually taking any 
action.  Then your main program actions it all only if it managed 
to complete the parse without errors.  (It might be a good idea to 
change to actually build an AST in your parser.)

And incidentally, I'm not sure that was the best example -- SQL is 
a particularly unforgiving language (oops, I just accidentally 
pressed ENTER after typing &quot;DELETE FROM Paychecks&quot;; I was going to 
enter a WHERE clause, honest!).

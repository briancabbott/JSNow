<PRE>Hi,

I'd really appreciate some help about a strange problem I have been facing
for a few days now, and I will try to be as clear as possible about it.

I am working with Antlr 2.7.7. Last week, I had some NullPointer exception
when executing my file parser after adding a new rule to my grammar. When
trying to debug it (into Eclipse 3.2), the debugger was kind of &quot;lost&quot; in
the Parser.java file (the announced line was not the good one, step by step
debugging missed some lines, ...). I thought I had reached some limit there,
concerning either Antlr or Eclipse.

That's why I tried with a new version of Eclipse (3.4). After importing the
project, it worked for several days, until the day before yesterday.
Yesterday morning, same problem : NullPointers when trying to parse files
and debugger lost in lines...

I transferred my work on a colleague's computer (running Eclipse 3.3) and I
worked perfectly all the day of yesterday.

But this morning, same problem... I am turning mad !

Would you have any idea about the possible origin of this problem ? I am
stuck...

Thanks in advance...

Julien

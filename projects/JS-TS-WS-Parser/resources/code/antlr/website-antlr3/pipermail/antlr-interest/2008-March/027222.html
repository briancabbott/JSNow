<PRE>On the other hand, you could just spend
about half an hour downloading ANTLR, running it on
java.g, and using JavaEmitter.java to print the AST.

You could then start modifying JavaEmitter to produce
actionscript, and never have to learn any ANTLR or StringTemplate
at all, and know nothing about lexing and parsing. All the information
you'll ever need is there, in the AST that you're printing.

You'll have a lot of work just in really understanding what the
AST looks like and how to map Java code to actionscript. Having to
learn a lot about ANTLR at the same time makes it much more difficult.

IIRC, this is what the Java-to-Python guy did, and the approach
worked out fine.

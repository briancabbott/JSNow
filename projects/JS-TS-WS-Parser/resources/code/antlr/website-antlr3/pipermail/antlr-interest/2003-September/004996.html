'.' is a wild card and just matches one node but does not decend into the
tree, just like ID above does not descend into a tree and just matches one
node of type ID.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Skipping AST nodes in tree-parsing


Hello there.. 

Is there a way in a treeparser to skip the walking/parsing of a tree node? I
want to store a reference to the AST instead. Two examples: 

This is in my parser: 

funcdef
  : &quot;function&quot;^ ID LPAREN! arg_list RPAREN! block_stmt
  ;

and in the tree parser: 
funcdef
  : #(&quot;function&quot; ID arg_list block_stmt)
  ;

Now, instead of parsing ID, arg_list and then block_stmt nodes, I only want
to parse the ID and arg_list and skip over block_stmt, instead I will store
a reference to the node in a hashtable indexed on the given ID. 

Later, when the function is called in the user-program, the tree-parser rule
for a function call will look up the AST for the function definition by its
name and manually call appropriate rule for walkin the AST, after installing
the given paremeters into the symbol table. 

Another example of this is rewriting for loops to while loops: 

for (stmt1; expr; stmt2) stmt3; 

becomes 

stmt1; while (expr) { stmt3; stmt2; } 

This involves the reordering of the atoms, i.e. this translation scheme is
not simple by the definiton of the Dragonbook. 

How does one do this kind of translation in a tree walker? Perhaps someone
could point out a simpler solution, but if one could skip over nodes as
described above and manually call the parsing method for them at a later
time, this becomes trivial. 

Arnar

Couldn't you fiddle with the indices into the buffer? Aah no you  
can't. Blimey. This really is a problem of non-contiguous ranges, is  
it not?
If the tokens/text to ignore is always at the start or end of the  
current token it's easy, but once you get one of those in the middle  
you are
SOL. So I guess it's either storing ranges or coming up with some  
really clever idea ;)
Of course, you could argue that the storing of indices is really an  
implementation detail of the CommonToken class and it could copy the
token text if need be without having to tell anyone (i.e. the user).  
One possibility would be to copy the text if you use the not-include- 
this-tokens-text
feature.
OTOH, using ranges shouldn't that much of a problem either. It just  
makes the actual returning of the text a bit more complicated. That's  
probably
still a lot cheaper than to copy it.

&gt;&gt;<i> Also, is there a way to get back the behavior of EA7 when it comes

</I>&gt;<i> I think it's toDebugString or something...
</I>
aah now I see it. The new version does .getText() on each token. ea7  
was doing toString() on them. Ok, just gotta do it manually
then. No trouble.

Thanks,
Kay

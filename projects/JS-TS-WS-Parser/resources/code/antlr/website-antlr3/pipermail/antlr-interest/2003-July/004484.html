<PRE>Hi,

I was more referencing to the cost of creating/deleting objects for
the construction of the AST. Anything not going through memory management
routines is a win.

Well in java it will be/is expensive as well (as someone pointed out
recently) AFAIK exception handling is expensive no matter how smart it is
implemented. Not sure how java will compare to C++ on this, will be mostly
implementation dependent. 

Actually the use of exceptions was the only thing I didn't really like
about antlr when switching to it from the cocktail toolbox. If we mimick
the codegen of cocktails ell LL(1) parser generator then we don't need to
use exceptions (other than for real parse errors).

&gt;<i> It will still be awhile.  I'm hoping that this will end up as an open

</I>
Looking at the past one 'gatekeeper' might not be enough. I agree that
having a set bunch of people guard the consistency/quality of the code is a
good idea (tm).

&gt;<i> Ter's still wrestling with the dilemma of &quot;I want to write it myself so
</I>&gt;<i> that ANTLR does not become a gawdawful mess&quot; versus &quot;I really don't have
</I>&gt;<i> the time&quot;.  That's not an easy decision to make.
</I>
Sure isn't :/

&gt;<i> If we do go the open development route, we might see something by the
</I>&gt;<i> middle of next year or earlier.
</I>
End of next year then ;)

How about grammar inheritance btw ?

Cheers,

Ric

It's less broken than it was ;)

I agree with that. For now I'll add a warning message, which is indeed
something I missed when working on this stuff, I missed one spot. Although
with the current internals it will not be ideal still. (This whole
heterogeneous AST stuff is inside one of the worst parts of the C++
codegen)

&gt;<i> One more comment:

</I>
Well the clone you won't get around whichever way you choose, if you only
got a baseclass pointer and you need to duplicate a node then you need a
clone() or something similar. The old implementation would merrily convert
all heterogeneous ast's to CommonAST's when using the supplied tree
duplication functions. The factory static method was already a requirement
for the old versions of antlr for custom AST's. So anyone mirroring the
antlr classes would already have them.

The 'super' factory is new but it's only a few lines of extra code in
initialization of a parser setup. Yes, a default would have been possible.
But then we'll have to see how many people don't read the documentation and
merrily have disjunct (and out of sync) factories in parsers,
treetransformers and treeparsers, with as result that they shoot themselves
in the foot. Now people have to initialize a few things more and it crashes
if you don't, e.g. clear behaviour. For people who read the docs things
will be ok. For the people who don't well....

Cheers,

Ric

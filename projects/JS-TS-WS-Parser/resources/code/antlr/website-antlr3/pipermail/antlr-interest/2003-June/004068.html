<PRE>Hi,

Finally I got some time to resync on my mailbox and do some antlr stuff.

The result of this can be found at this link:

<A HREF="http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/antlr/antlr-20030605.tar.gz">http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/antlr/antlr-20030605.tar.gz</A>

This snapshot is cut from the current maintrunk.

- Fixes to configure/Makefile build I hope it now works out of the box. And
  behaves the same as Terence's build scripts (e.g. only one antlr.jar)
- I included/merged a number of MSVC fixes (mainly the ones from Alexander
  Lenski kudos to him for supplying this stuff, also thanks to Thomas
  Dudziak and other supplying patches)
  - Fixed ANTLR_API stuff in config.h
  - Put ANTLR_API on generated classes and structs.
  - I hope it now builds ok on MSVC 7.0
  - I expect better behaviour on MSVC 6.0 but no guarantees. Might still need
    Thomas' STLPort solution.

Please follow MSVC instructions in lib/cpp/README. In short for a non dll
build add all the lib/cpp/src/*.cpp (except dll.cpp) files and put lib/cpp
in the include path of the compiler. (Do *not* use the stuff from the
contrib dir its outdated)

I did not yet compile a list of bugfixes since 2.7.2 release. But I'm
pretty sure all trivial fixes are in.

I'd appreciate all the feedback form MSVC users. (Keep in mind that I don't
have access to these compilers and cannot test this stuff)

I do not exactly know how long I will have time but I hope we can get a
fixup release out. I might try making the stuff Cygwin or Mingw friendly.

As with all development snapshots YMMV, it may blow up in your face, no
guarantees.

Cheers,

Ric

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think that some clear example of this construction is needed. Let me
reiterate.
Consider following constructs (as parser sees them):

(1) super

(2) super [TYPE] method

(3) [TYPE] method

(1) calls direct super method, (2) calls method on some parent determined by
TYPE, (3) calls static method on arbitrary type
Upon seeing (2) parser cannot decide whether what it sees is really (2) or
rather (1) followed by (3). So I can use syntactic predicate binding [TYPE]
to the nearest 'super' construct, if present. Simply: ( super '[' ) =&gt;
super_alternative. But user might have really typed :

super; [TYPE] method

, which parser did not see because of ';' optionality.
But this problem, in my opinion, is simply solved by saying somehow: see all
semicolons in this predicate - and that was my original question's subject.
If parser saw semicolons when executing predicates then it could not match (
super '[' ) so it would fail, and it in turn would lead to taking correct
path. I hope my reasoning is more or less clear to you. Thanks for any
input.

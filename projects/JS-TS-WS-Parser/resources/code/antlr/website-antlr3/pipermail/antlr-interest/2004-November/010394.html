Hi,

We've been using ANTLR very successfully for over a year and love 
it. We generate C++ code from the grammars and have 4 parsers being 
used by 4 different threads.

Recently we've been experiencing a problem that we've not yet been 
able to solve. The system crashes randomly. We tried everything we 
can think of to no avail. The wierd thing is that it somehow always 
crashes in the parser (and only in one of them) although the code 
for using the 4 different parsers is the same. When it does crash it 
is because LA (called from nextToken()) has instead of 1 or 2 a 
value like 15 Million - obviously garbage due to some memory leak or 
misuse.

I know this is not specifically in the parser (or more specifically -
 we are not balmin the parser) but does anyone have any suggestions 
or previous such experiences (that were hopefully resolved)?

Thanks,
-Ron

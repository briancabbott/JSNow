</I>These are test for bugs that were once fixed, but are no longer valid 
tests, but for which Ter has not had time to go and either decide to 
delete the test or make the test different. For instance tests for 
NFA-DFA conversions that no longer convert to the thing that the the 
teste is looking for. sometimes just things like A B C is now A C B 
(validly) I don't want to disable the tests or we will forget to do 
anything about them. There are better mechanisms but they take time to 
set up.

Also, don't forget that in a perfect world all releases would be without 
bugs, but it isn't a perfect world, even if you get paid to do such 
things as this :-)

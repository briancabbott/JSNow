<PRE>Hi Stephen,

Can you post the exact compiler error? I also run my grammar in
NetBeans 6.9.1, generated from antlrworks 1.4, but don't have any such
problems. My generated parser is a bit smaller than yours though
(about 8k lines), although it isn't immediately obvious to me why that
would matter.

</I>&gt;<i> I have a composite grammar which generates AST trees. I can run and debug the grammar from AntlrWorks 1.4 without any problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, my grammar is part of a larger project, which I am developing with NetBeans 6.9.1 and Maven, using the antlr3-maven-plugin. When I try to build my project, the grammar file gets translated into Java alright, but the resultant Java parser file causes a &quot;code too large&quot; error.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand why AntlrWorks can compile the grammar but NetBeans cannot. Can anyone enlighten me? The generated parser file is 13756 lines long and the &quot;code too large&quot; error under NetBeans appears on line 7204, so there seems to be a fundamental difference in what NetBeans/Maven and AntlrWorks are doing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have tried to split the grammar into smaller bits to work round this problem. I took some parser rules and put them into a different parser grammar, which I imported into the main one. However, nearly all my parser rules include &quot;-&gt; ^( ... )&quot; to generate AST stuff. Antlr complains when it sees a &quot;^(&quot; in the imported file. I have included &quot;output=AST;&quot; in the options for the imported file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> None of the examples of composite grammars that I have been able to find in the net deal with AST output from the imported file. Is there some trick I should be aware of?

<PRE>Hi,
We are using the ANTLR parser generator in our project. We are facing 
the following problem while running the 2.7.2 and 2.7.4rc1 versions 
of ANTLR.

Debug Problem - 
                 We are using VS .NET 2002 to test the C# parser 
files generated from ANTLR. The output of both the DEBUG and RELEASE 
modes fail to parse the input and gives an error like ...

&quot;Build Tree Error : expecting &quot;&quot; found '(' &quot;

This error is not meaningful both in terms of the grammar for which 
the parser was built and in terms of the validity of the input.
The crazy thing is yet to come ... what we mean is, when breakpoints 
are set at each method definition of the generated code of the parser 
file, and when we start debugging in VS .NET 2002, stepping over each 
breakpoint encounterd ... bingo!!! ... the parsing is a success and 
the desired output(AST) is generated. This sure seems lame ... but we 
tried it on different systems and also on VS .NET 2003 ... the 
problem persists. To give you an idea of the problem on hand, we even 
created a small tool to fire the &quot;F10&quot; key to the VS .NET IDE to save 
ourselves the trouble of pressing the &quot;F10&quot; key many times.

We haven't used NANT ... but just wondering if it addresses the 
problem on hand.

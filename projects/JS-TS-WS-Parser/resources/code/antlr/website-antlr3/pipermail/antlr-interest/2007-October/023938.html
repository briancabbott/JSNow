You can write your own version of the various streams that consume
characters, tokens on demand in contrast to the current implementation. I
could offer you an implementation of a token stream in Python - this has
been raised before, you may find more pointers in the list archives or the
wiki.

The second point is about discarding old tokens. It should be possible to
call a method from the parser at the end of a 'record', which instructs the
token stream to flush all consumed tokens - that should be pretty save and
straight forward. You may even flush the tokens from the token stream's
buffer on consume(), but there may be circumtances when a negative
lookahead is needed - can't tell of the head...

Well, that's the generic approach and if you can come up with a solution,
feel free to post it to the wiki ;)

It could be much easier, if you can easily split the input into records
(e.g. if record == line) and then feed one record into the parser at a time
and reset it afterwards.

<PRE>The problem is the decision inside rule r. Since ANTLR uses lookahead only
(as opposed to lookbehind), the decision making doesn't know which instance
of r is being parsed. The following would resolve the issue:

s : X r1 A B
   | Y r2 B
   ;

r1 : A | ;
r2 : A | ;

Subject: [antlr-interest] SLL(2) in &quot;The Definitive ANTLR Reference&quot;

I was reading about the following grammar on page 287 of the PDF document

grammar t;
s : X r A B
  | Y r B
  ;

r : A
  |
  ;

I don't see where the problem is since the alternatives in s begin with two
different tokens X and Y.  I think that since these two tokens are different
I can easily construct a DFA that would unambiguously parse a stream of
tokens.

I sense that this example was supposed to bring out a finer point about how
ANTLR generates parsers but I'm afraid that it is being lost on me.


Regards,
Alan

Worse!  The tree parsing is poorly implemented ;)  Well, to be fair,  
it has some annoying bugs and some bizarre inconsistencies that nail  
even me.  Sorry if you're having trouble.

Well, if you're used to building your own trees with yacc, you can  
just do that with antlr so you feel at home. :)

Have you seen my course notes?  Sometimes they help.

Also note that the 3.0 version will have all that tree stuff cleaned  
up and documented (hopefully in a nice book).

</I>&gt;<i> The grammar (a high-level, abstract specification) is ambiguous.
</I>&gt;<i> The parser conflict (a low-level, implementation decision) is not ambiguous.
</I>&gt;<i> Recall that parser generators, in the general case, know only about
</I>&gt;<i> conflicts in building their tables, not grammar ambiguities (as we all
</I>&gt;<i> know by heart, no program can detect ambiguous grammars in the general
</I>&gt;<i> case). In the grammar I supplied, all parser generators are warning
</I>&gt;<i> about conflicts in building their tables; one should not assume those
</I>&gt;<i> conflicts correspond to different alternatives of the grammar
</I>&gt;<i> ambiguity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really can be parsed, in general, as either
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not by an LL(1) parser with that grammar as input.
</I>&gt;<i> Not by an LALR(1) parser with that grammar as input.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More importantly, that is NOT what ANTLR or any other parser generator
</I>&gt;<i> is warning about when trying to process this grammar, and overriding
</I>&gt;<i> the default choice of ANTLR or any other parser generator will give
</I>&gt;<i> you a BROKEN PARSER, not one that selects an alternative
</I>&gt;<i> interpretation of the (in this case, happens to be) ambiguous grammar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What you are correct in pointing out is that only hard and fast rule
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that makes sense
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This really sounds like you don't understand that overriding the
</I>&gt;<i> choice the parser generator is complaining about produces a BROKEN
</I>&gt;<i> parser.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> imagine a parser that did not implement a hard and fast rule and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instead generated both parse trees and allowed the client to decide
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which it liked best (and indeed there are parser generators that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behave that way, e.g., SGLR [1]).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, ANTLR is not complaining that the grammar is ambiguous. It is
</I>&gt;<i> complaining about a conflict between two choices. One of which utterly
</I>&gt;<i> fails to produce a parser that recognizes the input grammar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It really is best to avoid these kinds of ambiguities and to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understand them if they exist in your grammar. Issuing a warning is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the right thing to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, parser generators do not detect grammar ambiguities -- they
</I>&gt;<i> detect conflicts in constructing their tables. ANTLR is not warning
</I>&gt;<i> that the grammar is ambiguous. It is warning that it could not decide
</I>&gt;<i> between two choices -- one of which results in a BROKEN PARSER.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It really is best to avoid these kinds of ambiguities and to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understand them if they exist in your grammar. Issuing a warning is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the right thing to do. The grammar author can take a look and say,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Yes, this is an if-then-else-like construct and I'm OK with the eager
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behavior,&quot; or, &quot;No, this is a mistake. I'm going to rethink this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rule.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No. This specific category of parser conflict always has the same
</I>&gt;<i> answer, always has an obvious meaning, and always results in
</I>&gt;<i> the parser claiming it was conflicted about choosing between the
</I>&gt;<i> obvious meaning and a BROKEN PARSER.

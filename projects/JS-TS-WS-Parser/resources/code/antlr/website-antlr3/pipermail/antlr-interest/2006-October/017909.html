I don't see why the first one is incorrect, but ok, I buy it ;)
One thing I cannot on agree on, is that a translator is allowed to  
introduce subtle bugs in my code. I think there's a tradeoff between  
readability and correctness. Granted, I can live with border cases,  
where the vendor says &quot;Listen, for constructs like malloc you have  
triple-check the translation, because we don't have malloc in Java  
and have to make assumptions.&quot; but these cases should be well defined  
and clearly stated. OTOH I assume you do that sort of thing with your  
customers.
That said, I value code cleanliness a lot, having worked on quite  
large projects, cleaned them up and seen them deteriorate again in  
the span of a couple of months. So I think I know what you mean.

&gt;&gt;<i> This is not generally the case with  artificial languages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Generally, but then again, it's 10pm, and my officemate is looking  
</I>&gt;<i> at a line of code like this:
</I>&gt;<i> typedef char MYCHAR[25];
</I>&gt;<i> ...which of course tells us replace any occurances of &quot;MYCHAR&quot; with  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;char[25]&quot;.
</I>
Yes? That's the way typedefs work. Am I missing anything? How's that  
violating the grammar?

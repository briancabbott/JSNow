<PRE>The thing with the GPL is that it does NOT prevent an author selling his
own work. If Prashant wants to sell Antlr Studio, that is his moral
right.

What the GPL does (and is intended to do) is stop *you* selling *my*
work (and cutting me out of the loop).

Somebody mentioned &quot;freedoms&quot;. I'm sorry, but an author deserves the
freedom to do what he will with his own work. If you don't like that,
you have the freedom not to use his work.

As for Ter's stance, my little project is LGPL and possibly GPL, but
that's because it's &quot;infrastructure&quot;, and as such others can build on it
without getting bitten by the &quot;derivative work&quot; clause. So others will
be able to freely distribute it, and ship their stuff with it.

Cheers,
Wol

Well, I originally meant that I can understand one's desire to make  
(some) money out
of one's own work. I didn't want to praise one or the other pricing  
model.

The GPL-thing just crossed my mind, as it always does when I thing  
about open source software.
Then I couldn't refrain from typing... :-)
For what it's worth, I totally agree with Terence's arguments. That's  
exactly how I feel
about these things...

Kay

<PRE>Maybe a bit off topic, but if you're into XML, look at the multi-value
data model.

If you're using XML as a data store, the paradigms are very similar and
we've been handling it for nearly forty years :-)

Cheers,
Wol

Subject: [antlr-interest] Antlr v3: Trees

I know that a major overhaul is coming on the tree handling stuff but I
just wanted to state publically that this is, to me, *the* area where
Antlr
can really make a huge difference to the state of practice.

Grammar-based tree transformation is great not just for the traditional
language &quot;compiler&quot; world but is also key to cleaning up all of the ad
hoc
tree crap that people are doing as part of the tidal wave of XML.

Speaking of XML, I think that it's critical to make sure that Antlr v3
efficiently and effectively supports XML recognition, validation, and
transformation.

Go wild,
	John

&gt;<i> From what I can tell, there are a few countries--Libya, Sudan, Cuba,
</I>&gt;<i> Iran--with whom the US has active sanctions and those are the ones
</I>&gt;<i> that might be affected.  In theory, the same restrictions probably
</I>&gt;<i> apply to ANTLR now, so this is not really a change.  I don't think
</I>&gt;<i> that you'll be thrown in jail for distributing ANTLR without
</I>&gt;<i> restrictions, but what do I know about trade law?
</I>
  There is no practical way to limit distribution of information
  published on the Internet.  I think that even the US government has
  this figured out.  We're all in the same boat.  I have published a
  bunch of wavelet signal processing code that has been used by people
  all over the world.  There is no way that I can stop someone in Iran
  from downloading it and still make it available to someone in
  Wisconsin.

  I know that the IEEE has some issues sending magazines to these
  countries (you could probably add North Korea).  I seem to recall
  that these were cleared up.  As far as I know the only way to really
  get into trouble is for a US citizen to spend US dollars in these
  countries.

  One way you can handle this issue, if you're really worried, is
  include a link that says that &quot;you can't download this stuff if
  you're from a 'bad country'&quot; (And, by the way, I think that some or
  all of the trade restrictions on Lybia have been lifted since they
  came clean about their nuclear program)  Sort of like the adult sites
  that say &quot;You're over 18 right?&quot;.

  There are also first amendment issues.  I very much doubt that any
  court would find that the government's interest in prohibiting Iran
  from reading about the Wavelet Lifting Scheme or getting the ANTLR
  parser justifies restricting publication.

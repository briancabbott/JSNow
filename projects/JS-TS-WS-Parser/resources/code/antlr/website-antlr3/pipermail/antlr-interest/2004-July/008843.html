<PRE>Here's the idea.  Follow my discussion in my article about how to write 
a parser which grabs tokens from the input stream and then only parses 
when it sees an interesting token.  In my example GOTO was one such 
token that should be parsed.  In your example it will be anything that 
can be an expression.

The following paragraph from my article explains what I had to do about 
the follow set expecting EOF.

It also happened that calling labelReferences directly from 
jumpStatements didn't work because the parser assumed that EOF would 
follow when in fact this was working more like a lexer which gets 
called multiple times on the same stream and shouldn't be assuming EOF. 
So I modified it to call labelReferences as a method, not as a rule 
call, to avoid the associated lookahead. Then I also noticed I needed 
to handle the case where EOLs followed the jump, so I do my own testing 
of LA(1) to decide what to do. To handle syntax errors properly I also 
added the expectingLabel variable and set it to false if something goes 
wrong. Finally, here's the complete working BASICLabelReference.g 
file...

Now that I think about it, there are probably other ways to handle 
this.  For instance if you aren't passing on to a TokenStream, you 
could get by with a parser rule like this:

top: (expr | .)*;

That should work for the calc.g example too (if the main rule in calc.g 
is called expr)

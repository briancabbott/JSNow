<PRE>There is a `clean` target for the ant script.

But the recursive nature of ANTLR makes this tricky. As Dr. Parr has pointed
out, the latest release is self-referential and needs `version 3 grammars`.
I guess that is from a previous version 3, as my belief system requires that
a thing cannot use itself to create itself. Of course, a thing can use an
older version of itself to make itself, that's fine, but the latest 'builds'
are something else.

Which makes it really hard for us grunts. I am a C++/C#/C/Asm guy trying to
meet deadlines. I am not a Java/Ant guy.

Sure, so it sucks to be me. Even so, I am not an idiot and it has been a
real pain to get a build up and running. Generated code from 3.1 is crashing
on VS2008 and I don't know if it's my grammar or because of the build
kludges I put in (like, *deleting* files from the release package).

It would be fine except I need a C++ target so I am using Jim's 3.1 C
runtime. But that means java -&gt; C -&gt; C++ burdened with build issues. I know
this is bleeding edge, and I am used to that (I am in game-dev) but at least
the builds should build?

I have utmost respect for Dr. Parr and his work, and for all the other
contributers. But if builds cannot be built out-of-the-box there is
something deeply wrong. Is there a build maintainter for this project? The
documentation is scant (yes I have bought the book), but my word if it has
to use java then `ant` from from the root has to Just Work.

Regards,
Christian.

Chris,

   I'm not much of an ANTLR expert, but here are my thoughts.  My
first thought is go read what Jim Idle has to say on the list, he
dispenses a lot of practical advice about parsing.  In this case, I
believe Jim's stock advice is that you are doing too much in the lexer
and parser.  In order to generate decent error messages, you should
just skip figuring out if the item is in capital or lower case letters
until after the input is parsed.  Just have one rule 'ID'.  Once you
have the whole thing parsed and in memory, use a tree walker to
validate that the input consumed by the ID that is after a '#define'
is in all caps.  If it isn't, print out a really nice error message,
when you have a lot of semantic information and context to print out a
good error.

First, you're mistaken about why &quot;hello&quot; vs. &quot;HELLO&quot; is causing you
problems.  It can be lexed exactly one way.  If it matches two rules,
the first rule listed wins (if you inverted ID and PP_ID, then ID
tokens could never be generated).  One of the things about ANTLR is
that the lexer runs to completion before the parser ever runs (even if
it doesn't, it logically does).  I always split up my lexer and
parser, specifically so I never get confused into thinking that the
parser will cause the lexer to backtrack and generate a new token type
(it would with other parser rules, but tokens, absolutely not).  The
lexer has some other behavior that isn't like the parser.  That's the
advanced lesson for a different e-mail.

So if for some reason you insist on doing the validation early do
something like this:

pp_input:
'#' 'define' (ID|PP_ID)+ (NEW_LINE | EOF)
;

Down lower, I'd point out that you really want to to be: (ID|PP_ID)
with no plus after it (or better yet just have it be 'ID' if you
follow the advice above), I think your lexer rule is not doing what
you expect.  Which leads to another piece of advice:

Lex your stuff, and then dump it out in a format that makes sense to
you, print the token and then the token text.  Make absolutely sure
the lexer is generating what you expect (the lexer has a lot more
surprises then the parser does IMHO).  Then go mentally execute the
parser, and figure out what is going on.  In this case 'hello' is
generating an 'ID' token, and your rule only allowed a 'PP_ID' token.
That is the likely culprit with some of the problems you are
describing.

&gt;<i> start
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;: input*
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;;
</I>&gt;<i> input
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;: ID+ (NEW_LINE | EOF)
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;| pp_input
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;;
</I>&gt;<i> pp_input
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;: '#' 'define' PP_ID+ (NEW_LINE | EOF)
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;;
</I>&gt;<i> NEW_LINE
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;: '\r' '\n'
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;;
</I>&gt;<i> ID
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;: 'a'..'z';
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PP_ID
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;: 'a'..'z'
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;| 'A'..'Z';
</I>
I'd not put '#' 'define' in a parser rule.  I'd make it a proper token
for clarity.

Next, I'm pretty sure you mean that ID has a value of 'hello', the way
you have the rules constructed, the input 'hello' is 5 tokens (one of
'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', and 'o').  So first things, first, I'd fix that
(and PP_ID analogously, if you insist on keeping it).

You aren't skipping whitespace, but I'm assuming you just elided that
from this grammar.

Next, are you sure you don't mean ('\n' | '\r') for new line?  I think
I'd just follow Jim's advice and ensure that you have a new line at
the end.  It would make the EOF handling much easier (or barring that,
just add EOF to as an alternative to NEWLINE rule and the grammar
becomes easier to read).

Finally, I'd stop using ANTLR works temporarily.  I'd generate the
code, and step through the Java in a debugger.  One of the beauties of
ANTLR is that you can tell a _lot_ about what is going on just from
the stack trace and stepping through the code (recursive descent
parsers are fantastic in this respect).

If it is spinning, that is generally a sign that you have done
something silly and have a rule that allow consumes no input and is
repeated.  There is nothing obvious to me just from looking at the
grammar.  You've got enough small problems that I'll let you sort
those out first.  From what you've sent me, nothing would actually
work, so it'll be hard to figure out what is really going on with
precision.

I'd split your input rule just for symmetry to be something like:

input :
     ID+ (NEW_LINE | EOF)
;

pp_input:
     DEFINE PP_ID+ (NEW_LINE | EOF)
;

Then have a third rule like:

stmt:
    (input | pp_input)
;

Modify the start to use it:
start:
    (stmt)* EOF;

I like the symmetry, and I would guess it makes it easier to read the
stack traces to figure out where you are (you can tell if it is
attempting to parse the input as a input, or as a pre-processor
input).

Again, my suggestions very concisely are:

1. Split the Lexer and the Parser up.
2. Do not use the ability to have generated tokens in the parser (read
remove '#define' from the parser rule.
3. Don't try and differentiate between the uppercase/lowercase stuff
inside the lexer.
4. Run the lexer and make sure it generates exactly the tokens you think it is.
5. Run the parser in a debugger, recursive descent style parsers are
how you would write a parser by hand, so they make a lot of sense when
you step through them and the stack traces tell you exactly how it is
attempting to match the input so far.

Thanks,
   Kirby

PS:  Assembling all my instructions, except splitting the lexer and
parser apart (and not running any of this, so if it breaks, keep the
pieces):

// Add EOF, to force all the input to be consumed, or generate an error.
start:
    stmt* EOF
        ;

stmt:
    input|pp_input
;

input
        : ID NEW_LINE;
        ;

pp_input
        :  DEFINE ID NEW_LINE
        ;

// NOTE: This is going to cause you problems if you have a '#', but
not a '#define'
// again I'm skipping that to get you past this point.
DEFINE:
    '#define'
;

NEW_LINE
        : '\r' '\n' | EOF
        ;
ID
        : 'a'..'z'
        | 'A'..'Z';

// Add a whitespace rule somewhere in here...

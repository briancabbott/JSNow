I have found this discussion highly perplexing. I too was surprised to 
find out that ANTLR Studio was for a fee and I probably won't be buying 
it. But let's see. Who has been hurt that he has a right to be 
resentful. I can think of two categories of people, those that freely 
contributed ideas to help make ANTLR Studio better and the owner of this 
forum who finds that his assets were used for someone elses profit. If 
neither of these groups are complaining why is anybody else?

As far as the price or terms of the beta test, if you don't like them, 
don't participate. You have lost nothing.

<PRE>So in your example, if I have input &quot;fake input ; some more fakeinput&quot;

//parser
semi :  &quot;;&quot;

//lexer
SEMI    :       ';'


When it reads the &quot;;&quot; from the input stream SEMI is matched from the Lexer 
and not a LITERAL_;, this is because the Lexer is used first and sets the 
Token type right?

So in the end does this mean that STRING literals are just tokens also? 
The main difference is that there is no Lexer matching rule generated? And 
if there is no rule you need to test for the literal if you want to get a 
precreated Token type, correct?  So where does the Token { } field in the 
grammar come into play.  Is this just setting up more string literals?  If 
so are the Tokens sections in Lexer or Parser mean the same thing?  They 
both set up Tokens?

Ugh.  I need time to read the source code of Antlr.

Thanks for helping.
Ron

This one has to be thought of in implementation terms.  For any lexer rule 
in which testLiterals is true:  tokens are constructed and 
then checked against a hash table of literals.  If the table contains a 
corresponding literal definition, then the token type is changed to 
match the literal; if not, it is given the default token type for that 
rule.  Note that this is independent of the parser.  I believe that the 
current implementation requires that all literals be defined in the same 
file as the lexer grammar.

Rules for which testLiterals=false are not checked against the hash table. 
 So if you have a rule
SEMI : ':' ;
and the literal &quot;;&quot; in the parser grammar, you will get strange 
results--the literal &quot;;&quot; has a different token type than the SEMI rule; 
since 
table lookup does not occur, you will never see the LITERAL_; value in the 
parser.

</I>&gt;<i>

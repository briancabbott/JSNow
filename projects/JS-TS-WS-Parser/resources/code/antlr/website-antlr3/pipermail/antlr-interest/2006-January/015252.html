<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; There are encoding prefixes in disk files, which I believe are standardized.
</I>
Well, on Windows boxes you have this horrible Byte Order Mark thing in
(some) text files. Unixes don't have something like that, the general
assumption (as far as I know) is that all files have to match the
encoding specified in LANG (LC_*) environment variables - everything
else is an error.

&gt;<i> There might be issues when you want to do a compare between a
</I>&gt;<i> L&quot;sumthin&quot; (from say a literals table) with something you just got
</I>&gt;<i> from disk.. have to match the encoding and/or have both encoded
</I>&gt;<i> canonically (or what was the term in unicode) (it's been a while when
</I>&gt;<i> I looked into this, but there might be a few gotchas (or I'm
</I>&gt;<i> pessimistic ;) ))
</I>
The major problem is that even after you have both strings in the right
Unicode encoding (e.g. UTF-16) they might still be identical but
different. E.g. a German &quot;&#228;&quot; (A-umlaut) can be expressed as a &quot;a&quot;
followed by the special character for a combining diaeresis mark or by
the direct symbol for an &quot;&#228;&quot;, depending on the normalization form of the
string. Probably the same for &quot;ij&quot; if that example is more appealing to
you ;-)

When I was using ANTLR/C++ I actually got along very good by treating
everything as UTF-8 and otherwise as &quot;magic opaque values&quot;.

Martin

<PRE>Johannes and Hamilton,

Thanks for the help.  Recompiling the runtime .net sources did get this
working (can't quite figure out how to rebuild the Java tool as ant
produces a ton of errors when I try to build the build.xml).  Looking
forward to getting into the fancier things, now the basic stuff is
figured out.

Kris

Subject: Re: [antlr-interest] FW: CSharp Target...

In case you didn't see my thread from a little while back, I was having
trouble with 3.1b1 until I rebuilt the java tool AND the .net assemblies
it was generating code against (I am targeting CSharp2 and generating
ASTs). I wasn't using the debug features, though. Personally I'd get a
simple non-debug example working locally and then once you're sure your
.net assemblies and grammar-generated code are valid and sufficient you
can try fancier things.

<PRE>Looking forward to it!  Is this book also going to be in in the 
pragmatic programmer series ?

&gt;<i> Hi Andy,

</I>&gt;<i> Sure. The book is rapidly evolving as I write material. I also decided 
</I>&gt;<i> not to write a textbook after this book, which means I can put some of 
</I>&gt;<i> that material into this one. That said, the publisher has asked me to 
</I>&gt;<i> do a short 250 page book; shorter than the current book.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's focus will be on language implementation problem solving. I am 
</I>&gt;<i> trying to identify a language application taxonomy as well as most 
</I>&gt;<i> common language implementation patterns.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to show how to build interpreters, translators, generators, 
</I>&gt;<i> and so on. Almost like a cookbook but it is more of a problem solving 
</I>&gt;<i> book rather than trying to replace existing interpreters, for example. 
</I>&gt;<i> it will talk about how things work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm currently writing a really interesting section, in my view, on how 
</I>&gt;<i> to precisely establish boundaries between implementation patterns and 
</I>&gt;<i> the words compiler and interpreter. :) This will allow me to make a 
</I>&gt;<i> precise taxonomy and list of their implementation patterns. For 
</I>&gt;<i> example, many programmers cannot answer the question &quot;Is Java compiled 
</I>&gt;<i> or interpreted?&quot; with any sort of precision (it's both of course, but 
</I>&gt;<i> when does everything happen?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will have an extensive section on symbol tables; what they are, why 
</I>&gt;<i> we need them, and how to implement them. Also, how to use them during 
</I>&gt;<i> semantic analysis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Presumably, another book to follow that would have more advanced 
</I>&gt;<i> patterns.

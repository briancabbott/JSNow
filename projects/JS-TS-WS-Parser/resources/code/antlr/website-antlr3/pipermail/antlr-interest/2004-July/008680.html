Yep, that sounds like a solution.  Semantic predicates seem to cover a
lot.

Actually, I think the usefulness is probably limited.  Even with
regex's the lookbehind wasn't introduced until recently.  I think the
main uses would be in the lexer, but I haven't thought about it too
much.  A prime example would be for finding the beginning of a line -
last character was newline or beginning of file.  But, I know this can
be done now with the column variable in a semantic predicate.

I'm doing a good job convincing, am I?  I just noticed it as a missing
feature and pointed it out.  I was just thinking that it would be nice
if the lookahead buffer extended in the other direction so that you
could access say LA(-1), LA(-2), etc.  No syntax changes to the ANTLR
language for now - other than having a new option for the lookbehind
depth (defaulting to zero).

Do you know of a place for feature requests?  Or is it here?

Well, it can do some but not all; you have to be very very careful with 
types.  For example, I just finished somethign in my little article 
about lists of children such as argument lists.  Unless you use 
List&lt;Argument&gt;, you cannot guarantee anything about tree structure.

&gt;<i> There is a cost associated with this. Of course hetero-nodes also
</I>&gt;<i> better support visitors for those times when they are preferred.
</I>
Yep, they make it easy to figure out what method is being executed 
because a method override is used not a big switch-on-node-type.

&gt;&gt;<i> Further, and more importantly, complex translators require multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> passes over a tree that usually means altering the structure.  Your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> static checking is gone the minute you jump to actions (whether a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grammar or a visitor) to manipulate the tree.  And, w/o actions of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> course you cannot translate ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are usually transforming from one definite structure to another
</I>&gt;<i> equally definite (but perhaps different) structure at each stage.
</I>
yep.

&gt;<i> Depending on the differences between the input and output tree
</I>&gt;<i> structures and how many of them we have, I can see that the
</I>&gt;<i> heterogenous approach may become unwieldy at some point. I still feel
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR needs to support both.
</I>
I agree.  Sometimes hetero trees are nice. :)  For big translations, 
however, 500 node types just adds complexity.  You should focus on tree 
structure.  Type systems are blunt instruments for specifying 
structure. ;)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Btw, I begin to understand that separate tree description is
</I>&gt;<i> closer to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ANTLR
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tree parsers than I thought before...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> :)  Hooray!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except for the fact that separate tree description supports the use of
</I>&gt;<i> hetero-nodes much better than ANTLR currently does.
</I>
ANTLR supports general &quot;ID should become IDNode&quot; level support as well 
as individual reference ID&lt;AST=IDNode&gt; hetero specs.  What else would 
you like?  I'll start thinking about it when I get to trees. :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But what if I need more that one pass over tree - should I repeat
</I>&gt;<i> tree
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> grammar
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in each tree walker? I don't like to have same info more than in one
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> place.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Agreed.  You have identified something that uses up lots of my spare
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;CPU&quot; time.  One solution is to simply use a tree grammar to call
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> action methods and then you can subclass the tree parser. Now, you are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> back to the visitor idea and don't have to repeat the tree, however,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this is unsatisfying as I've said.  I believe that we need a model
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where you can cut/paste a grammar to multiple phases and then push
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> updates to all phases when the structure changes.  In reality, this is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> called RCS (diff3).  For papers, i'll make up some fancy name ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a biggie me thinks. I've tried a tool that allows the grammar
</I>&gt;<i> to be separated from actions in separate files. A grammar template
</I>&gt;<i> file is then merged with an action code from another file to form a
</I>&gt;<i> complete ANTLR input file. It works but, it isn't overly satisfying
</I>&gt;<i> when done manually ;-(
</I>
Yeah, I argue it's hard to have your actions &quot;dangling in mid air&quot; in a 
separate file too. ;)

&gt;<i> I feel an editor that hides the distinction between the grammar
</I>&gt;<i> template file and the [multiple] action files is needed to make this
</I>&gt;<i> work better. ;-)
</I>
Yes, a tool that lets you derive a new pass from a &quot;template&quot; grammar 
is what we want. :)  I think diff3 that is ANTLR grammar based not text 
based will do nicely :)

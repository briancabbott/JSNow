<PRE>Hi,

</I>
The problem is that antlr uses a recursive descent parser. E.g. the
call stack of the various parser rules is significant and might have
to be rewound depending on a number of factors. If you mix in guessing
mode then things get tricky.

&gt;<i> &gt; I would not go tread way unless I *really* had no other option. E.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more passes, uses AST's.. maybe use tokenstream rewriting. It depends
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on what you want to accomplish.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My parsing problem is that sometimes fields in my text file are
</I>&gt;<i> delimited by '.', ':', ';', and various other tokens. My problem is that
</I>&gt;<i> in many cases these characters are part of the values of the fields and
</I>&gt;<i> in other cases they are delimiters. I can only know which is which at
</I>&gt;<i> parse time. So I thought what I was doing was the natural solution.
</I>
It may indeed feel the most intuitive, but the way antlr2 is built
makes this hard to do.

&gt;<i> Obviously I just misinterpreted the documentation!
</I>
I'm not sure if this is really explicit in the documentation. Although
I think there are some FAQ entries about it.

&gt;<i> Does anyone have any advice for how to approach this problem? None of
</I>&gt;<i> the examples in the antlr documentation deal with this sort of grammar.
</I>
If you're using AST's: Is it an option to pass the tricky bits with
the delimiters as big chunk to the parser? And then deal with what
they are in a tree parser ? (E.g. refine the generated AST in an extra
pass, the good old divide and conquer) Or alternatively use a small
extra lexer (and maybe even parser) to parse the string with the chunk
when you encounter them and then built an AST.

Cheers,

Ric

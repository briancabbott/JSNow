Great!

Interesting...this is what PCCTS did originally when syn preds were 
used.

Thanks for the hints, Anton.  Be assured that the next system will pay 
careful attention to speed.  I anticipate multiple options to control 
code generation that will allow you to turn the knob from 
readable/flexible to less-readable/hardcoded for speed.

RefactorIT looks like a great product...have you posted to the showcase 
at antlr.org?

Best regards,
Terence

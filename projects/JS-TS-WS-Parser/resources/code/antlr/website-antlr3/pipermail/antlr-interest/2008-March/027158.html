<PRE>Yeah - error reporting is a little complicated because you have to be able trace back to the input source through all various structures. I tried to make it as easy as I could to read the example error reporting code in the runtime and then you can override it to do something more specific. However, it definitely takes a few reads to see what is going on.

Jim has done more than a great job.  I have been using the latest C runtime build in C++(static linking) and C# (via DLL) projects and it works great.  Performance is excellent and the layout is logical.  The interface with C++ is trivial.  My only real issues with it have to do with error generation and reporting.  It works, it is just a little awkward.

Thanks Jim!

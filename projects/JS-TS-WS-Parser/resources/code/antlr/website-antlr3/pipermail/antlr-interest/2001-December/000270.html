Well, most people don't have nor will buy a tool to enter config files 
I'd wager (plus I think a &quot;real&quot; language would still be easier).  I 
argue that, yes, we can all read / write XML, but as a language &quot;hammer&quot; 
every problem is a human-interface language &quot;nail&quot;. ;)  As a person 
hoping to promote good language design/implementation, I have to put my 
money where my mouth is.  For example, since amazon got the one-click 
patent (don't get me started), I have not bought a single book there 
(though I do go there to waste their resources and then buy a book at 
barnesandnoble &lt;snicker&gt;).

Sorry Matthew, I know I'm being a &quot;prima donna&quot; but... ;)

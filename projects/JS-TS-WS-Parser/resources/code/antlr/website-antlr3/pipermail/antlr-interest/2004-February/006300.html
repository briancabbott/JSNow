Ah, it *does* seem to work now (forgot to ignore whitespace once more)... 
Thanks... Interesting enough, adding a statementComplete rule is the key, but 
it doesn't matter if you call statement() or statementComplete() afterwards 
so it seems!
Does that mean that the mere fact of there being a rule which calls statement 
and is itself never called suffices to not have the lookahead set?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, why are you doing single statement matches?  If you are doing
</I>&gt;<i> interpretation of phrases, I have a string InputBuffer class which can be
</I>&gt;<i> refilled.  That will be included with the 2.8 distribution--I need it to
</I>&gt;<i> support testing--but that won't be until after 2.7.3 is officially
</I>&gt;<i> released.  I can send you a copy if you would like.
</I>
In fact, what I want to do is parse some user code, which must be a number of 
statements, and transform the declaration statements into assignment 
statements. Should work fine with the TokenStreamRewriteEngine by Terence... 
So I think an InputBuffer which can be refilled is not of much use in this 
case... Unless I'm missing your point?

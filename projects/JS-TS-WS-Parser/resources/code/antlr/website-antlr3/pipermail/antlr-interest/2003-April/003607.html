<PRE>Stripped tokens shouldn't really be a problem.  The original problem was to get the text of the production, not the original stream.  We ONLY want the text of the matched tokens (or terminal nodes) for a rule.

Tokens that are skipped in the lexer will never be matched in the parser.  What does it matter if they are skipped?

But I think the problem with that approach would be that you will have some
things stripped out (like white space if you have that skipped)

One possible solution I think would be to get position of the first token
and position and length of the last token in a group, and then using that
information get the text data from the input.

Antlr doesn't do this for you.  You need to collect the tokens and get the
text out of them yourself.  Or build a tree in that rule and get the text
from the nodes in the tree.

Subject: [antlr-interest] text associated with production


Hi all
i want to get complete text associated with productions as we can do for
tokens. lets say following is a production
forStatement: forKeyword LPAREN initial semiColon 
final semiColon step RPAREN StatementBlock ;
i want to get the complete text associated with forStatement as we can do
for LPAREN and RPAREN.
Is there any such option in antlr.
Thanks and regards
Nitin Gupta

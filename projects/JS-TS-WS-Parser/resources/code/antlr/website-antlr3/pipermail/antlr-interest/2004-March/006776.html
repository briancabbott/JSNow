<PRE>I have an application that converts data fetched from a database with
one schema into the data model for a logical schema. I use the ANTLR
with C# and I have an SQL Parser that generates a bunch of ASTs that
represent each column in the logical query and which physical columns
are used to make render it. The tree parser is excellent for doing
ILGenerator.Emit calls to create MSIL in memory to make the
transformation and the performance is very good. 

I'm not sure if this is the type of operation you are looking at but if
your application needs performance I really recommend that you make the
extra jump and have your ANTLR code generate MSIL for the
transformation. 

Also from a security point of view dropping C# files onto the disk and
compiling so you can load them into your application domain. This opens
the door to rouge code insertion since there is a small lag between the
time you generate the file, compile it and load it. I admit this is a
small window and if random file names are used hard to do but it is
possible.

</I>
One of ANTLR's main selling point is that it generates code fit for
humans to read, understand and even edit (editing the source grammar
is almost always preferable however). Hence the choice of B for
ANTLR/C# was a no-brainer.

Going back to your options, are you aware of these toolkits?
 - Runtime Assembly Instrumentation Library
   <A HREF="http://rail.dei.uc.pt/">http://rail.dei.uc.pt/</A>
 - Abstract IL
   <A HREF="http://research.microsoft.com/projects/ilx/">http://research.microsoft.com/projects/ilx/</A>

Of the two, Abstract IL seems the more relevant for your requirements
as it seems to help in implementing option C.

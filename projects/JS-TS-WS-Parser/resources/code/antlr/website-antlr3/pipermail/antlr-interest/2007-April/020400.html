<PRE>First your lexer issues:

warning(208): SqlV3.g:842:1: The following token definitions are
unreachable: NL,LETTER

This is happening because your lexer is not defined quite correctly. In
these rules:

WS    : (' ' |'\t' |'\n' |'\r' )+ { skip(); } ;
NL    : '\r' ? '\n';

You are saying that '\n' and '\r' can be both WS and NL, and they can
only be in one rule. If you want NL to show up as a token then take
these out of the WS spec. But then remember that you have to code the
parser rules to see the NL anywhere that is possible. If you want the
newline related characters to just disappear then delete the NL rule
altogether. It is more likely that you want to hide the tokens but
distinguish the newlines in some way, so probably what you want is:


WS    : (' ' |'\t' )+	{ $channel = HIDDEN; } ;
NL    : '\r' ? '\n'	{ $channel = HIDDEN; mynewlineaction(); }

The LETTER issue is because this lexer rule should probably be marked a
'fragment'. You can think of a fragment as if it were a lexer
subroutine. It doesn't generate a token itself, but can be inserted in
other rules to save you typing out the lexeme it defines in many places.
If you use it like you are then the analyzer sees that it is being asked
to produce a token for LETTER, but that you are also trying to use the
same thing in other rules and this means it is impossible to work out
what you mean (it could guess I suppose, but would probably be wrong
most of the time ;-). So:

STRING: '\'' ( LETTER | '0'..'9' | '_' | '\\' | ' ' | '-' | '&gt;' | '='
|<i> '&lt;' | '+' )+ '\'';
</I>ID    : LETTER ( LETTER | '0'..'9' | '_' )*;

fragment
LETTER: ('a'..'z' | 'A'..'Z');

However your string token is only allowing a subset of characters in a
string and I doubt this is what you want. You probably want anything at
all that isn't the string terminator:

STRING: '\'' ( ~'\'' )* '\'' ;

If you want escaped characters in there, look at the example grammars
(download from ANTLR3 page) for the lexer for say Java or C.

Your parser is more complicated. First I would strongly recommend that
you do not tackle SQL as your first project as it is a difficult thing
to parse correctly and is highly ambiguous. ANTLR3 can do it, but it is
a tricky one. I would suggest that you study the examples first, make
sure you understand the book, then as an aid to understanding the book,
try something a little less complicated such as making up your own
language on the fly in small increments.

However, to solve the ambiguities, you basically have to inform the
analyzer which of n alternatives you wish it to assume with a given
input set. But, your issue might be that your grammar needs restating,
rather than an ambiguity you have discovered in SQL (though there enough
that this is certainly possible ;-). So, you could end up struggling to
fix something with predicates that is really needing a grammar
reorganization.

At a guess here though (your snippet does not give enough information),
what you have found is that you have a conflict between:

ANY comma_sep_list

And 

ANY expression

This is because in our atom rule you correctly allow precedence
establishing '('. So the parser cannot decide which this can be. It is
probably guessing correctly and taking the comma list option, but you do
want to get rid of any ambiguities of course. So, try this:

ANY ( ('(')=&gt; comma_sep_list

That may not be the issue, but it might give you a start.

Subject: [antlr-interest] ANTLR 3 newbie question: Decision can match
usingmultiple alternatives

Hi,

I have a question regarding a non-determinism. I'm new to ANTLR 3 and
I'm trying to write the grammar for SQL. I don't want to put the whole
set of rules since I have implemented only a subset of the select and
create statements and its already 800 lines long but if you consider
that it would be better if I post it please let me know. Well, so I
will try to explain myself using only the non-deterministic rules.

Everything was going fine until I decided to expand the language and
include the recognition of expression lists (that appear in the where
condition), for example I want to recognize something like this:

select partnumber, vendornumber
   from purchdb.supplyprice
   where partnumber = any ('1343-d-01', '1623-td-01', '1723-ad-01',
'1733-ad-01')
      and not vendornumber = 9011;

I need to recognize a expression list (which can or can't be enclosed
by parenthesis), where each expression is separated by a comma.

The rules I have for these are the following:

predicate
   : row_value_constructor ( comparison_predicate | in_predicate |
null_predicate )
   | exists_predicate
   ;

comparison_predicate
   : ( '=' | '&lt;&gt;' | '&lt;' | '&lt;=' | '&gt;' | '&gt;=' ) ( quantifier )?
            ( row_value_constructor | '(' subquery ')' )
   ;

in_predicate
   : ('not')? 'in' '(' subquery ')'
   ;

null_predicate
   : 'is' ('not')? 'null'
   ;

exists_predicate
   : 'exists' '(' subquery ')'
   ;

row_value_constructor
   : expression_list
   ;

quantifier
   : 'any' | 'some' | 'all'
   ;

expression_list
   : expression ( ',' expression )*
   ;

expression
   : character_expression
   | numeric_expression
   ;

character_expression
   : atom ( '|' '|' atom )*
   ;

numeric_expression
   : numeric_term ( ( '+' | '-' ) numeric_term )*
   ;

numeric_term
   : numeric_factor ( ( '*' | '\\' ) numeric_factor )*
   ;

numeric_factor
   : ( '+' | '-' )? atom
   ;

atom
   : NUMBER
   | STRING
   | column_reference
   | aggregate_function
   | other_function
   | '(' expression ')'
   ;

// Lexer
WS    : (' ' |'\t' |'\n' |'\r' )+ { skip(); } ;
NL    : '\r' ? '\n';
NUMBER: ( '0'..'9' )+ ( '.' ( '0'..'9' )+ )?;
STRING: '\'' ( LETTER | '0'..'9' | '_' | '\\' | ' ' | '-' | '&gt;' | '='
|<i> '&lt;' | '+' )+ '\'';
</I>ID    : LETTER ( LETTER | '0'..'9' | '_' )*;
LETTER: ('a'..'z' | 'A'..'Z');

When I call ANTLR I get the following:

ANTLR Parser Generator  Version 3.0b7 (April 12, 2007)  1989-2007
warning(200): SqlV3.g:248:34: Decision can match input such as &quot;','
{ID, 'avg'..'nullifzero'}&quot; using multiple alternatives: 1, 2
As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input
warning(208): SqlV3.g:842:1: The following token definitions are
unreachable: NL,LETTER

Where line 248 is the expression_list: expression ( ',' expression )*;
line and 842 the LETTER line. I've even bought the ANTLR 3 book in
search of an answer and I know it is there (section 11.5 Ambiguities
and Non-determinisms) but I can't see it.

Thanks a lot for your time.

<PRE>I was wondering if anybody had ever tried to use ANTLR to implement a
scanner in Eclipse.  I'm not talking about a plug-in to Eclipse to
facilitate grammar development, I'm talking about the reverse.
Specifically, a tool that can scan the document associated with an
editor in Eclipse and pull out information about the locations of
keywords, comments, etc. and then integrated this into the Eclipse
framework for identifying tokens, doing completion, etc.

It seems like all that would be required would be to interface the lexer
to the Eclipse representation of a document (so you could scan the
characters in the document) and then somehow tuck the results away so
that subsequent calls to specialized token scanners, etc. wouldn't even
look at the document but would instead just return information based on
walking the AST.

So, has anybody done this?  It seems like this would be a great
cornerstone for plug-in development because you could do real parsing
rather than relying on the (what appear to be) rather crude primitives
in Eclipse for doing this kind of thing.

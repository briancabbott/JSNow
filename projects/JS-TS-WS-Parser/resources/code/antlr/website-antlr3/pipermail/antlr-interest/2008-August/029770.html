Yes, that's what I'm doing. However the parser still contains an
attempt to invoke WS if none of the other lexical rules match; I added
a { false }? semantic predicate there so it will always fail, which is
a bit of a kludge (the error message returned is not optimal). It
isn't a big deal.

&gt;<i> I wonder if you are trying to do too much in the parser and what you really

</I>
It isn't that simple... YAML is _very_ context sensitive, so that
doesn't really work, unless it were possible to set up a two-way
communication channel between the parser and the lexer, in effect
merging them. The model is very different than that used by
&quot;programming languages&quot;, which ANTLR is superbly adapted to.

There are several hand-coded parsers for YAML, and I'm working on two
approaches in parallel. One is using ANTLR, and the other is
machine-processing the YAML productions to a simplified
recursive-state-machine form, with some special instructions such as
&quot;push_N&quot;, &quot;pop_N&quot;, and &quot;repeat_N&quot;. A run-time that executes these
instructions is relatively easy to create, and even retarget. The
problem is that it would be 100% backtracking (barring any
pre-computed optimization to the instructions). I was hoping to
leverage ANTLR's N/DFA capabilities...

Oren.

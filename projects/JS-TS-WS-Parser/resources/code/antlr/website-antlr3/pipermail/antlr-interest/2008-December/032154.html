<PRE>&gt;<i> From: Tom Wells
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hello Antlr List
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am working on a project and tasked with writing an HTTP 
</I>&gt;<i> parser in C running on an embedded hardware device.
</I>
How embedded?  Are we talking &quot;HC11 with 4K of RAM and 16K of OTP ROM&quot;
embedded or &quot;Coldfire with all the RAM and FLASH I could ever possibly need&quot;
embedded?

&gt;<i> I am 
</I>&gt;<i> loathe to hand-code this obviously and it seems like ANTLR 
</I>&gt;<i> might be my best bet for generating the parser.
</I>
If the answer to my question above leans toward the former, I strongly
suggest you roll up those sleeves and get to hand-coding ;-).  If the
latter, ANTLR is probably the best way to go.

&gt;<i> Does anyone 
</I>&gt;<i> have any opinions as to the suitability of using something 
</I>&gt;<i> like ANTLR for this kind of parsing, and/or done anything 
</I>&gt;<i> similar? I am clearly pretty new to writing grammars and most 
</I>&gt;<i> examples are of programming language parsers so it's 
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to understand how this might relate to something 
</I>&gt;<i> which seems more structured, with clearly seperated status, 
</I>&gt;<i> header and body sections, such as HTTP.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
ANTLR (and for that matter the LEXes and YACCs of the world) are eminently
suitable for doing exactly what you propose.  The &quot;unstructured vs.
structured&quot; concern you stated is largely beside the point.  Parsing is, by
definition, the taking of a stream of text with some sort of defined
structure and interpreting it.  The only variable is how complex and/or
sloppy the specification of the language in question is.  Parsing HTML with
tools such as ANTLR should be a relatively straightforward endeavor.

&gt;<i> Any suggestions, advice or pointers gladly appreciated!
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Tom
</I>
Hope this helps Tom.

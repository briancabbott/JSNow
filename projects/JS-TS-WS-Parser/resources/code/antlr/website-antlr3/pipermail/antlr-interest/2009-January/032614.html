<PRE>Meena Vinod asked:
&gt;<i> I have a new problem now. My application's .g is as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; CMD_CD : 'cd';
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; CMD_SHOW: 'show';
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; CMD_RESET: 'reset';
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; CMD_SET: 'set';
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; CMD_OPTION: (' -all' | ' -help' | ' -version' | ' -display')*;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; TSEP: ' ' { SKIP(); };
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The parser is defined as:
</I>&gt;<i> cmd_validate: (cmd)(CMD_OPTION) EOF;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> cmd: CMD_CD | CMD_SHOW | CMD_RESET | CMD_SET;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A valid input to my application is &quot;cd -help -version -display&quot;. I can
</I>&gt;<i> achieve this with the &quot; &quot; (space) prefixed for each of the CMD_OPTION
</I>&gt;<i> value. However, if I enter &quot;cd-help&quot;, then my application hangs on
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLRWorks and even my C code hangs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would want to ensure that there is a space between the &quot;cmd&quot; and the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;cmd_option&quot; (if there is a cmd_option value).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, my application takes values as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. cd -help -version -display
</I>&gt;<i> 2. cd -version
</I>&gt;<i> 3. cd
</I>&gt;<i> 4. show -help -version -display....... et al
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What should I do so that it throws an exception when I enter &quot;cd-help&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;show-version&quot;?
</I>
Your CMD_OPTION lexer rule accepts the empty string as a valid possible input.

This is generally a very bad thing and is the cause of your problem here.

When given the input sentence &quot;cd-help&quot; your lexer will happily consume the 
first and second characters as a CMD_CD token.

Next it will encounter the hyphen ('-') character. But your lexer rules have 
all specified that a blank (' ') must appear before any valid hyphen. So you 
lexer realizes that this particular hyphen is an recognizable character. But 
first, as you have specified, a CMD_OPTION token is valid as the empty string, 
so your lexer recognizes the empty string after the 'cd' and before the '-' as 
a CMD_OPTION token and emits it into the token stream.

Now your lexer is still looking at the hyphen ('-') character that follows the 
'cd' CMD_CD token and it realizes that this particular hyphen is an 
recognizable character. But first, as you have specified, a CMD_OPTION token 
is valid as the empty string, so your lexer recognizes the empty string after 
the 'cd' and before the '-' as a CMD_OPTION token and emits it into the token 
stream.

Now your lexer is still looking at the hyphen ('-') character that follows the 
'cd' CMD_CD token and it realizes that this particular hyphen is an 
recognizable character. But first, as you have specified, a CMD_OPTION token 
is valid as the empty string, so your lexer recognizes the empty string after 
the 'cd' and before the '-' as a CMD_OPTION token and emits it into the token 
stream.

Now your lexer is still looking at the hyphen ('-') character that follows the 
'cd' CMD_CD token and it realizes that this particular hyphen is an 
recognizable character. But first, as you have specified, a CMD_OPTION token 
is valid as the empty string, so your lexer recognizes the empty string after 
the 'cd' and before the '-' as a CMD_OPTION token and emits it into the token 
stream.

and as you can tell from the above discussion, your lexer is stuck in an 
infinite (e.g. hung) emitting empty CMD_OPTION tokens trying to handle all 
valid lexer rules before throwing an unrecognizable character error. 
(Actually, in my test rig it runs out of memory fairly quickly and dies)

As a temporary fix: remove the * operator from the CMD_OPTION lexer rule and 
put it on the CMD_OPTION phrase in the parser cmd_validate rule. Thus:

CMD_OPTION: ' -all' | ' -help' | ' -version' | ' -display';
cmd_validate: cmd CMD_OPTION* EOF;

I think this change solves this specific problem (at least is does in my test 
rig). But I believe you have a deeper issue(s) here because your TSEP lexer 
rule says that blanks should be ignored and yet you insist on having blanks 
between elements of your command; so blanks are significant. Which way is it 
supposed to be? I think by trying to skip blanks sometimes and require blanks 
other times by adding a blank to the text of each of the options is, in the 
long run, a big mistake. Just my 2 cents.

Hope this helps...

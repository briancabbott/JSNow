<PRE>Hi everyone,

I just started to read about ANTLR 2 days ago and i ve started with 
the &quot;getting started with ANTLR&quot; by Terence Parr and i think that 
this was a great introduction and following this i read a few 
articles from the homepage of ANTLR. However when i started reading 
the documentation which comes with the ANTLR download, i realized 
that i was getting lost inside the symbols, which really had no 
examples. &quot;ANTLR Specification:Meta Language&quot; part of the 
documentation is really hard to understand and i feel that without 
understanding it, i can't use ANTLR as a tool in my project (which is 
an ABNF Parser for MGCP). Can anyone recommend me some other document 
or a good example to start with.

Thanks very much.

Ipek Sarac

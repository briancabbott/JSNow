<PRE>Hello Desiree,

As the latest author of CPP_parser.g I think I can say that it
parses most of C++.

Our version does produce a parser written in C++.

Not being a genius, I think ANTLR is much easier to understand
than Lex/Yacc (top-down instead of bottom-up) but if you are
familiar with Yacc then I think you will some unlearning to
do.

If you are still interested in this version then I suggest you
try compiling and running it with our test data to get a feel
for how ANTLR works.

If you are then still interested please let me know as I am
working on an updated version which I hope will be ready in
the summer.

Best of luck,

David.

Hello,

I'm working on my master thesis in computer science at the
moment. I have a tool that can read C and do some
optimazations and other stuff with it. My job is it now to
expand this tool, so that it can cope with C++ (or at least a
subset of C++).

A part of it, is a parser of course. The Parser the tool uses
right now is lex/yacc based and generates C++ output. I tried
expanding this parser so that it can read C++, but I didn't
really cope with that (after some googling on the net, I guess
I'm not the only one having this problem).

Now I've found ANTLR and wonder if I could use it for my
purposes. But I'm not quite sure if what I'm thinking about
would work. &quot;My&quot; tool is C++ based and as I've read, ANTLR is
Java-based. At the moment, I don't really know how to put that
together, because I need a parser that can work with and
instatiate my C++-classes I have built. Is something like this
possible?

I have found an C++ grammar on the ANTLR website. Does anyone
of you know, if this grammar works and if it can parse all
C++-Features? If there are features, that aren't supported,
which ones are that?

I hope someone can give me a hint.

Bye,
Desiree

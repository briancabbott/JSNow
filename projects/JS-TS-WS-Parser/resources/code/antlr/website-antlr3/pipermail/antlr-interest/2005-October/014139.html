<PRE>Actually, replying to a digest without trimming tends to die off pretty
quick. It's akin to hitting a nail with a hammer but getting your thumb
instead every time ... :-)

Many digests are size-triggered, so a digest-sized reply will trigger
the next digest ... the offender is mailbombing themselves ...

Shame the same logic doesn't work for those other obnoxious practices
you mention - but many of us have no control thereover. For example, the
footer I know will be on the end of this message wasn't put there by me
- and I can't stop our mailserver doing it for me :-(

Cheers,
Wol

The same thing applies to anti-virus footers, signatures and other  
irrelevant stuff...but I guess we won't get rid
of that behavior anytime soon :-(

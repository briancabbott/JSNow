Hi.  First, are you parsing C# or are you parsing simple field/value  
pairs?  Second, yes exceptions are slooooow!  Best to avoid syntactic  
predicates if you can.  I've seen people use them in exceptions and  
get exponential behavior.

&gt;<i> If you are a Java person applying Java thinking to C#, you'll  
</I>&gt;<i> probably say &quot;well the C# compiler is broken -- those performance  
</I>&gt;<i> issues are a Microsoft flaw, not an Antlr problem.&quot;  I disagree.   
</I>&gt;<i> In my experience, C# libraries simply don't throw hundreds of  
</I>&gt;<i> exceptions per second, and most exceptions correspond to real  
</I>&gt;<i> errors that end up being displayed in the GUI.  Since the Antlr web  
</I>&gt;<i> site very clearly advertises support for C#, I think this should  
</I>&gt;<i> warrant at least a gesture at compliance with the conventions for  
</I>&gt;<i> this platform.  In case there's any doubt, here's an unambiguous  
</I>&gt;<i> excerpt from a Microsoft &quot;Best Practices&quot; document:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/aqzzh">http://tinyurl.com/aqzzh</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Exceptions Are For Exceptional Circumstances
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do not throw exceptions as a means of communicating between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; components -- use events for that. Exceptions should not be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thrown in cases where completely expected results occur. For
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; example, a component that reads text files should not throw an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exception when it reaches the end of the file. This is a case
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where an event would be appropriate. By limiting throwing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exceptions to exceptional cases, you will help developers to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; debug their application rapidly by not having to wade through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; numerous 'expected' exceptions.
</I>
Yes, in generated programs however I believe it's an &quot;exception&quot; to  
the rule. ;)  That said, I'm going to try to avoid exceptions in v3.

&gt;<i> This brings us to my second point:  trying to debug a application  
</I>&gt;<i> with Antlr calls.  In C#, NORMALLY in I would just set my debugger  
</I>&gt;<i> to break whenever an exception is thrown, and then hit F5 a few  
</I>&gt;<i> times until I reach the bug.  With Antlr, this is no longer  
</I>&gt;<i> possible.  Instead I have to turn off exception trapping, set a  
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoint somewhere near the problem but after the parser has  
</I>&gt;<i> finished, run to the breakpoint, then then re-enable exception  
</I>&gt;<i> trapping to catch the &quot;real&quot; error.  If Antlr is being called in a  
</I>&gt;<i> loop, this often requires hacking the code to add some kind of  
</I>&gt;<i> counter or if/then test around the breakpoint.  This is what  
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft means when they say &quot;wade through numerous expected  
</I>&gt;<i> exceptions&quot;, and it is a real headache.
</I>
Agreed.  Debugging is not a problem until you say &quot;run until you hit  
an exception&quot;.

&gt;<i> In conclusion:  With regards to Java, we've discussed three  
</I>&gt;<i> possible choices (exceptions, no exceptions, or supporting both),  
</I>&gt;<i> and there have been good arguments in favor of each choice.  But  
</I>&gt;<i> for the C# version, I don't see how there can be any debate at all.
</I>
Thanks very much for the valuable info.  I'm going to try for no- 
exceptions to see what happens.  Note that v3 should make syn preds  
MUCH less needed.

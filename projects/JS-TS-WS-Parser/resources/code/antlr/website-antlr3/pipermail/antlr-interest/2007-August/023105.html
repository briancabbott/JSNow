 &gt; confusion for me that how to extract data after successful parsing?
Well, there's a couple of ways...

 &gt; Let me explain you further that I have to create a SQL QUERY like
 &gt; language for a web portal where different 'custom objects' would be
 &gt; add/retrieved by using SQL like language. for example:
 &gt;
 &gt; &quot;Select objModule from Module Respositoary where @type='entertainment' &quot;
 &gt;
 &gt; now lets suppose i successfully generate grammer and parse as well by
 &gt; using ANTLR generated code. Now How do I pick required 'objModule' of
 &gt; type ='entertainment'? can ANTLR allows to make custom functions
 &gt; which should be parsed after successful parsing? if not then should I
Yes, that's one way - they're called actions, can be specified as part 
of your grammar and can contain any Java code you need at that point.

 &gt; pick values from SYMBOL TABLE?
There's another way, where you just generate AST (abstract syntax tree)
and work on it outside the grammar (i.e. by writing _another_ so called
tree parser), but I really wouldn't recommend that - that way didn't 
exist in 1998 (other than as a gleam in some computer scientist's eye 
:<i>-) ), so you haven't seen it before, and I fail to see the advantages 
</I>of complicating my parsing that way - but of course, perhaps it's just 
because I don't understand...

P.S.: If you're doing something like SQL, there's an SQL grammar (for 
the previous version of ANTLR) at 
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/grammar/1062280680642/MS_SQL_SELECT.html">http://www.antlr.org/grammar/1062280680642/MS_SQL_SELECT.html</A> , which I 
found quite useful.

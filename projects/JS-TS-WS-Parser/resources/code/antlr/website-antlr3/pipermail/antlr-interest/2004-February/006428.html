<PRE>I've gotten a lot more done on that grammar i was asking about, but
i'm still stuck on two points, and i was hoping that someone would be
willing to take the time to examine what i do have done and perhaps
offer some critiques on it overall, and also help me with the two
sticking points i have.

The grammar is a bit large, so for politeness' sake i put it on my
site at <A HREF="http://offline.pointclark.net/vcard.g">http://offline.pointclark.net/vcard.g</A> , Feel free to snag it
and look at it.

Anyway, first thing is the two problems i'm having specifically:

First, there are indeterminacies in the grammar on lines 39-51 (5 of
them) that i don't get - i can't seem to get rid of them.

Second, there's a part of the vcard spec that essentially allows the
value for an item to be pretty much any format, so how do i look for
that?  When i reach the point in the line where there can be a value,
it could be plain text, quoted-printable, base64 encoded, or some
other as-yet unknown arbitrary encoding.  The only thing i do know at
this point is that i can pretty much be assured that everything
following a colon in the line will be a value of some kind, and
there's nothing else that comes after it.

With respect to other critiques, as far as i'm concerned, if you're
kind enough to take the time to examine this novice's work, i will be
more than happy to learn from you.

Thanks in advance.

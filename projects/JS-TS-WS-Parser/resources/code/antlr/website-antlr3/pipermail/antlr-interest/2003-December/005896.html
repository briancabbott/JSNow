<PRE>I can't think of any reason an LL grammar couldn't be one method per rule.
Do you have a counter example?

My understanding of LALL is that it &quot;simply&quot; collapses the search space for
lookahead tests at the expense of some accuracy.  I don't see any reason why
doing that would be related to the one method per rule question.

All this makes me wonder if there is any way to have a recursive descent 
compiler generator handling all LL grammars that still has a single 
method per grammar rule? If not is this one of the reasons ANTLR does 
LALL instead of LL?

</I>&gt;<i>At first sight, this grammar seems a bit (a lot?) wacky.  
</I>&gt;<i>Bison runs with 122 warnings and 44 reduce/reduce conflicts. 
</I>&gt;<i>The warnings can be fixed with appropriate action code, which 
</I>&gt;<i>has presumably been removed from the grammar. The R/R 
</I>&gt;<i>conflicts arise from:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> typecast
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	: '(' typename ')' lvalue				
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	| '(' typename ')' constant				
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	| '(' typename ')' unarypostfixexpression
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unarypostfixexpression
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>						
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	| lvalue
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> 	| constant						
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	&lt;etc&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In other words, in 'a = (int)b', is 'b' an lvalue/constant or 
</I>&gt;<i>a unarypostfixexpression? Bison selects the typecast by 
</I>&gt;<i>default, but this is badly designed.
</I>
Yes. I'd been trying to stick as closely as possible to the given grammar
rather than relying on my understanding of the language to create my own one
from scratch, but when I came to that part I scratched my head for a bit and
then stripped it out and put something more conventional in it's place. This
language doesn't have user-defined types, so typecasts can be detected with
fixed lookahead even without a symbol table.

&gt;<i>Bison fixes your priority problem by explicitly assigning a 
</I>&gt;<i>high priority to vector_initializer:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vector_initializer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	: '&lt;' expression ',' expression ',' expression '&gt;'	
</I>&gt;<i>%prec INITIALIZER
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	| ZERO_VECTOR
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>where INITIALIZER has the highest operator priority (see the 
</I>&gt;<i>%left/right/nonassoc list). I can't quite get my head around 
</I>&gt;<i>this, but I suspect that if you modify your test from
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vector v = &lt;1,2, 5&gt;6 &gt; &gt; &lt;1,2,3&gt;;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>to either 'vector v = &lt;1,2, 5&lt;6 &gt; &gt; &lt;1,2,3&gt;;' or 'vector v = 
</I>&gt;<i>&lt;1,2, 5&gt;6 &gt; &lt; &lt;1,2,3&gt;;'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>then you'll get a syntax error. I can't immediately see how the '&lt;' 
</I>&gt;<i>relational works at all - does it?
</I>
Your first example works, the second gives a parse error. The relational
operators work fine in most well-formed examples because when you get down to
the postfixExpression rule (which contains the vector initializer), there
isn't a '&lt;' or '&gt;' in the immediate lookahead. In the relationalExpression
rule:

relationalExpression
	: shiftExpression 
	  ( options { greedy=true;} : 
          (LEFT_ANGLE^ | LESSTHAN_EQUALS^ | GREATER_EQUALS^ | RIGHT_ANGLE^)
shiftExpression 
         )*
	;

For input &quot;5 &lt; 6&quot;, shiftExpression (and decendents) is in both cases
presented with a constant. And because it parses OK on it's own, it also
parses OK as a component of a vector. The following even parses OK:-

vector v = &lt;1, 2, &lt;3,4,5&gt; &gt;;

Even though it isn't valid within the type system. And it parses the
following OK, even though the game's original parser barfs on it for
unspecified reasons:-

vector v = &lt;1,2, &lt;6,7,8&gt; == &lt;6,7,8&gt; &gt;;

The only problem it does have is where a vector initializer is followed by
'&lt;'. As in:-

vector v = &lt;1,2,3&gt; &lt; 6;

&gt;<i>From the debugger I can see that what's happening is that it gets to the
</I>third sub-expression started by the '3', it then sees the '&gt;' as part of the
sub-expression and the following '&lt;' as the start of another vector
initializer which then throws the exception when the '6' is followed by the
';' instead of a ','. 

What I don't understand is why the '&gt;' following the '3' is swallowed as part
of the sub-expression only when there's a following '&lt;' as if you change the
final '&lt;' for any other operator it parses just fine! It's like I understand
how it gets seen as the start of another vector initializer, but not how the
antlr generated code an see it as such at the relationalExpression level.

Only '==' and '!=' are valid operators for acting on vectors. Other operators
seem to be excluded at the type-checking stage by the game's compiler, but I
could cheat a bit and exclude them from mine at the syntax level by passing a
parameter down from relational expression that stops the vector initializer
sub-rule matching '&lt;' via a semantic action when it follows a '&gt;' matched as
part of a relational expression. I think possibly it would be too late by
that stage as the real problem is that what should be the closing '&gt;' of the
main initializer is treated as part of the sub-expression for some reason,
what happens after that just obscures the error.

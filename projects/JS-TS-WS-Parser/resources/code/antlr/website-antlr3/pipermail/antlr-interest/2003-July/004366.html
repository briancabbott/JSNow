<PRE>I'd refer you to clause 7 too ...

Note that it says the purpose of all the previous stuff is &quot;to enable MS
to continue shipping existing product 'as is' &quot;. Hence the ban on
improving it ... Note also that the &quot;existing product&quot; was called &quot;Java&quot;
when it breached the compatibility requirements and, as such, was not
allowed to be called Java as per the contract.

In other words, this was a &quot;get-out&quot; agreement, to avoid MS being forced
to pull the plug on Java developers - it was in Sun's interest and in
MS's interest to allow the existing state of affairs to continue, but
Sun did not want MS to make further incompatible modifications.

Oh - and when I said MS was behaving like a spoilt brat I wasn't
thinking of the current legal spat - I was thinking of this one. It was
ALWAYS an option open to MS to submit their JVM for testing, and if it
had passed the compatibility tests it would have been fine to ship. But
MS chose to drop the product, rather than fix those places where it
failed the compatibility tests.

The whole point of the Sun lawsuit was that MS had licenced Sun code,
and was using the Java trademark, and contrary to the terms of the
contract was shipping a product that failed the compatibility tests. If
MS had fixed the compatibility problem they would have been allowed to
continue shipping updated JVMs.

All that agreement says is that MS could continue to sell their existing
1.1.4 JVM. It also prevents them shipping an improved product that is in
breach of the original contract. If MS had chosen to abide by the
contract then they could have shipped an updated JVM! THAT is why I said
they were behaving like spoilt brats - they broke their side of the
agreement, and when the other side complained they picked up their
marbles and went home ...

Cheers,
Wol

&gt;<i> Where's the legal stuff saying it CAN'T be compatible?

- see section 6(a) and others
They can not even improve performance (!) - section 7(a)iii

Well, you are right. It can be compatible but ... they (MS) would 
need a new license for it. Current license does not allow them to go 
beyond version 1.1.4 (<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/pr/2001/01/pr010123-">http://java.sun.com/pr/2001/01/pr010123-</A>
01.html).

I think MS is just afraid that if they continue to develop new 
versions compatible with new &quot;official&quot; versions Sun could try to 
prove in court that this is still Java but named J#. (J++ was not 
named Java too). And they would probably win.

Of course MS could get a new license but I am not sure they actually 
could. And right now, I am sure, they do not want to.
Remember, whatever they say this is primary about business and 
competition.

&gt;<i> MS is acting like a spoilt brat
</I>
Well, I think it is kind of new Sun's point of view, when they want 
MS to distribute their VM :) But read their older statements...

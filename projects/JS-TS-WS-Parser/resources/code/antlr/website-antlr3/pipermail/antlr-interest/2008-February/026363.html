Hello Johannes,

antlr-2007-12-28.10 was the first pre-release that can compile my
grammar.   I just tried ANTLR 3.0.1, it runs for 6 minutes before
running out of heap space with -Xmx512m.

So yes: antlr-2007-12-28.10 to antlr-2007-12-31.14 were really great
pre-releases, they compile my grammar faster that ANTLR 3.0.1 and
current pre-releases:

 25416 ms - antlr-2007-12-31.14 - love this pre-release!
361301 ms - antlr-2007-12-31.17 - first release with the change.
405494 ms - antlr-2008-02-05.15 - its great that it compiles it.

There is a comment added to the CHANGES.TXT file between the
antlr-2007-12-31.14 and antlr-2007-12-31.17 pre-releases:

+ * Added the start of a semantic predicate computation for LL(1) to solve
+   a problem with slow grammar analysis even with k=1 due to predicates.
+   Then I realized the problem with that grammar was elsewhere.
+   Semantic context really shouldn't be used when preventing closure
+   recomputation.  The predicates became huge even though the reduced
+   value would be no different.  The analyzer seems faster now that
+   I am not testing predicate values all the time.  Further it may
+   terminate sooner just due to reduced closure recursion.
+ 
  * Moved FIRST/FOLLOW computations to a separate class LL1Analyzer to
    tidy up.

I was crazy enough to be working on my grammar on New Years Eve as well.

The output for antlr-2007-12-31.17 pre-release is below, the outputs
for antlr-2007-12-31.14 and antlr-2008-02-05.15 were in my last email.

Thanks, Mark

<PRE>I have spent quite some time trying to figure this out, and searched the
internet extensively (including the antlr mailing list archives) but
could not find anything related, so as a last resort I am posting this
here.

I am trying to replace our current parser (ancient YACC++) with an
ANTLR generated parser and really want to maintain complete backwards
compatibility.

For reasons that are lost in time, our language (Quill) supports
unclosed comments (or comments until the end of file), so apart from the
normal (albeit nested) block comment '/* ... */', just inserting '/*' in
a code body effectively comments out the rest of the code in the file.

I currently have something like this:

Q_Comment_nested
	:	'/*' ( options {greedy=false;} : Q_Comment_nested | .)*
'*/' {$channel=HIDDEN;}
	;

Q_Unclosed_comment
	:	'/*' ( options {greedy=false;} : ~'*/')* EOF
{$channel=HIDDEN;}
	;

The above (obviously) reports an unreachable alternative and a
recursive overflow because the unclosed comment matches anything that
the nested comment matches as well.

I have tried many different solutions like:

Q_Comment_nested
	:	'/*' ( options {greedy=false;} : Q_Comment_nested | .)*
( '*/' | EOF) {$channel=HIDDEN;}
	;

or:

Q_Comment_nested
	:	'/*' ( options {greedy=false;} : (~'*/'))* '*/'?
{$channel=HIDDEN;}
	;

Whatever I tried, I just cannot seem to get it right!

I am open to suggestions ( I know, 'comments are ugly', 'use source
control or ifdef instead of comments' etc., but this should be possible,
right?!)

I think that this is the magic bullet that people are missing. It seems to
me that the most common case is to remove things like quote marks from
strings and not to place char[4] before char[9] and add '$$$' on the end or
something, which would probably work out better in more extensive . In the C
version this would be intercepting the token, incrementing a pointer and
decrementing a counter. As far as I can tell this isn't that different in
Java.

The token generally just points into the input buffer (some trickiness may
be required from reading from sockets forever and so on, but there would
seem logical to always be some 'endpoint' for a stream, even if a socket
remained open for ever).

Personally, I would much rather implement a little bit of custom code for
the odd token - where I can spend time on it if it is important performance
wise, rather than sacrifice performance for the general case - simple is
best and it looks to me that Ter has followed the adage that it should be as
simple as possible but no simpler pretty well.

The point of ANTLR 3 is to make the generation of recognizers simple, but
not to completely rid you of any responsibility for the performance of your
lexer/parser/tree parser. The most convenient expression is not necessarily
the best.

That said, if this became the number one perceived 'problem' with ANTLR 3,
then I will be applauding as then there is only that feature to add to a 3.1
version ;-). I think that all Ter is saying here is &quot;let me come back to
this one if people find it a real pain.&quot;

Keep on rockin',

Jim

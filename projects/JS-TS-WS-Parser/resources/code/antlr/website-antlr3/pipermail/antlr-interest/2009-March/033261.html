</I>&gt;<i> hi I also had this problem when trying to introduce a backward

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway I never got around this problem and I still find it very 
</I>&gt;<i> aggravating. I am not too exicited about the look-ahead mechanism 
</I>&gt;<i> because if you have to look-ahead several charactes then make decision 
</I>&gt;<i> you have to go back in the stream and then rematch those characters... 
</I>&gt;<i> Also I tried to port a hand-written parser/lexer to ANTLR which used a 
</I>&gt;<i> state table and some context sensitive decisions and was not able too 
</I>&gt;<i> port this. First I ran into the code too large exceptions and then 
</I>&gt;<i> into unresolvable amigiousties. Also semantic predicates do not help 
</I>&gt;<i> too much because ANTLR still uses look-ahead in the presence of 
</I>&gt;<i> semantic predicates - I would like to switch it off - how?? - if I use 
</I>&gt;<i> semantic predicates I know what I am doing and I don't need ANTLR's 
</I>&gt;<i> automatic analysis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I also asked the question some time ago, and Terence said &quot;no, it's 
probably not going to work&quot;. Unfortunately, he didn't include an 
explanation ... maybe it's too tedious to implement, maybe there are 
theoretical reasons against it ... dont know.

&gt;<i> As for you, maybe you can try to make your grammar ambigious and turn 
</I>&gt;<i> on backtracking and memorization (for backtracking optimization). Of 
</I>&gt;<i> course a backtracking grammar is slower than an LL(k)/* grammar, but 
</I>&gt;<i> if you get what you want....
</I>
In my case, this only hides most of the error messages, leaving me with 
exactly one &quot;predication DFA construction timeout&quot; in a rule where I 
absolutely would not expect it :-/

Best Regards,
Andreas

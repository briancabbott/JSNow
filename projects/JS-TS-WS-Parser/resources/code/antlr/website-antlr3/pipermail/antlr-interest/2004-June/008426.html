<PRE>Hmmm...

Suggestion for Ter. I don't know whether he uses a 16- or 32-bit integer
for his tokens, but might it not be possible to add a &quot;token-space&quot;
directive?

The idea basically being that either Antlr uses a 32-bit integer, which
is initialised with the high 16 set to the &quot;token space&quot; value, or you
can tell Antlr where to start counting for user-space tokens (don't
forget 0-3 is reserved or something).

If you need to merge token lists, that would probably be a good way to
do it ...

Cheers,
Wol

Subject: RE: [antlr-interest] Merging token vocabularies

I think I need one huge token vocabulary in order to avoid overloading
integers when embedding ASTs, as I mentioned.

Suppose (for illustration only; this is nothing like what I'm actually
doing) I want to process a file that looks like

===
This is a document with C code and Java code:
&lt;c&gt;
class Bar {};
&lt;/c&gt;
Java is here.
&lt;java&gt;
public class Foo {};
&lt;/java&gt;
===

Presumably, I want to build an AST that looks like
(DOCUMENT (TEXT &quot;This is a document with C code and Java code:\n&quot;)
  (C (CLASS (NAME &quot;Bar&quot;) ...))
  (TEXT &quot;\nJava is here.\n&quot;)
  (JAVA (CLASS (NAME &quot;Foo&quot;) ...)))

and then use a tree walker to do my work.

Assume that I have an independently created C parser and Java parser
that I want to just use.  I can't just use in my own parser

options {
  importVocab = CParser;
  importVocab = JavaParser;
}

so I have to do something else.  As I mentioned, what I am doing is
generating a CommonTokenTypes.txt by parsing the CParserTokenTypes.txt
and JavaParserTokenTypes.txt and merging the vocabularies, and then
importing Common back into CParser and JavaParser and regenerating.
This seems to be exactly what you are proposing:  ensuring that a
Common vocabulary be imported!  Or am I misunderstanding you?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, it is possible to translate a tree from one vocab to another.
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;int&quot; types that ANTLR uses are really for internal purposes. You
</I>&gt;<i> can recurse through a tree and change the types to a difference
</I>&gt;<i> vocabulary. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This can be done in one of two ways. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Use the TokenNames array accessible from a parser/walkers. Lookup
</I>the
&gt;<i> array using the int type you want to change, get its name, then search
</I>&gt;<i> the array of the target by name, get its int type, then update the
</I>AST. 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Do the same as 1, except use reflection against the
</I>&gt;<i> xxxxTokenType.java interfaces instead of using the TokenNames arrays. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ofcourse, both token vocabularies must atleast overlap for the types
</I>&gt;<i> found in the tree.

<PRE>Ted,

  I think I know what problem your having.  I am intentionally feeding
the parser bad inputs to validate that my grammar recognizes only what
I want, and not what I don't want.  To do this, I had to add the stuff
that at the bottom to my grammar file.  I think it's a sign of an
implementation oversight in Antlr that there's no stock way to verify
that no recovery logic was executed short of reading in
stdin/stderror.  It generates a grammar recognizer for goodness sake,
it'd be novel if the API had a &quot;wasRecognizedCleanly&quot; method, even I
had to reset it between parses (even if it auto-recovered).  If you go
look at the gUnit project that has been discussed recently on the
list, you'll find that they capture stderr and then look for &quot;FAIL&quot; or
some such to see if it accepted or rejected the parse.

   You might have better luck if you use the DebugParser, but
unfortunately, in 3.0, there is no DebugLexer, so you can't capture
the Lexer doing auto-recovery.  It looked to be on a TODO list, but
not sure if or when it's going to be implemented.  I believe that the
interface you can pass into DebugParser has changed between 3.0 and
3.0.1 according the to the release notes.  I can't get either to
build, and unless you can get it to build, you can't actually read the
source to the several core pieces of Antlr as they are generated
during the build.  (It'd be really nice if there was a version of the
source that included the generated source for debugging when I'm just
running the thing.  Maybe it's there, but  Eclipse can't find the
source when I attach the jar for the Parser source).

First, you have to check with both the lexer and the parser, and you
have to reset both of them if you want to parse more stuff.  For my
unit tests, have handy access to both the Parser and the Lexer.

Then do something like this:

	    CLangLexer lexer = new CLangLexer(input.stream);
	
	    CommonTokenStream tokens = new CommonTokenStream(lexer);
	    CLangParser parser = new CLangParser(tokens);

            // Parse some stuff...
            // I added a bogus eof : EOF ; rule, so I parse everything
I want, and then make sure
           // that EOF is the next thing to ensure that it matched all
of the input.

           boolean isMatch = !parser.getRecognitionFailed() &amp;&amp;
!lexer.getExceptionsCaught();

  Hope this helps,
       Kirby

@members {
   private boolean recognitionFailed = false;

   public boolean getRecognitionFailed() {
        return recognitionFailed;
   }

   public void resetRecognitionFailed() {
        recognitionFailed = false;
   }

   protected void mismatch(IntStream input, int ttype, BitSet follow)
       throws RecognitionException
   {
      recognitionFailed = true;
      super.mismatch(input, ttype, follow);
   }

   public void recoverFromMismatchedSet(IntStream input,
                                        RecognitionException e,
                                        BitSet follow)
                                        throws RecognitionException
   {
   	   recognitionFailed = true;
   	   super.recoverFromMismatchedSet(input, e, follow);
   }

}

catch (RecognitionException re) {
    reportError(re);
    recover(input, re);
    recognitionFailed = true;

<PRE>Hi,

I started converting my v2 grammars to v3 and ran against some warnings 
when generating code for a very simple test grammar.
Below, you find the parser, followed by the warnings.
This grammar is a part of a grammar in v2 which I am converting.

In v2 the rule QUOTED_STRING was:

QUOTED_STRING: '\'' ( WS | '\'' '\'' | ~('\'') )* '\''; 

Now in v3 I get this list of warnings (see below).
In v2 the WS was needed in the QUOTED_STRING rule in order to increment 
the line counter properly.
I think I can solve the warnings by leaving out the WS rule since in Antlr 
v3 I do not need to bother about incrementing the line counter.

So, Can please someone confirm that I am right in just leaving out the WS 
rule from the QUOTED_STRING rule?

Thanks!

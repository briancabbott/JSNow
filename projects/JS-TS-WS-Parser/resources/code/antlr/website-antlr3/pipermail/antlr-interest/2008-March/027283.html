<PRE>(Austin.  Sorry for replying to personally.  Here's my reply done to the
group as intended!)


Happy to provide example text...

The following is a hand being played with &quot;Pretty Pam 10&quot;.  My lexer creates
tokens that are mostly words and numbers and my parser is being forced to do
major look ahead to work out what each line is trying to convey (because
things like 'PeggySue has 15 seconds to act'  or 'johnvfardella is feeling
happy' (among others) can appear almost anywhere).

How would I implement a symbol table dynamically.  Can you point me to an
example or some documentation?  I don't see it in the book.  I haven't
created a symbol table before.

In the example below I'd like to make the 10 players names first class
citizens (ie single tokens).

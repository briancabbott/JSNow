<PRE>I think &quot;the option to ask ANTLR to forcefully use my predicate&quot; ;-) is 
to simply replace the disambiguating semantic predicates {...}? with 
gated semantic predicates {...}?=&gt;. And this seems to work!

I haven't tested it enough yet and the book recommends disambiguating 
semantic predicates on page 287 (Keywords as Variables), but I think it 
should work as the gated semantic predicates are always hoisted into the 
decision DFA, while disambiguating semantic predicates are only hoisted 
when ANTLR finds a syntactic disambiguity in the production rules. There 
is no syntactic disambiguity in the case of my asmBlock so it doesn't 
add the disambiguating semantic predicate, but it cannot skip my gated 
semantic predicate.

So while this seems to be a simple and almost elegant work around to my 
problem, I'm still wondering if ANTLR's behaviour with my previous 
example code is correct or if there is some bug. To me it seems like it 
generates an insufficient prediction DFA. It believes that an Identifier 
followed by a Semicolon is enough to predict an asmBlock.. but that's 
wrong, it needs at least three symbols - Identifier, Semicolon, Asm - to 
correctly identify the asmBlock in that case.

I have slightly modified my example grammar's subroutineBlock and 
removed all semantic predicates. Without the semantic predicates it gets 
the prediction DFA right (see attachment) - it uses the required three 
symbols of lookahead now. But as soon as I add the disambiguating 
semantic predicates again, it's back to two symbols lookahead and fails.

</I>&gt;<i>     The solution provided in the ANTLR Reference book on page 287

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     However I have found one case where my tests fail:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Please have a look at the attached grammar in keywords.g. Debug it
</I>&gt;<i>     with the start symbol &quot;procedureDecl&quot; and feed it the input
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;PROCEDURE Proc; FORWARD;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The problem happens in &quot;subroutineBlock&quot; where the decision dfa
</I>&gt;<i>     chooses the wrong alternative 3 (asmBlock) instead of 2 (forward).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     To me the generated decision DFA for the symbol &quot;subroutineBlock&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     (also attached) looks erroneous. It correctly evaluates the
</I>&gt;<i>     disambiguating semantic predicates for alternatives 1 (external)
</I>&gt;<i>     and 2 (forward), but it skips the evaluation for alternative 3
</I>&gt;<i>     (asmBlock) and makes its decision based on the SEMICOLON token,
</I>&gt;<i>     which is wrong because the semicolon can belong to the outer
</I>&gt;<i>     procedureDecl.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I have tested this with the latest stable version of the
</I>&gt;<i>     ANTLRWorks bundle (1.2.2).
</I>&gt;<i>

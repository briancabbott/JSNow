The reason is historical ANTLR implementation practice--right now, the 
grammar analysis depends on being able to distinguish token 
identifiers from rule identifiers.  That is done during parsing of 
grammar files because ANTLR uses a custom tree structure internally.  
If ANTLR were changed to use ASTs internally, it would be possible to 
maintain tables of lexer identifiers for use in the analysis phase and 
do away with the lexer/parser rule naming conventions.  I don't know 
if that is a good idea or not--the current distinction may help 
readability.

&gt;<i> &gt; have found that even with my first grammer (a modified OCL

&gt;<i> &gt; wanted to move rules between the parser and the lexer fairly

That is unusual--most of the time, you can just cut and paste a lexer 
grammar from one of the ANTLR examples and modify as appropriate.

&gt;<i> &gt; each time I was forced to do a search and replace on the grammar 
</I>file to
&gt;<i> &gt; change letter case, even though the rule body was exactly the 
</I>same.
&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I have found that the ANTLR syntax makes the distinction 
</I>between
&gt;<i> &gt; lexer and parser seem almost arbitrary since they are both 
</I>specified
&gt;<i> &gt; with EBNF.
</I>
It does the same for tree grammars, too, and that can be confusing 
because ANTLR uses only one token of lookahead/lookdown (trees are not 
streams) when treewalking.  Also, lexer rules cannot have tree 
annotations ( ^ ! ), and parsers can only apply ^ to tokens.  EBNF 
describes the common syntax of lexers, parsers, and tree walkers; 
however each type of grammar extends on this base.  Lexer grammars 
have characters--'a'--parsers and tree walkers have tree annotations 
(^ !), and tree walkers have roots ( #( ).

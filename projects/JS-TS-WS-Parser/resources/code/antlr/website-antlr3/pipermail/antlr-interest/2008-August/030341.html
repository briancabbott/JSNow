<PRE>Jim,

I have hit a series of issues which I think may be bugs in the c runtime.  I
have extracted simple examples from my grammar to make it easier to show the
problem and have attached them with this email.

Is there a high level doc explaining the architecture/design of the runtime
files?  Is there a good way to ramp up on how it works besides simply
looking through the code?  I was going to try to help you debug this, but I
am finding it a bit daunting.

The examples attached should compile and run for you although you will
probably need to tweak the makefile with you paths and/or compilers.  The
examples are a quick and dirty solution to show the problem so they don't
have a lot of polish to work in an arbitrary environment.  If they won't
work for you let me know and I can polish them up a bit more.  Thanks in
advance for any thoughts you have or any help you can provide.

Thanks,

Kurt


-------------------------------------------------------

*Validating predicates in the tree grammars return incorrect token info*

To reproduce this run: ex1.exe test/tree_validating_error.txt

This produces the following output:
=====
(BAR (CNAME (VAR (CNAME a) (CNAME b) c) (CNAME _a)) foo)
-Imaginary-(0)  : error 6 : (0), at offset 0, near UP : syntax not
recognized...

tree_validating_error.txt(4)  : error 3 : , at offset 11, near foo : cannot
match to any predicted input...
=====

Looking at the grammar in ex1walker.g, I have the following validation
predicate:

// force this false to trigger an error
var_cname
 : ^(CNAME NAME {(0)}? cname?)
;

This forces a token to fail due to the predicate returning false (hard-coded
in this example).  What token should the error be on?  I think there is some
confusion here between a disambiguating semantic predicate and a validating
semantic predicate.  It seems the disambiguating semantic predicate wants
the error to be on the next token, but the validating semantic predicate
want the error on the previous token.  However, when walking through the
code, the function antlr3RecognitionExceptionNew seems to always grab the
next token.  In my example, this token ends up being the imaginary UP token.
 This leads to a confusing non-helpful error message.  Is it possible to
look up different tokens in the error handler?

Changing antlr3RecognitionExceptionNew to call _LT(tns,-1) for the
ANTLR3_COMMONTREENODE case (change 1 to -1 to get previous token) seems to
fix the problem for this particular example, but won't work for the general
case.  This change causes the following expected output:

test/tree_validating_error.txt(4)  : error 6 : (0), at offset 2, near a :
syntax not recognized...

It seems there needs to be a way to change the error handling depending on
whether we are in a disambiguating predicate or a validating predicate, but
I am not sure how that would be done.

-------------------------------------------------------

*Tokens have incorrect start and stop positions*

To reproduce this, run: ex1.exe test/start_stop_error.txt

For example, if I force a syntax error in the file, I get the follow error
=====
start_stop_error.txt(3)  : error 3 : , at offset 0
   near [Index: 0 (Start: 3497941-Stop: 3497941) ='a', type&lt;10&gt; Line: 3
LinePos:0]
=====

Note the start and stop positions are way off.  I think there were some
similar posts to the list about this problem, but I did not see a conclusion
to the thread so I included an example to reproduce it.

-------------------------------------------------------

*Composition Tree Grammars won't compile
*
This looks like a simple string template issues of getting pParser rather
than pTreeParser.

Here is the error:
=====
gen/ex1walker.c(314) : error C2039: 'pParser' : is not a member of
'ex1walker_tree_helper_Ctx_struct'
       gen\ex1walker_tree_helper.h(84) : see declaration of
'ex1walker_tree_helper_Ctx_struct'
=====

To reproduce, uncomment this line in ex1walker.g

// uncomment this line to see the problem with imported tree grammars
import tree_helper;

This was the issue I emailed you about previously and you asked for an
example.

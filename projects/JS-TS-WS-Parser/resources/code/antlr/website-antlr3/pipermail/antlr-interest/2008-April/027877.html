</I>&gt;<i> So for C#, changing the first line of BaseRecogniser.GetErrorMessage from:

</I>&gt;<i>   string msg = e.Message;

</I>&gt;<i>   String msg = e.getMessage();
</I>&gt;<i> (or even getLocalizedMessage(), if you prefer.)
</I>
Unless Ter objects against this change, I will include it. I prefer the 
same behaviour over improved functionality, as Java is the role model 
for all targets.

&gt;<i> It would most likely be similarly minor for any other target language 
</I>&gt;<i> that supports exceptions, and only slightly more complex for others.  
</I>&gt;<i> (C++ actually falls halfway between the two.  The standard doesn't 
</I>&gt;<i> actually mandate that std::exception have a constructor which can take a 
</I>&gt;<i> string and store it, so some implementations do and some don't.  But 
</I>&gt;<i> there isn't a C++ target at the moment anyway, so the point is moot.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But at the end of the day, having some way to raise user-specified 
</I>&gt;<i> errors which are treated similarly to &quot;standard&quot; errors (as far as error 
</I>&gt;<i> recovery and reporting go) seems like an essential thing to have.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What would be even cooler would be a way to link a 
</I>&gt;<i> target-code-block-that-returns-a-string to a validating predicate, 
</I>&gt;<i> basically cutting out the middle-man, since it seems to me like 
</I>&gt;<i> validating predicates are the most likely source of user-specified 
</I>&gt;<i> errors.  But that's a separate issue; being able to catch the 
</I>&gt;<i> FailedPredicateException and rethrow it as a custom one is sufficient.
</I>
I'm in favor of this, as this localizes more grammar issues into one file.

&gt;&gt;<i> I would argue against implementing Gavin's second suggestion at this 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time:  the token error display adds clarity for the user (yeah, you 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can look at line 13, figure out that &quot;message&quot; is in column 2, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then try to understand what just happened; but it is easier to look 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for &quot;message&quot; on line 13), and the current approach does allow the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user to override getErrorMessage() to support localization via 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> StringTemplate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The second suggestion was simply a logical follow-through from the first 
</I>&gt;<i> -- if you're using the text in the exceptions, and that text can 
</I>&gt;<i> usefully be constructed by the exception itself (as with 
</I>&gt;<i> FailedPredicateException), then why not do it?  Sure, still have the 
</I>&gt;<i> central method which can be used for localisation or whatever other 
</I>&gt;<i> overriding you want (Ter's right, it's a good idea), but why not make 
</I>&gt;<i> the exception classes self sufficient?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not really sure what you're saying about the &quot;token error display&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> though.  I never suggested removing that; I was suggesting that enough 
</I>&gt;<i> information be given to the exception constructors so that they can 
</I>&gt;<i> generate it themselves.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But, whatever.  The second idea isn't really all that important, it's 
</I>&gt;<i> just a stylistic thing.  The first, however, I think is vital.
</I>
Not entirely stylistic. After all, Ter used procedural programming in a 
place, which could benefit from polymorphism. Having a catch-all clause 
doesn't very well with me. Using the compiler to choose the right text 
message is easier and one might not have to override getErrorMessage().

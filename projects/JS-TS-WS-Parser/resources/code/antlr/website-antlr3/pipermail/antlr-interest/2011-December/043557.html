<PRE>This whole discussion is very welcome and rather exciting. As a relative newcomer to this technology, the direction that v4 seems to be taking nonetheless seems very right to me. I've done two very small projects with ANTLR so far. On the first one, I tried tree grammars since they seemed to be &quot;promoted&quot;, on the second I decided to do my own tree walking. They both had advantages, but I ultimately did prefer doing my own tree walking because it allowed me to take greater advantage of the language environment I was using (C# in my case). I also find debugging the tree walking code easier because it isn't a mixed language environment.

It sounds like the new approach with a &quot;callback-like&quot; interface also give me even more flexibility in deciding what data structures to use for my trees, which is even better.

I applaud the open mindedness and flexibility that Terence is showing in changing his approach!

- Andy

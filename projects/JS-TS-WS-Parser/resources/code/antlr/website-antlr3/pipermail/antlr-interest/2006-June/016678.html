Tried that and failed. Hell, getting tomcat to work was in itself a major
pain, now getting iis to talk to it is almost impossible.



Failing that, you can certainly run one of them on port 80 and the other
&gt;<i> on port 443 (https) so that firewalls do not interfere and ISP caches do

</I>

I already have IIS pages running on port 80. Only tomcat stuff, which is
related to account creation and login, is running on port 8080.
I like your idea about running on port 443. I will think about switching
tomcat it.

I don't understand the fuss. If Prashant has the feeling he want to  
sell his work rather than give it away for
free, then that is his decision, isn't it?
After all, developing software is quite a bit of work - and if it  
works well, and helps me to get my job done
more quickly with less hassle, then why shouldn't I pay for it?
IMHO that is one downside of all this opensource hype - there's no  
moral obligation to give away your
work for free at all. That's precisely the reason that a lot of  
people don't like the GPL, for that matter.

But I digress...:-)

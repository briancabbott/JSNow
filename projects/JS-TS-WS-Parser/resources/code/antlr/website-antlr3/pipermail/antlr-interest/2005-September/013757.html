<PRE>[RE &quot;open&quot; etc]

&lt;shaking head&gt;

Geez folks.

If you don't like the terms, *don't use it*. The terms aren't yours to make;
they're Prashant's.

Why does it *really* matter if he provides source? How many people *really*
read it? Does it make the tool itself any better or worse? No.

Evaluate the tool on what *really matters*:
* is it useful to you?
* does it make you more productive?
* does it actually work?

I used PCCTS when it first came out without ever looking at the source. I
needed a good tool for a compiler class. I had been using lex/yacc and found
it hard to debug my generated app.

Because it and ANTLR are open, I can extend it (which is nice), but that
wasn't why I used it. If it were closed source, I still would have used it
because it's a good tool.

Same for Eclipse. I use it because it's a good tool. Plugins are nice (and
easier to develop b/c eclipse is open), but nearly all of the folks I know
who use eclipse have never looked at the source nor even care to. Good tool.
That's all that matters. The rest is icing.

<PRE>hi!  crap. ok,Added the following to your post on that webpage:

&gt;<i> Ok, looks like we need some kind of formal mechanism after all, or at least a predicate that tests the input without consuming. Problem is I already use ~ to mean &quot;not element but consume&quot; and '!' to mean don't include in the tree. Maybe -LetterOrDigit?
</I>
Still, we could easily do it with a simple {...}? so ANTLR can still do it without formalism, just as PEGs force you to manually say that as well. :)

</I>&gt;<i> First of all, let me explain that the only reason I'm being such a nuisance is that I really want this to work! However, I'm afraid that in the end, ANTLR falls just short of being a scannerless tool. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem lies with distinguishing between keywords, and identifiers that happen to start with the same letters as a keyword. 
</I>&gt;<i> The sample at <A HREF="http://bit.ly/gT3Q1C">http://bit.ly/gT3Q1C</A> cannot distinguish between &quot;returnme;&quot; and &quot;return me;&quot;, because kreturn is expressed as: 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> kreturn : 'r' 'e' 't' 'u' 'r' 'n' ws? ; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My first thought was, just make the whitespace not optional. But, in C for example, we can have 
</I>&gt;<i> return; 
</I>&gt;<i> return me; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> whereas &quot;returnme;&quot; would be a syntax error. Now, making ws not optional is no longer possible; what is really needed is a way to express 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;'r' 'e' 't' 'u' 'r' 'n' followed by anything that can NOT be part of an identifier&quot;. Although you could re-write the return statement rule to something awful like 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> retstat: kreturn ws? colon 
</I>&gt;<i>         | kreturn ws id colon 
</I>&gt;<i>         ; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> the underlying problem remains: there is no way to prevent ANTLR entering rule kreturn upon seeing an identifier like &quot;returnme&quot; that happens to start with the same letters as keyword &quot;return&quot;. In Rats!, you would write
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> KRETURN = &quot;return&quot; !LetterOrDigit ws? ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> where the &quot;!&quot; operator denotes a syntactic predicate meaning &quot;LetterOrDigit must not match, and corresponding input will not be consumed&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Without the ability to express &quot;something followed by anything that is not a letter or digit&quot;, I don't see how to get it right in ANTLR. I very much hope I am wrong though!
</I>&gt;<i>

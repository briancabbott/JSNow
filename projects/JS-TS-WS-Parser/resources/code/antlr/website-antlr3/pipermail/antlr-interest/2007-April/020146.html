The C# language target for ANTLR 3 is not working yet, so switching over
should be postponed.

&gt;<i> The first thing I noticed is that the lexer and parser in all of the v3

</I>
As I don't know ANTLR 2 I can't answer this question. It is possible to
create multipass grammars, which reside in separate files, but those may
not be the same thing.

&gt;<i> Also, I noticed that in many grammars, tokens are no longer defined
</I>&gt;<i> (such as tokens { FOR=&quot;for&quot;; WHILE=&quot;while&quot;; } ), but instead single
</I>&gt;<i> parser rules are used to define those tokens (e.g. FOR: 'for'; ). Is
</I>&gt;<i> there a technical reason behind this? Is it simply a conscious choice by
</I>&gt;<i> the developer, or is something gained by using this method?
</I>
The tokens { ... } is still working and useful in situations where one
wants to define the keywords of the programming language. It isn't
required to define everything at this place because you may not need it
otherwise or it is easier to use and to read a short string or character
in the rule.

&gt;<i> Apologies if this are extremely novice questions, I am just trying to
</I>&gt;<i> understand some of the things that seem &quot;odd&quot; to me as a past user of
</I>&gt;<i> older lexical tools.
</I>
If you want to use ANTLR 3 in a more intense way than now I suggest to
buy the Definitive Guide at
<A HREF="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/tpantlr/index.html">http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/tpantlr/index.html</A>
. Definitely worth the price and able to answer most of your questions. :)

Best regards,

Bull.  Yours was the luxury!  I wire-wrapped my first 8080 system with just 
4Kbytes of 750ns memory.  The 8224 crystal was not stable above 700KHz.  I 
had to build an 8207 UVEProm programmer (and power supplies) and write my 
own boot monitor just to get the thing to run!

The Cambridge was a Z80A-based system that came with a Basic 
interpreter.  Anyone who worked with the real (original) Z80 knows that it 
came with an errata sheet that was as thick as the programmer's manual.  I 
think I still have it.  Now that was a programming challenge.

Try and top that you old softy!!

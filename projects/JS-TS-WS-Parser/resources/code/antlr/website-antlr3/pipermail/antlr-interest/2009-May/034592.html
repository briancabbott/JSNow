<PRE>As I mentioned once in the past, I've been working on improving lexer
performance for applications where the full information/features in
Lexer/CommonToken is not required. A key example is syntax highlighters
which have strict performance requirements and must be updated as a
person types. I'll start with a basic description of Visual Studio's
syntax highlighting mechanism and the information a lexer must provide
it. Then I'll describe some pathological use cases that should be
avoided regardless of the lexer used, as the algorithms involved have
more of an impact than simply improving the lexer's per-line processing
speed. Finally, I'll describe the &quot;SlimLexer&quot; and how one could
potentially use it to gain an additional performance edge after the
other issues are addressed.

 


1         Syntax Highlighting in Visual Studio


 

The syntax highlighter for a programming language in Visual Studio is
called a colorizer, and is one item provided by a language service.
Visual Studio's syntax highlighting API uses a per-line scanning
mechanism. The IDE itself directly stores (caches) a few pieces of
information, where a few additional items can be easily derived from
them. The Visual Studio SDK provides a wrapper for the core API that is
somewhat more friendly when using a tokenizing lexer for syntax
highlighting.

 


1.1       Items internally cached by Visual Studio IDE


 

Visual Studio maintains an &quot;attribute cache&quot; describing the color of
each character on the lines currently on the screen. Naturally, as the
user scroll the window vertically, this cache is continually updated.
The information describing a character's attributes is stored as a
32-bit integer. The customizable elements are:

*         The color, stored as an index (range 0-255 inclusive) to a
customizable lookup table of colors available for use in the document.

*         A Boolean value of whether or not to show a line after the
current line. If you've used Visual Basic in Visual Studio, this is the
horizontal line that follows each procedure. It is a full-width
underlining, similar to the &lt;hr /&gt; HTML element, only with tighter
spacing.

*         A Boolean value of whether the character is part of code or
part of &quot;human-language text&quot; (a comment). This affects how the IDE
handles word-select mode, and improper use is the elusive source of some
miserable bugs. VSPhp actually suffers from this problem and it's quite
irritating.

 

The IDE also maintains a &quot;colorizer state&quot; per line of text. The state
is a 32-bit value exclusively reserved for the language service. The
intent here is the colorizer state allows a lexer to parse any line of
text in the file in isolation, without requiring any lookahead/behind to
other lines. A simple example of this is in multiline (block) comments.
If a multiline comment reaches the end of line X without closing, then
the colorizer state can include a flag that tells line X+1 to start the
line inside a multiline comment. Even though line X+1 doesn't contain
the opening token of the comment (say /*), it can properly color the
line without ever looking back to line X.

 

Definition: Line X has a valid cache state iff line X was colorized
after the last time its cached state value was changed.

Definition: The colorizer state at the start of line X is valid iff the
colorizer state at the end of all lines 0-(X-1) is valid AND line X has
a valid cache state.

Definition: The colorizer state at the end of line X is valid iff the
colorizer state at the beginning of line X is valid AND the text on line
X has not changed since the end state was last computed.

 

Here is the process for colorizing line X:

 

1.       If the colorizer state at the end of line X-1 is not valid,
colorize line X-1 to make it valid.

2.       Provide the state at the start of line X, plus the text on the
line X to the language service's colorizer. The colorizer's result
includes the state at the end of line X.

3.       If the new state at the end of line X is different from the
cached value for the state at the beginning of line X+1, mark line X+1
as having an invalid colorizer state, and store the new state in place
of the old.

 


1.2       Additional items the user can easily compute


 

The syntax highlighter can take advantage of the user state update
mechanism to effectively track the state per character on the line (or
per token), as follows:

 

StateAtPosition( line, column ) = StateAtEndOfLine( StartState(line),
TextOnLine(line).Substring(0,column) )

 


1.3       How the SDK exposes these features


 

The Visual Studio SDK offers a Colorizer class and an IScanner interface
to simplify the creation of syntax highlighters. Since lexers generally
operate on tokens as opposed to individual characters, there is a
disconnect between what people are used to and what Visual Studio's
cache stores. These interfaces allow the language service to provide
information about the tokens on a line, which it then internally breaks
into characters and passes the information to Visual Studio. Some
additional things to note about using this wrapper:

*         The wrapper does not expose (at all) the Boolean value for the
underline following a line.

*         The wrapper hides the Boolean value for whether a line is
human-language text, but the method is generally successful.

*         The wrapper exposes the ability to set the background color
following the end of a line, but only via an undocumented/sneaky
technique that you'd only see if you saw the wrapper's source code and
knew about the underlying interfaces.

*         The wrapper takes advantage of the mechanism in section 1.2 to
provide an additional 32-bit user-defined value per token. I personally
use this to keep track of ANTLR's token type, but there aren't any real
requirements since the value is never used by Visual Studio or its SDK.

 


2         High Performance Syntax Highlighting


 

A high performance syntax highlighter must avoid cascading updates where
possible. A cascading update is incurred when a change in the document's
text causes the state at multiple lines after the altered line to
change. Sometimes this is unavoidable; for example, adding a /* to a
line in C++ can cause multiple lines afterwards to become comment lines
instead of code lines, all of which must be updated. Other times, this
is avoidable. For example, storing the line number in the state forces
the state for all lines after line X to be updated when a new line is
added immediately following line X. If the line number itself does not
change the color of characters on the line, then the line number should
not be part of the colorizer state for performance reasons.

 

For a document with M lines and a maximum line width of W, this makes an
algorithmic difference of O(M) instead of O(1). You might only test your
colorizer with short test documents, but are your users programming in
documents with 10,000 or more lines? I know some generated ANTLR code
files in my language services are well in excess of 30,000 lines, and
some UnrealScript files I've seen have nearly 20,000 lines (my most
complete language service to date is for UnrealScript).

 

Even some of my own language services suffer from this problem; be aware
that it can be difficult to redesign your language service after you
start using the colorizer state for other purposes (like line numbers),
so make sure your state design is correct from the start. This is one of
many areas where I've formed new/improved ideas but haven't been able to
incorporate them in my largest language service due to the intricate
relationships between various IntelliSense features.

 


3         High Performance Lexing


 

I've observed that the Lexer/CommonToken features are overkill for
certain applications, including syntax highlighting. The simplest
example is single-line syntax highlighters have no need to store the
line number as part of the token. In order to reduce memory usage and
improve speed for this type of application, I've created a SlimLexer and
SlimToken for testing purposes. These currently have the following
features:

 

*         The SlimToken is a C# struct, which is a stack-allocated value
type that is passed to methods and returned by value. As long as you
don't force boxing by casting it to Object, it never requires heap
allocation.

*         The SlimToken is precisely 64-bits to allow efficient
pass-by-value in registers. As used in my testing, it stores:

o   Token type (16 bits)

o   Token channel (16 bits)

o   Start index (16 bits)

o   Stop index (16 bits)

*         The SlimLexer's tokens are strongly typed to SlimToken to
eliminate the need to box values.

*         The SlimLexer's most frequently called methods are
non-virtual, allowing the runtime to easily inline its small methods.

 

For applications that only need this information (or even a subset of
that), SlimLexer/SlimToken appears to operate about 6 times faster than
Lexer/CommonToken in about 1/4 the memory. I'm currently evaluating the
following items:

 

1.       Is this layout of SlimToken the best choice? I certainly
believe 64-bits is the optimal width for a high-performance
pass-by-value token. However, if SlimToken only applies to a subset X of
potential lexer applications Y, then I want to make X as large as
possible so more people can benefit from its significant performance
improvement.

2.       Do SlimLexer/SlimToken have a place in the ANTLR runtime, or
are they more suited to separate distribution?

3.       What are the possibilities, if any, for a SlimParser?

a.       Could a SlimParser take advantage of an unboxed SlimToken?

b.      Could a SlimParser have some unboxed output?

c.       In my experience, syntax highlighters don't need a parser, and
the parsers I've used need more complete token information than
SlimToken is able to provide. Is this a general view?

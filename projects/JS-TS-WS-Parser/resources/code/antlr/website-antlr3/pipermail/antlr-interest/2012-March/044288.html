<PRE>Eric (and list),
   I could revert back to Antlr 3.3 however I feel like I'm very close 
to fixing this bug for 3.4 which would help a lot of people.

I made a few mistakes with my initial port and have corrected them and 
pushed to my Git Hub repo if you or anyone else wants to have a look.

I think the one remaining problem is that variable types are now being 
ommitted from the resulting code which is the cause of the C compiler 
errors.  For example:

static void synpred8_CoreConfiguration_fragment(pCoreConfigurationParser 
ctx )
{
	pANTLR3_COMMON_TOKEN    value;


	value       = NULL;

	value_tree   = NULL;


	retval.tree  = NULL;

         // rest of function
}

value, value_tree and retval have not been given types, hence the 
compiler errors.

There are other errors of the generated code that are missing types 
however my assumption is that the cause is the same as the above example.

If it's possible for Jim or another C target knowledgeable person to 
take a quick look they might be able to spot the reason in the templates 
quicker than it'll take me to figure it out (if I can figure it out :p)

Cheers,

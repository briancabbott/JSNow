Yeah, we had this discussion on reflection, too. But I still think, that the
grammar is more readable. You have to consider, that we already have a Java
grammar with a lot of additional code, that do the modelling. A nice Java tree
parser grammar (which wouldn't contain any of the counter stuff, just all the
attributes/methods as nodes) would allow us to reuse most the code. My only
concern is performance at the moment...

&gt;<i> Anyway, concerning the &quot;match n times&quot; thing.  You're right...it would

</I>&gt;<i> 0...n vs 1..n?  Perhaps, for uniformity, we use my &quot;element modifier

</I>&gt;<i> variable)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ids2opt : ( ID )*&lt;2&gt; ; // 0..2 not 1..2
</I>
But in all these cases, you used constants. Many fileformats come a counter,
that defines, how long the following data block is. So you have to parse the
counter 1st, and then match the next rule &lt;counter&gt; times.
   
&gt;<i> The implementation would be pretty simple I guess.  Just defines a 
</I>&gt;<i> counter like the (...)+ does and generates an error if you don't get n; 
</I>&gt;<i> counter&lt;=n would need to go in the while loop, but should be easy.
</I>
Yup! The implementation should be trivial. But since we don't have that feature
yet, I'm trying to come up with something, that works with the current Antlr.
I thought about the semantic predicate again and that might work, too. Like
=======================================
rule
{int counter=0}
	: counter=blockCount 
	  ( {counter&gt;0}? blockEntry {counter--;} )*
	;
=======================================
Do you think it would work? So that block entry is matched &lt;counter&gt; times?

Ciao,
Andreas

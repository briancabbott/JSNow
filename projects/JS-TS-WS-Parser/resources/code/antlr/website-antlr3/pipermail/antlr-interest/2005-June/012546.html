I assume you meant &quot;meager&quot; ;)

&gt;<i>   It presents something basic and then jets off mixing a bunch of

</I>
Damn!

&gt;<i> For example, under <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/doc/trees.html#_bb4,">http://www.antlr.org/doc/trees.html#_bb4,</A> there  
</I>&gt;<i> is brief introduction to marking lexer tokens as roots.  Ok.  Then  
</I>&gt;<i> some stuff about building trees.  Nothing there about parser tokens  
</I>&gt;<i> as roots.
</I>
Apparently the doc is worst than that!  What do you mean by parser  
tokens?  Do you mean imaginary tokens inserted by the parser for  
which no actual input lexeme exists?

&gt;<i>   I think that is what I need for my problem -- I need to  
</I>&gt;<i> understand better how ANTLR wants to mark and construct parser  
</I>&gt;<i> trees.  So, is marking a new parser token as a root even possible?   
</I>&gt;<i> Well, keep looking down.  Token translation.  Ok.  Token  
</I>&gt;<i> factories.  Ok, I guess.  Heterogeneous ASTs.  Ok, real advanced.   
</I>&gt;<i> Fairly certain that is not applicable to my initial needs.
</I>
Interesting...define parser token for me and I'll try to help.

&gt;<i> Finally! An first example (&quot;An Expression Tree Example&quot;).  Maybe  
</I>&gt;<i> that will walk me through enough to understand how ANTLR wants  me  
</I>&gt;<i> to solve my problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Problem statement: a simple value accumulator implemented using a  
</I>&gt;<i> simple tree.  Ok, not really close to my case I think, but sounds  
</I>&gt;<i> like it has a similar level of complexity so I should be able to  
</I>&gt;<i> learn bunches from it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OH, NO: Third paragraph, the &quot;formal statement of the explanation  
</I>&gt;<i> of the solution to follow&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The AST operator nodes must combine the results of computing the  
</I>&gt;<i> value of their two subtrees.  They must perform a depth-first walk  
</I>&gt;<i> of the tree below them.  For fun and to make the operations more  
</I>&gt;<i> obvious, the operator nodes define left() and right() instead,  
</I>&gt;<i> making them appear even more different than the normal child- 
</I>&gt;<i> sibling tree representation.  Consequently, these expression trees  
</I>&gt;<i> can be treated as both homogeneous child-sibling trees and  
</I>&gt;<i> heterogeneous expression trees.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ??? Fun and obvious???  Make them appear more different???  A  
</I>&gt;<i> straight first example?  No.  More accurately an advanced  
</I>&gt;<i> transvestite example.
</I>
Did any of the examples or tutorials help?  The doc is not  
particularly friendly.

&gt;<i> There are so many issues working in this example, I challenge  
</I>&gt;<i> anyone not already an expert to readily tell what design features  
</I>&gt;<i> pertain to what -- what is there for fun and what select parts are  
</I>&gt;<i> essential for the particular purposes relevant to a relative new- 
</I>&gt;<i> comer's basic issues of understanding.  The question is, would  
</I>&gt;<i> someone not capable of authoring this example in the first place,  
</I>&gt;<i> now understand matters well enough to go back and author the  
</I>&gt;<i> simple, straight-forward version?
</I>
Sounds like we have a navigation issue not doc issue (though I plan  
on fixing the doc).  Did you see my course notes and all that jazz?

&gt;<i> Now, don't get me wrong: I am not advocating plodding  
</I>&gt;<i> documentation.  Enthusiasm is a great tool for maintaining interest  
</I>&gt;<i> in the narrative, particularly on paper.  There just needs to be  
</I>&gt;<i> something of a middle ground (at least for us middle of the road  
</I>&gt;<i> programmers).
</I>
Can you lay out precisely what you've read / looked at what you  
haven't?  That will tell me a lot!  As I say, it may be simply that  
the information is not available in the proper order or even defined  
in what order you should look.

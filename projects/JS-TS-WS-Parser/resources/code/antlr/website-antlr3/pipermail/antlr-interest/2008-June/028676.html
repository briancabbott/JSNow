I'm not sure &quot;added complexity&quot; is quite right; it's just putting 
the complexity at a different point.  For a statically-typed 
language you can make all the type decisions at &quot;compile time&quot; 
(ie. within ANTLR) -- or defer them until runtime if you 
prefer.  For a dynamically-typed language then you have to make 
the type decisions at runtime.  They're still the same decisions, 
though.

It's probably marginally easier to implement when your host 
language and custom language are both either static- or 
dynamic-typed; if there's a mismatch, you have to do a bit more 
work, but it's usually not too complicated.

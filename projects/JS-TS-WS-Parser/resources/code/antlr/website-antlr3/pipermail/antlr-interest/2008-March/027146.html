</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And just how is the tool supposed to know that that isn't what you want?
</I> &gt; Deus Ex Machina? :-) I see a lot of suggestions for warnings and errors
 &gt; and so on that surely seem reasonable to the requester, but in fact are
 &gt; specific to their particular situation. If you start spitting out 
warnings
 &gt; saying &quot;You don't have any ^ characters&quot;, all you are going to do is
 &gt; annoy those who know about that, and confuse those that don't. Further,
 &gt; other than giving a link to a precise article on tree construction, there
 &gt; isn't much information you can give out in a line or two of warnings.
 &gt; Further still, at what point does this warning go away? When there 
are two
 &gt; ^ characters? 7? One on every production? Perhaps you were trying to
 &gt; illustrate a point, but the example isn't a good one.
&gt;<i> 
</I>Theoretically one could introduce options to suppress certain warnings 
entirely. I suppose that one could categorize the warnings and say &quot;I'm 
not trying to do A, so warnings for not doing A are senseless to me.&quot;. 
Noting down an explicit opt-out would be also self-documenting. On the 
other side, it would result in having to think a bit about the actual 
goals, but that's not a bad thing. But I don't know enough about ANTLR 
and languages to tell if my idea is actually feasible.

Ter,

Errr, that's just fine, except that the __init__() method for the 
parser class is already defined in the Python code generator, as it 
is required to perform initialization when constructing a new 
instance in Python. Also, Python does not support overloading, so I 
can only have one __init__() method. So I'm afraid your suggestion 
wouldn't fly.

Of course, there are alternatives: I can define empty __preinit__() 
and __postinit__() methods in the base parsers (LLkParser class) in 
the Python runtime, that are called from the __init__() method in 
that base parser.
This LLkParser.__init__() method is actually called from the 
generated parser, so when I override the __preinit__() and 
__postinit__() methods in the actions outside the grammar rules the 
initialization is augmented in the required way.

Problem: this approach is not portable to inherited parsers, as 
there is no requirement in Python that the superclass initializer is 
called when initializing an instance of a subclass. Also, the built-
in super() function does not normally do what you think it would do; 
it can be very misleading and unreliable.

Therefore my request for how to make specific headers:
- header &quot;init&quot; { } is needed, but I do not actually need separate
  preinit and postinit, I guess. Otherwise it would be:
- header &quot;preinit&quot; { } and
- header &quot;postinit&quot; { }
- header { } is necessary as well, but that's already available.
- header &quot;post&quot; { } would be needed to add any code after the
  generated parser/lexer/treeparser class, for instance for self
  testing.

Regards,
Marq

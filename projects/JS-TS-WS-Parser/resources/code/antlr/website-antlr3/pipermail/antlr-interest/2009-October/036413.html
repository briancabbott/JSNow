<PRE>So, having a little spare time I did a little experimentation and all you need do is be careful how you specify your ranges. Here is a rule that matches lower case ID in EBCDIC compatible ways, but is still compatible with ASCII/Unicode. You can extrapolate for the rest.

 

ID : (&#8216;a&#8217;..&#8217;I&#8217; {} | &#8216;j&#8217;..&#8217;r&#8217; {} | &#8216;s&#8217;..&#8217;y&#8217; {} | &#8216;z&#8217; {})

 

Note that the empty actions are there to prevent ANTLR from merging the ranges assuming Unicode character points.

 

However, for the sake of performance, you might be better scrapping ranges altogether and generating a switch instead. ANTLR 3.2 C target does its best to generate switch() instead of table driven DFA or If() because the C compilers are usually excellent at optimizing switch() and it results in code that avoids CPU data cache misses (DFA tables). It would be trivial for you to encode that in your own Inlinable) function and use it as a gated predicate for your ID  rule.

 

Similar care with all your lexer rule specifications will result in EBCDIC compatible, portable C code being generated.

Well, you could pay me to make an EBCDIC version ;) However, there is in practice no problem with mixing this &#8211; I have done it before on zOS.

 

I think that you need to look at this in the opposite light in that it isn&#8217;t that ANTLR code isn&#8217;t portable, but your lexer specification (and the fact that EBCDIC is stupid).

 

Why are you specifying your rule as:

 

ID: &#8216;a&#8217;..&#8217;z&#8217;

 

When that is not a valid range in your target environment? 

 

Change the ranges to:

 

ID: &#8216;a&#8217;..&#8217;k&#8217; | &#8216;l&#8217;..&#8217;t&#8217; &#8230;

 

Or whatever the valid ranges are. ANLTR might be &#8216;clever&#8217; here and assuming ASCII, may merge those ranges, so you might need to fold the ranges into fragments and so on. However, if you rework your lexer rules, I am sure that this can be done in portable fashion that does not require ASCII assumptions within the compiler.

Thanks for the response, ...

Unfortunately, it won't work in our situation without major changes.  We already have legacy C code which is compiled with default/native, and while we can use a different compile option for the ANTLR generated code, I'm not sure if it's good moving forward with mixed compilation rules.

The argument remains that it means the generated C lexer code has to be compiled by an ASCII-based compiler which may not be that portable.

Best,
-Lego

The z/OS C compiler is able to compile in a mode where string and character
literals are treated as ISO-8859-1.

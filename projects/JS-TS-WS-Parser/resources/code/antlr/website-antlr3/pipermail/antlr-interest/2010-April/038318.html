<PRE>Hi,

I just ran into something a little odd. I'm using @init actions in some 
parser rules to stack some information and @after to pop it again. In 
the generated Java code, the @after action gets wrapped in an &quot;if ( 
state.backtracking==0 ) {...}&quot;, so that it only gets executed when other 
actions are being executed, not during lookahead. This is what I 
expected. But I noticed that the @init actions are executed 
unconditionally, including during lookahead. I didn't expect this. The 
result was a lot of junk on the stack when it went into a dfa. The fix 
was easy enough, just checking state.backtracking myself. But I was 
wondering if this is an Antlr bug or if it's supposed to work this way.

Ron

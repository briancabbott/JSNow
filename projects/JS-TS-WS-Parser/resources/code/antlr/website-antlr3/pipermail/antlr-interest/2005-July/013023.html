Hi Gary!  Nice to have you here.  Thanks for the questions.

First thing: within a few weeks I hope to refactor the Java.stg  
template file to be much smaller and easier to maintain, which would  
necessitate a change to your templates (well, if you wanted to say  
&quot;similar&quot;).

&gt;<i>   and I have a question about a couple of the classes:   
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLRFileStream and  ANTLRStringStream.  Just a quick note - I am  
</I>&gt;<i> not a real programmer, and I am just now  learning about java, so I  
</I>&gt;<i> may have completely missed the boat here (so please be kind if   
</I>&gt;<i> this is the case).
</I>
Yeah, I wanted to revisit those class names and functionality at some  
point, so please critique away!

&gt;<i> Within these classes is a method called &quot;public int mark()&quot;.  It  
</I>&gt;<i> looks like a useless  method since all it does is create a  
</I>&gt;<i> CharStreamState object, give it the data from .p,  .line,  
</I>&gt;<i> and .charPositionInLine, and then it just returns 0!
</I>
Excellent observation.  It turns out that there can only be one mark  
&quot;location&quot; in the current implementation; hence the marker number is  
always 0.  Later, when I add in syntactic predicates, we will need to  
make this more general.  For now, I opted for a more efficient  
implementation.

&gt;<i> Shouldn't it do something more, like save that state back into the  
</I>&gt;<i> variable markers?
</I>
It saves it into a variable (an array of size 1) and then reuses it  
in rewrite(m) where m is always 0.

&gt;<i> If not, then what method does save data into markers?  All I can  
</I>&gt;<i> see is that when the  object is initialized, it saves a blank  
</I>&gt;<i> CharStreamState into markers.  After that, I don't  see anything  
</I>&gt;<i> that puts more information into markers, so what is its purpose?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, rewind() gives us the ability to go to a particular mark  
</I>&gt;<i> within markers and set the  local variables to those values - but I  
</I>&gt;<i> cannot figure out where we ever set any information  in markers.
</I>
The marker is set in mark() and the instance variables are wacked and  
reset to the marker in rewind() :)

&gt;<i> FYI - I am looking at the code for antlr v3 ea4 (I think).  I  
</I>&gt;<i> clicked on a link to download  version ea5, but the name of the  
</I>&gt;<i> file that was actually downloaded was ea4.
</I>
That's pretty odd...sounds like a browser issue.  What does  
Tool.VERSION reveal?

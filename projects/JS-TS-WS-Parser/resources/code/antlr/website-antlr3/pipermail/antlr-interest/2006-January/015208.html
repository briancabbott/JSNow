</I>&gt;<i> #4  0x00000000004bdc3c in StageParser::lang ()

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, the problem seems to be that recover(), calls consume()

</I>&gt;<i> CircularQueue::removeItems() in debug mode, but the assert is a NOOP

</I>&gt;<i> there is an assumption that if an exception is thrown in an action, no
</I>&gt;<i> match has been made.  This is not the case in my circumstance.
</I>
Could you cut this down to an small example+input that demonstrates it
and send it to me so I can look at stuff offline (currently without
internet which is quite a bother..)

&gt;<i> Anyway, this seems to be a bug/hard to recognize issue in the C++
</I>&gt;<i> runtime.  Does anyone have any ideas on how to best deal with this?
</I>
You could try removing the assert and make removeItems just plain
return in those cases. The triggering of the assert sometimes points
at a problem in the grammar mostly related to rules matching nothing.
There are no clear pre/post conditons of many of these methods. As a
result I'm usually not really enthousiastic about changing something
without proper analysis.

Another (maybe better?) option is to override recover to check wether
the consume makes sense.

Throw something different than a semantic exception if that's an
option? And/or adapt the error handler for the case.

&gt;<i> Also, it has been about 7 years since I last used ANTLR and it STILL
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't appear have an option to set filename suffixes on generated
</I>&gt;<i> files for C++ output.  If I add such, would someone be willing to
</I>&gt;<i> accept/integrate?
</I>
If it's a clean patch (e.g. implementing a C++ file level option) then
it should not be a problem to include. I prefer unified diffs or send
me the (minimally) changed files (starting from the latest release
preferably)

Cheers,

Ric

Perl does something like that, but of course that only applies to  
changes to locally scoped variables when you embed code in regexes.
Stacking those guessing code blocks and executing the undo blocks on  
the way back would be the way to do, methinks.
If a user does something that absolutely should only happen once, one  
would assume that he tests for guessing mode anyway. We can't second  
guess them
there (as much as we wanted to ;))

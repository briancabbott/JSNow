<PRE>
I am doing my 1st antlr project (version 2.7.6).  I downloaded DmlSQL2/SQL2
and converted them from C++ to Java.  What I need to do is scan a string
containing (Oracle) SQL DML and extract all of the names of the tables that
are the targets of modifications (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE).  I
can't figure out how to get the table names.  Can someone give me some
suggestions?

Craig

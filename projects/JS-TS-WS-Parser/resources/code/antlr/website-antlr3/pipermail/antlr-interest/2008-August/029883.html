Well, it is possible to fix this behaviour, but ANTLR has to be 
bootstrapped first. Currently the tool is maintained in a ANTLR 2 
grammar, which has some limitations. Only if we have an ANTLR in an 
ANTLR 3 grammar, we can use grammar inheritance to adapt the target code 
recognition to recognize the comments correctly. I don't know when Ter 
will finish this task, but he said it was too much work to include it in 
3.1. Maybe he finishes it for 3.2?

P.S.: Please don't use another email to create a reply email and change 
the subject line to something different. There are people who use 
mailing list threading to order related emails in handy trees and not 
creating a an entirely new email for new subjects screws that up. Any 
good email client should allow to create a new email from any email 
address - Thunderbird can do this over a context menu.

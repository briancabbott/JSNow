<PRE>Hi Andreas,

probably you are not catching the lexer errors. You also need to 
override one of the error reporting methods in the lexer, e.g.:

@lexer::members {
     	
         public void emitErrorMessage(String msg) {
// ...
         }

         public void recover(RecognitionException re) {
// ...           reportError(re);
         }

}

Some errors you will not see because the parser tries to recover from 
them and does not log them or you will only see it in certain methods, 
look at the call tree to find out which method is always called and hook 
in there. If I remember correctly emitErrorMessage() is not always 
called in the lexer / parser. You can switch of recovering all together 
if you throw an exception in the reover method. The lexer imo does 
something weird last time I looked into the source code: it eats up 
characters until it finds one for which it can continue properly 
(consumes, moves the read pointer forward), we did not need the behavior 
(only eat up till a certain char, e.g.' \n').

BR,
Paul

&gt;<i> Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a grammar that I use for a custom virtual machine. In this machine,
</I>&gt;<i> we have our own custom syntax error reporting mechanism, which is tied
</I>&gt;<i> through the NetBeans platform using ANTLR. Recently, one of the members on
</I>&gt;<i> our development team noticed that &quot;some&quot; of the errors that ANTLR is dumping
</I>&gt;<i> to the command line are not properly being routed through our syntax error
</I>&gt;<i> reporting mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The thing is, though, we aren't doing anything special with our reporting.
</I>&gt;<i> As a test to see which errors are being routed and which are not, we
</I>&gt;<i> modified our mechanism to do the simplest possible thing:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> @Override
</I>&gt;<i>      public String getErrorMessage(RecognitionException re, String[]
</I>&gt;<i> tokenNames) {
</I>&gt;<i>          return super.getErrorMessage(re, tokenNames);
</I>&gt;<i>      }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      public String getTokenErrorDisplay(Token t) {
</I>&gt;<i>          return t.toString();
</I>&gt;<i>      }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (this goes in @parser:members).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Next, we generate the grammar and set breakpoints at the appropriate points.
</I>&gt;<i> As expected, if we add in errors into our DSL, the breakpoints hit and the
</I>&gt;<i> errors are caught. However, if we add certain kinds of errors (e.g., an
</I>&gt;<i> extra semicolon at the end of a line when there shouldn't be one), ANTLR
</I>&gt;<i> seems to dump the error to the command line but not report it through
</I>&gt;<i> getErrorMessage (the breakpoint is not hit). For example, ANTLR might
</I>&gt;<i> output: line 15:24 no viable alternative at character ';' but not actually
</I>&gt;<i> route this through getErrorMessage, which means we don't detect it
</I>&gt;<i> programmatically.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, what exactly is going on here? Are there certain classifications of
</I>&gt;<i> errors that ANTLR dumps to the command line but does not route through
</I>&gt;<i> getErrorMessage? For these classes of errors, how can we force ANTLR to send
</I>&gt;<i> us these as well, so that we can route them correctly through the rest of
</I>&gt;<i> our architecture?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I tried using @rulecatch and a few other methods in BaseRecognizer (e.g.,
</I>&gt;<i> emit, reportError), according to the docs, but I can't seem to get ANTLR to
</I>&gt;<i> route these particular errors through there either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts?

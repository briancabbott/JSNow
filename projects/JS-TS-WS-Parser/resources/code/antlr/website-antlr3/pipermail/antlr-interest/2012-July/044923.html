<PRE>Hi,

and thank you for your reply.

If I just call the 'actorName', then once I write the actual syntax and replace 'actorName' with a value, (e.g. 'Doctor'), the parser will not be able to distinguish if it is the actorName of the PrimaryActor or the actorName of the SecondaryActor. Both 'primaryActor' and 'secondaryActor' have an actorName of the same type.&#160;I don't want to create an actorName for each one of them but being able to distinguish the actorName (sub-rule/token) through its including rule.&#160;

&#160;
Thank you,

Marinos

Hello,
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I am new to ANTLR, so I am trying to learn the basics.&#160;
</I>&gt;<i>I would like to know how I can call a rule or token which is defined within another rule, as in the example below:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>description
</I>&gt;:<i>'Description' ':' primaryActor.actorName ......
</I>&gt;<i>;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>primaryActor
</I>&gt;:<i>actorName PA_TYPE
</I>&gt;<i>;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>secondaryActor
</I>&gt;:<i>actorName | SA_TYPE
</I>&gt;<i>;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>actorName
</I>&gt;:<i>ARTICLE SMALL_NOUN
</I>&gt;<i>;
</I>&gt;<i>So, 'primaryActor' and 'secondaryActor' both have an 'actorName'. When the user will write the actual syntax &quot;e.g. 'Description: a Doctor...&quot;, 'Doctor should be assigned to 'primaryActor.actorName. Because 'actorName' is of the same type for both primary and secondary actors, I don't want to create an actorName for each one of them but being able to distinguish the actorName (sub-rule/token) through its &#160;including rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>

I don't quite follow. If you want to match an `actorName`, why would you want to write `primaryActor.actorName` (which isn't possible, btw) instead of just writing `actorName` like this:


description
:<i>'Description' ':' actorName
</I>;

Regards,

Bart.

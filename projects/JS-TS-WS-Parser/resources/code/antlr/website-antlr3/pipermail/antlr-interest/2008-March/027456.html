<PRE>Hallo,

 

I'm new to the list. I'm trying to use ANTLR for generating a SQL parser
because our current parser doesn't support Unicode input - it was generated
by Lex/Yacc. We use C++ and we have our own complex AST that is used by a
SQL engine already... So my idea is to write a tree adapter that would
create our existing AST nodes (they would just inherit ANTLR tree
interface).

 

And here comes a problem that ANTLR 3.x doesn't contain support for &quot;pure&quot;
C++ implementation. I've just found Jim Idle's &quot;promise&quot;:

 

&gt;<i> Later I may well produce a complete C++ implementation from scratch,
</I>
&gt;<i> however, at this point I am not sure that it buys you anything. Please
</I>
&gt;<i> let me know if there are things you cannot do with the system as it
</I>
&gt;<i> stands (other than access the tokens and so on using C++ objects, which
</I>
&gt;<i> will be done later). 
</I>
 

I know that the problem could be solved with the current system somehow, but
it would be probably very ugly. So yes, complete C++ implementation will buy
us something! Or we can use ANTLR 2.x.

 

Right now we will probably try to build the AST by hand:

 

atom returns [OurNode* result]

@init { $result = NULL; }

:<i>              NUMBER
</I>
                {

                               std::string str((char*)$NUMBER.text-&gt;chars,
$NUMBER.text-&gt;len);

                               $result = new OurNumberNode(str);

                };

 

Or do you have some other ideas?

 

Thanks

 

Tom

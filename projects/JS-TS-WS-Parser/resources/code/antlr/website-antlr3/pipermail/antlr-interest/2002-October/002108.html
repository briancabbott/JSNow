Howdy. Yeah, the doc is pretty much just a &quot;core dump&quot; w/o regards to 
flow.  more of a reference manual if you're already &quot;in the know&quot;. :(

&gt;<i> Of course, you can't explain everything back to the beginning of the 
</I>&gt;<i> world,
</I>&gt;<i> but it is certainly possible to say, &quot;an introduction to X is out of 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> scope of this document, here are some good sources to learn about X&quot;.
</I>
I'm hoping that when I start up on the book again in January 2003 (yep 
in a few months...gotta start teaching a grad language course) that it 
will provide the background so that the reference manual will make more 
sense.

&gt;<i> I have really come to appreciate ANTLR as an excellent tool, and have 
</I>&gt;<i> also
</I>&gt;<i> gotten good information from the docs, so I hope my remarks don't sound
</I>&gt;<i> cranky.  I do believe that ANTLR would profit immensely from an 
</I>&gt;<i> orderly,
</I>&gt;<i> clear exposition.  In my dreams I imagine something like an O'Reilly 
</I>&gt;<i> book...
</I>&gt;<i> a solid O'Reilly book on ANTLR would really make the power of this tool
</I>&gt;<i> accessible to the wide audience it deserves.
</I>
Yep, perhaps my rework of the doc will be sufficiently good to make it 
a real book.  My language book will be a &quot;magnus opus&quot; and take me 
probably 2 more years after I start again.  The ref book could be done 
quickly.  I'm converting to TML (Terence's Markup Language) as we 
speak.  From that I can gen HTML, PDF, etc... in nice format so I'll 
look at how far off from a book the doc is.  I'm guessing pretty far :(

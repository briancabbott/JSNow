<PRE>It would take a bit of work to reconfigure my environment to to go back
to 2.7.2.1. I didn't do any performance testing when I upgraded. I
haven't been concentrating too much on performance of parsing right now
since usually the execution of a query swamps the parsing. I did have
some bad performance when I was using syntactic predicates. But I was
able to refactor and get rid of any recursive ones.

If what your interested in is performance between queueing and reusing
the ASPPairs and just always &quot;new&quot;ing them I did a little experiment.

We are using the latest 2.0 release of .net so I recompiled the C#
runtime as shipped to be fair. Plus I compiled a version with
ASTPair.GetInstance() just returning new ASTPair(). And PutInstance just
doing nothing. I compiled optimized versions (you have to force it in
nant in 2.0).

I mad a performance bench mark that parsed 1000 queries. It took 10.38
seconds as shipped and 10.21 seconds letting the garbage collector do
its thing.

I also put it into a bigger loop and watched the performance counters
after 1 minute of execution.

The reuse version (as shipped) spent 0.497% of the cpu time in the
garbage collector and did 264 Generation 0 collections and 36 Generation
1

The &quot;new&quot; version spent 0.527% of the cpu time in the garbage collector
and did 338 Generation 0 collections and 41 Generation 1

So the garbage collector does have to work a little harder but it does
it more effeciently than doing the management and reuse manually using
the Queue. I am finding the more I use C# the more I love it and hate
going back to our unmanaged C++ code where you have to worry so much
about memory management. I also spent some time at the Microsoft lab
tracking how the JIT compiler generated code. Does it ever do a good job
inlining methods and minimizing stack frames.

The memory usage was about the same. ANTLR's usage is swamped by other
things allocated in our engine.

One disadvantage of keeping free nodes on the Queue is that when the
parsing is idle (between queries) the memory used by the &quot;free&quot; ASTPairs
is tied up and can not be reclaimed by the garbage collector. They can
only ever be reused as ASTPairs. Probably not that many of the in
practice. If there were the Queue implementation gets not very friendly
because it keeps growing a fixed size array (allocating a bigger one and
copying everything over). Big arrays are not very friendly to the memory
management and paging. I assume here you wouldn't expect the queue to
get much bigger than 100 entries even if there are pultiple parser
instances running.

The Multithreading bug is one of those hard to recreate ones. It will
just about never happen on a single CPU machine because you would need
to have a time slice in the middel of the critical code. And only on a
multi CPU machine under very heavy loading. The kind you hate to come
across in the field! I have had 20 years of working on multi-cpu
machines and it is always interesting the bugs and scaling issues that
come up. I have become very careful with static variables.


Jordan, have you done benchmarks with and without the queue? I notice
the Java implementation doesn't use one.

Jim

&gt;<i> We use ANTLR to parse our query language in our data server. 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a multi user system so we service many simultaneous requests. 
</I>&gt;<i> It is a .NET product so we use C# as the language.
</I>&gt;<i> We have been using 2.7.2.1 for quite a while and I finally got around 
</I>&gt;<i> to moving up to 2.7.5 a few weeks ago.
</I>
Jim, can you comment on the relative performance of 2.7.2.1 and 2.7.5 in
your environment  please?

Cheers,

Micheal
ANTLR/C#

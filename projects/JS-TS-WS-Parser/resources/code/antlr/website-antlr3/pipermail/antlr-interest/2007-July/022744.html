<PRE>
For a grammar I've been working on, the lexer file generated for
&quot;language=CSharp&quot; is over 100 times as large as that generated when
&quot;language=Java&quot;. The C# lexer file size 26 MB (26,019,532) whereas the
Java lexer file is 240 KB (240,282). Obviously such a huge file taxes
the C# compiler (amazingly, it does build, but ever so slowly).

The size difference seems to be, at least in part, in the way the &quot;DFA
transition&quot; tables are generated. For Java these tables are generated as
Strings; for C# they're generated as arrays of shorts. There may be
other contributors to the size difference as well.

It seems peculiar that there would be such a huge difference in
generated source code size for 2 targets that are so similar. Is there
any possibility of reducing the size of the generated C# lexer code?

Thanks,
John

<PRE>Here are a few debugging ideas as I've seen each of these issues before...

1. Try increasing the heap memory for Java on the command line. e.g. to increase to 1GB use: java -Xmx1024M -jar antlrworks-1.3.1.jar

2. Check if you are really using the Sun Java JRE/JDK on Ubuntu Linux (this will give you the right idea: <A HREF="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-ubuntu-linux-install-configure-jdk-jre">http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-ubuntu-linux-install-configure-jdk-jre</A>) . If multiple alternatives are installed you might not be... Using another JRE/JDK could be the cause of your problems.

3. Run antlrworks by command line from a terminal. If you have any 'out of memory' errors you will see console messages in the Ubuntu terminal you executed it from.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Issue with antlrworks 1.3.1 and JDK 1.6
&#160;&#160;&#160; update 17?
To: <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">antlr-interest at antlr.org</A>

&#160;&#160;&#160; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">ee970b291001060333j78fde473nfc0efad9fa93b03f at mail.gmail.com</A>&gt;

I did a recent round of upgrading software on my machines (real and virtual)
and somewhere in the process I've got ANTLRworks in unusable shape.&#160; (I
tried reporting this through the antlr.org web site but it doesn't seem to
have taken.)

On *every* machine I have access to (both real and virtual, running Windows
XP or Linux) I get the following pretty nasty behaviour:

&#160;&#160;&#160;1. *java -jar antlrworks.jar* (I can also use javaw on Windows for a
&#160;&#160;&#160;similar, more annoying effect.)
&#160;&#160;&#160;2. *The splash screen pops up briefly.*
&#160;&#160;&#160;3. *The &quot;New Document&quot; dialogue replaces it.*
&#160;&#160;&#160;4. I hit &quot;Cancel&quot; (or alternatively press &quot;Esc&quot; on the keyboard).

At this point, no matter the platform, no matter what I try, I have a dead
executable until I hit Ctrl+C (or, if I used javaw, I kill it in the task
manager).&#160; I've tried this on Ubuntu 9.04, on Slackware 13.0 (virtualized),
on Windows XP (four different machines, one virtualized) and get this
behaviour consistently.&#160; Whatever's supposed to happen when I cancel the new
document dialogue freezes and can only unfreeze through lethal injection of
Ctrl+C.&#160; (There are, of course, no messages on the console that could tell
me what's going on.)

The behaviour on Windows after this if I choose &quot;OK&quot; is acceptable.&#160; Up
comes the wizard for a new project which works normally and, more
importantly, can be cancelled and gets me into the ANTLRworks GUI.&#160; It's a
bit obnoxious having to go that route, but it works.&#160; If I choose to use the
wizard everything works as expected.

The behaviour on Linux is less acceptable.&#160; The new project wizard pops up
but the text input focus is on ANTLRworks' editor window and CANNOT be put
into the wizard at all on any spot.&#160; I have to cancel the wizard to get to
the main window (which then works as expected).&#160; This also happens if I go
File -&gt; New from the main window: I simply cannot get text input into any
field of the new project wizard.

The last time I did anything with ANTLRworks was v1.3.0 using JDK 1.6 update
16.&#160; I did not see this behaviour then at all, so something has happened
between then and now.

Any advice for debugging this further?

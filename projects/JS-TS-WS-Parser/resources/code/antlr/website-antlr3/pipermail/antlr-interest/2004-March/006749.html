Hi Robin,

Yeah, the code sucks.  However, I believe my comments and intentions 
align in the code included below.  The situation you are manipulating 
is this: you need FOLLOW(r) and there is a cached value there.  If 
there is a complete value (i.e., no cycles indicating partial 
computations), then can just return the value.  Else, we pull out the 
name of the rule, r2, whose FOLLOW was attempted but failed due to 
cycle, leaving FOLLOW(r) partially computed.  We go to the FOLLOW(r2) 
computation cache and see if it has a value.  If no value then it must 
still be being computed (I believe that means that FOLLOW(r2) depends 
on FOLLOW(r) which depends on FOLLOW(r2).  It is my *intention* that a 
cycle cannot occur unless a computation is in progress.  So finding an 
empty cache value means you still can't complete this computation.  
Now, it could be that I'm not properly updating the cache or removing 
the cycles from the cache.  It is more likely that I have a bug 
elsewhere and your patch merely forces FOLLOW computation to begin 
anew.  It may work in your case, but I'm just not sure about the 
general solution without spending hours to regrok all this spaghetti.  
It seems to me though that your

                 end.cache[k] = FOLLOW (k, re);

may not be completely correct.  It would replace FOLLOW(r) with purely 
FOLLOW(r2), when in fact I designed the cache to store partial 
computations and cycles so you may be blowing away any partial results. 
  Since FOLLOW(r)==FOLLOW(r2) semantically you might be ok, but in the 
code I'm not sure all the pieces of FOLLOW(r) would be cobbled together 
properly.  Hmm...I might believe FOLLOW(k, end), however.  Can you send 
me your test case you used to narrow this down or did you just look at 
the code?  I found the same problem in my python front end recently but 
couldn't get a small test case for some reason.

         // Check to see if there is cached value
         if (end.cache[k] != null) {
             if (DEBUG_ANALYZER) {
                 System.out.println(&quot;cache entry FOLLOW(&quot; + k + &quot;) for &quot; 
+ rule + &quot;: &quot; + end.cache[k].toString(&quot;,&quot;, charFormatter, grammar));
             }
             // if the cache is a complete computation then simply 
return entry
             if (end.cache[k].cycle == null) {
                 return (Lookahead)end.cache[k].clone();
             }
             // A cache entry exists, but it is a reference to a cyclic 
computation.
             RuleSymbol rs = 
(RuleSymbol)grammar.getSymbol(end.cache[k].cycle);
             RuleEndElement re = rs.getBlock().endNode;
             // The other entry may not exist because it is still being
             // computed when this cycle cache entry was found here.
             if (re.cache[k] == null) {
                 // return the cycle...that's all we can do at the 
moment.
                 return (Lookahead)end.cache[k].clone();
             }
             else {
                 // replace this cache entry with the entry from the 
referenced computation.
                 // Eventually, this percolates a complete (no cycle 
reference) cache entry
                 // to this node (or at least gets it closer and 
closer).  This is not
                 // crucial, but makes cache lookup faster as we might 
have to look up
                 // lots of cycle references before finding a complete 
reference.
                 end.cache[k] = re.cache[k];
                 // Return the cache entry associated with the cycle 
reference.
                 return (Lookahead)re.cache[k].clone();
             }
         }

Thanks a million for tracking this...if we can find the &quot;right&quot; fix 
then I'll put in 2.7.3.

Best regards,
Terence

Yes - I keep trying to tell people not to rely on @after in the C target
as the seeming fix to just move it about in the C.stg isn't quite a
simple as it looks because there are many dependencies on what you have
in there (predicates, backtrack, scopes and so on). I do need to
schedule proper time to look at this and see if this is fixable such
that it does everything in the right order in all combinations, but that
time won't be until next week right now.

Please upgrade to 3.1.1 when it comes out later today by the way. In the
main, this update removes dup() code in tree builders that was there for
the beta and should not have been left in 3.1 as it causes huge memory
consumption and so on.

<PRE>I think those two problems could be solved with a filter between the lexer
and parser.  Consider this approach:

buffer a whole line
upon recognizing a newline, work backwards to see if there was a comment at
the end of the line by looking for '*', '!', or &quot;REM&quot;.  If you see a ';'
then stop looking for a comment
discard the comment

now do a similar thing for a label following a ';'

What do you think?

Hello Monty,

Yes i also tried to figure out a way to do this in the parser but did not 
quite get as far as you have.  Firstly the technique seemed to produce alot 
of ambiguity warnings which i could have silenced but was worried that i 
might miss something important by doing so.  This was only cosmetic though, 
the main problem  that i just could not solve using the above method was 
with the way comments worked:

1) Comments can begin at start of line, after a label or after a semi colon
2) Semi colons can also be used in argument lists, to shortcut optional
params
3) Comments are started by '*' or '!' or 'REM'

I noticed in your solution you removed comments in the lexer, problems come 
from the above rules trying to parse something like:

A = INSERT(B, C ; REM) ; REM A comment

...the first REM is a variable the second REM is the start of a 
comment.  The problem was the lexer didn't know enough to distinguish 
between the 2 cases.  I considered letting comments flow through to the 
parser to solve this but all sorts of junk that wont even lex gets put into 
them.

Similar example with '*' comment char:
A = INSERT(B, C; 1 * 2); 1 * 2

The first '1 * 2' is a straight multiply, the second is a label '1' 
followed by a comment 2.

In the end i was forced into doing the work in the lexer, maintaining 
states, which was ugly but which gave me a relatively clean parser grammer.

PS I just checked the above 2 cases with the current grammer, and they 
don't quite work...need to add something to track bracket depth in the 
lexer aaarrghh!

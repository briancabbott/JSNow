With C++ I'm more and more leaning to C++-ifying them. But this is mostly
because C++ has some more powerfull things to do some stuff (with
templates). Which in the end will be necessary for Unicode support (I
think). If the java way is enough like the .Net way then I would leave it
as java'ish as possible saves time in porting over new stuff/fixes from the
java mode.

I think I kludged around something similar in the C++ codegen. Think I did
it with AST declarations. My fix is d*mn ugly though. We need a different
codegenerator setup.

My problem was that after delaying declarations, I sometimes hid a previous
declaration which yielded 'real usefull'(tm) trees. Look for genASTdecl and
needASTdecl func/vars in CppCodegenerator.java.

_saveIndex maybe tougher though to tackle. You may need to scan ahead in
grammar elements (eeiew)

&gt;<i> 5. I would like to allow the users to be able to specify a C# 
</I>&gt;<i> namespace to be used by default for all the 
</I>&gt;<i> lexers/parsers/treeparsers defined in a *.g file. I would also like a

</I>
There's some namespace stuff in the C++ mode. Dunno if it's usable for your
problem. Maybe it's possible to share some code between C++/C# mode.

&gt;<i> Finally, how do I get this into ANTLR?. Just mail it to Terrence is 
</I>&gt;<i> it?
</I>
Good choice ;)

Cheers,

Ric

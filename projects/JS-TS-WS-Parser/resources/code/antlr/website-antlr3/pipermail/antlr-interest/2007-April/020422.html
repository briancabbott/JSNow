<PRE>Do you have a specific need for C++? You could just declare the C
functions you need as extern &quot;C&quot;. In fact, I should really add that to
the C output so that it just happens by including the generated .h file.
Though I suppose the fact that you can use C++ in actions is attractive
- I ought to play with this, perhaps you can just compile the output as
C++ and use C++ in actions anyway... why do I keep making more work for
myself? ;-)

C examples are now up to date and include VS2005 .sln and projects and
have been tested to death with DevPartner studio (though I don't have
complete coverage yet). A lot of work went into getting
backtrack/memorization to work without the enormous overhead it could be
with 2MB java input files :-).

If you are using the C target, you need to use a .jar that predates
Ter's recent tree rewrite stuff... however you also need the latest
template. I am working on the tree re-write stuff now, so possibly by
the end of the weekend it will be back in sync. I will post if it is.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Problems with C++-target

Hi!

Using a small grammar with antlr 3.0b7 that generates Java-files without
problems I tried the language option Cpp. and get the following error
message:

--------

error(10):  internal error: group Cpp does not satisfy interface
ANTLRCore: missing templates [parameterSetAttributeRef,

A similar error war reported on April 7th for the C target where it was
suggested to use the latest daily build. The latest I could find on the
page was dated April 21st and still exhibits this error.

Any ideas what I should do? Thanks in advance for any advice!

Best regards,

Marc

Yeah, that's cool. The ast_suffix ruleref seems to be present in all  
relevant places.

&gt;<i> Any rule that has a bang modifier must Create a local string to

</I>
The change to emit should be easy, but I have one conceptual problem  
with the bang modifier and the placement of the code after the match  
code:

Suppose I have the following lexer rule:

FOO	:	'&quot;'! ID '&quot;'!	;

with ID being some canonical ID-rule.

I'm seeing the ast_suffix.type==ANTLRParser.BANG in the rule 'atom'  
of codegen.g. But I also need to add code to the FOO lexer rule to  
set up
the local string buffer to collect the chars from the ID subrule.  
Simply adding code to the charRef ST (or rather using the new  
charRefBang) after
the match won't do it.
Now if I'd written &quot;FOO! : ... &quot; I'd be all set, but if the bang  
occurs in of the atoms inside the rule I have to look inside first  
and instantiate
the appropriate ST for this. The one with the string buffer setup code.

Any ideas?

Of course I don't use syntactic predicates in the interpreter.
A quick solution would be to overload the match function
for my interpreter class. Maybe that is the easiest and savest.
An empty function body probably gets optimized out anyway.
After having a quick look at the code generator, I realized,
that I am much better of, if I hack the interpreter instead :-)
Thanks for your replies,

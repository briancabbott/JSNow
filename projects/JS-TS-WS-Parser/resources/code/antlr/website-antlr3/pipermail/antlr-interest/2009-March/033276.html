Andreas--

After doing some research on the web, I have to believe that ABAP is one of those horrible languages created by the clueless for the masochistic and easily victimized.&#160; I think that most of the 800 keywords you describe are probably function names or the equivalent and that the lack of a formal description for the language leads to a considerable confusion of syntax with semantics.&#160; It does not help that SQL is embedded as a first class part of the language.

My advice is to back way off and try to abstract ABAP syntax, identifying as few keywords as possible.&#160; &quot;DO&quot; and &quot;WHILE&quot;, for example, are clearly keywords, but &quot;WRITE&quot; is an identifier that names a function.&#160; Defer as much semantic processing to later passes as possible.&#160; Except for the embedded SQL, I suspect that ABAP is not much more complicated than Java:&#160; it just has not been properly codified.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [antlr-interest] Prediction DFA bug?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> some days ago there was a discussion on how to solve the identifier vs. keyword 
</I>&gt;<i> problem. Some said it's not feasible to have 800 individual keyword tokens, and 
</I>&gt;<i> one should rather partition the token set into &quot;supertokens&quot; representing (lets 
</I>&gt;<i> say) 40 tokens, or even only have one &quot;keyword&quot; token. Some weeks ago I tried 
</I>&gt;<i> already, with an extreme approach, namely every keyword is an ID token + 
</I>&gt;<i> semantic predicates. The produced parser had some strange properties, namely, it 
</I>&gt;<i> was misled into wrong rules, and then complained about mismatched keywords, ie, 
</I>&gt;<i> while looking for a statement beginning with keyword_1, it decided to go for the 
</I>&gt;<i> statement rule beginning with keyword_2, which in turn raised a 
</I>&gt;<i> PredicateFailedException:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> keyword_2: {is_keyword2()}? IDENTIFIER;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I quickly put this attempt into my archive and tried again with the 800 keyword 
</I>&gt;<i> tokens approach, which also did not work (timeout because of huge prediction 
</I>&gt;<i> DFAs). Now, after the discussion yesterday on this list, I again looked at the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;supertoken&quot; approach, but now I did it more &quot;hybrid&quot;, namely with two tokens: 
</I>&gt;<i> ID and KEYWORD --- with limited success. I have simplified the original grammar 
</I>&gt;<i> a lot, so that it only contains few lines of code and is self-contained (can be 
</I>&gt;<i> debugged in ANTLRworks). The error/issue/behaviour-producing input is also 
</I>&gt;<i> attached (XXXTEST.abap).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is the problem, as I see it:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> program
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; :&#160; statements&#160; EOF
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> statements
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; :&#160; ( statement PERIOD&#160; ) *&#160; &#160; ;
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; // here the parser see's a KEYWORD token, and wants to further disambiguate by 
</I>&gt;<i> looking ahead
</I>&gt;<i> statement
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; // somehow, on input KEYWORD ID KEYWORD ID, the parser is attracted into 
</I>&gt;<i> this alternative,
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; // because it only considers the lookahead KEYWORD ID KEYWORD ...
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; : kw_stmt2^&#160; id kw_abc
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; // .. although it should take this path, on input KEYWORD ID KEYWORD ID 
</I>&gt;<i> PERIOD:
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; | kw_stmt1^&#160; rule
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; | kw_stmt3^&#160; id
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> rule
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; : id&#160; xyz*
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> xyz&#160; &#160; &#160; : kw_xyz^ id
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> id&#160; : ID
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; | KEYWORD
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> kw_stmt1: {getKeywordType( input.LT(1) ) == KW_STMT1}? KEYWORD -&gt; KW_STMT1;
</I>&gt;<i> ....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, one could advise to switch the semantic lookahead into a gated semantic 
</I>&gt;<i> lookahead:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> kw_stmt1: {getKeywordType( input.LT(1) ) == KW_STMT1}?=&gt; KEYWORD -&gt; KW_STMT1;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This in fact solves the above problem, so what? When using the 
</I>&gt;<i> gated-semantic-predicate approach in my original grammar, with 800 of these 
</I>&gt;<i> keyword distinguishing rules (note: rules! not tokens), however, this again 
</I>&gt;<i> leads to timeouts in exactly the same rule as with the original 800 individual 
</I>&gt;<i> keyword tokens. It must be due to the size of some automaton, and it seems to 
</I>&gt;<i> grow not because of the number of tokens, but because of the number of 
</I>&gt;<i> rules+attached gated semantic predicates.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sorry that currently I dont have small or at least synthetic grammar that 
</I>&gt;<i> also demonstrates my timeout issue, but I think that the above behaviour is in 
</I>&gt;<i> itself interesting, or (so to say) not correct, regardless of what problem I am 
</I>&gt;<i> trying to solve with it. My opinion is that ANTLR should somehow use a larger 
</I>&gt;<i> lookahead in the situation above. I would really like to dive into ANTLR source 
</I>&gt;<i> code and check for myself, but are somewhat overwhelmed by its complexity ... it 
</I>&gt;<i> seems that LL(*) is built on a simple idea, but to implement it with all corner 
</I>&gt;<i> cases, takes a lot of effort.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Andreas Meyer

<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; The latter really should be handled by the tool as it can have a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; serious impact on lexer performance if done inefficiently.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I'm lacking imagination, but in what parsing task do 
</I>&gt;<i> you actually expect that counting lines/offsets is a 
</I>&gt;<i> significant performance bottleneck?
</I>
In all tasks that need lines/col/offset counting and care about performace
actually. My point is that how it is implemented can have a serious impact
on performance. At the lexer level, you would want to reduce the number of
times each character is &quot;processed&quot; or &quot;touched&quot; and the duration of the
processing to the absolute minimum. Short of editing generated code, I can't
see how that can be achieved optimally if the generator isn't generating the
tracking code as part of the lexer's core.

&gt;<i> I really can't imagine 
</I>&gt;<i> anything complex enough to justify using something like ANTLR 
</I>&gt;<i> but so trivial that line counting might give significant 
</I>&gt;<i> performance differences.
</I>
I can. Attempting to tack on line/col/offset counting to a lexer via virtual
method overrides for instance.

&gt;<i> About the virtual methods: maybe some C++ crack might be able 
</I>&gt;<i> to change the ANTLR C++ code creation and move lots of the 
</I>&gt;<i> stuff now handled by virtual functions into some template 
</I>&gt;<i> magic. That would of course ruin compatibility with old 
</I>&gt;<i> compilers, so probably both modes should be available.
</I>
My comments also extend to the Java/C# targets. Virtual methods cost more
than non-virtual methods. This probably isn't a worry in the general case...

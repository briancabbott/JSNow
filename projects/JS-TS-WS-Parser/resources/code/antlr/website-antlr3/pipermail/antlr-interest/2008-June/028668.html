 I also thought that disk I/O would be the limiting factor.  But I'm not
sure that this is as true as it used to be.  There are the network attached
storage and high speed RAID disk systems which support very high performance
disk access.  We are also starting to see the emergence of flash based
disk.  These factors are starting to change the way databases are looked at.

  Again, I think this is sort of a moot issue since in general, with
parallel make, compiles are fast enough for most people.  Throwing parallel
technology at it doesn't seem to be warranted.  But it's still interesting
to think about how one would do it if it were justified.

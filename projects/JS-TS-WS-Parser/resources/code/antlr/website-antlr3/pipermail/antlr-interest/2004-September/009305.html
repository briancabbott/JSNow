Thanks for the response.  I didn't really want to install cygwin or the JRE
though.  I'm going to be using ANTLR in a mass distribution to an
environment where C# is the only available tool.

I found JET, which produces a real standalone.  As a fringe benefit it is
supposed to be faster also, although I didn't test it for speed.  I went to
the trouble of producing a standalone using their trial version and I made
it available to the mailing list here.  It is not legal for any organization
to use though.

JET is really expensive.  I left a message for the JET people asking for a
free version that leaves the advertising blurb in the installer.  I think
they should go for it since it will give a lot of free advertising.

I was hoping that one of the thousand subscribers to this mailing list would
already have a JET license and offer to make a JET installer for ANTLR, but
no one has bit yet.

It just occurred to me, is there a way to wrap a cygwin binary into a
transparent .exe installer like JET does with their Java interpreter?  That
would accomplish the same goal.  My real requirement is just to be able to
install ANTLR with a single click.

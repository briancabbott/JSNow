<PRE>I see. I originally got the &quot;bootstrap&quot; release, which does not include ST3. Then when I went to get ST3 after I discovered I needed it for Antlr generated StringTemplate code, I got it from the StringTemplate website. Hence the incompatibility.

Would you mind if I edited the Wiki Page for the C# target to make all of this a little more clear to the uninitiated?

Hi Andy,

The Antlr3.Runtime.dll included in all of the packages is exactly the same. It's used by ST3, ST4, the Tool, and the generated grammars for both the CSharp2 and CSharp3 targets.

Subject: StringTemplate and Antrl3.runtime version mess on C# target

I've done some further investigation on this problem, and it seems that it wasn't quite what I thought it was. As I suspected, it was connected to my recent efforts to use Antlr generated StringTemplate code. I hadn't done this previously because Antlr3.4 uses StringTemplate 4 for its own purposes, but generates code that expects to use StringTemplate 3 if you use Antlr to StringTemplate integration.
The problem is that I apparently need a different version of Antlr3.Runtime.dll to run the C# code generated by Antlr3.exe than I need to run StringTemplate 3, which that same generated code expects to use.
I got the version of Antlr3.Runtime.dll that StringTemplate3 expects from the StringTemplate site, and tried to add that to my project along with the version of Antlr.Runtime.dll that the generated C# code expects, but Visual Studio doesn't like it.
What a mess! How do I resolve this? And I'm mystified, since it seems that anyone who tries to use the latest version of the C# target and also wants to have Antlr generate StringTemplate code will run into this problem.

I thought I had things working based on the fix below. I ran Antlr, and compiled a project based on its output without error. However, when I try to run the project, I get:

An unhandled exception of type 'System.IO.FileLoadException' occurred in Tree1.exe

Additional information: Could not load file or assembly 'Antlr3.Runtime, Version=3.3.0.7239, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=eb42632606e9261f' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)

Do I need to somehow rebuild/update the DLL so I can run it? Is it a .NET security thing that refuses to use the modified .stg files? And somehow when Antlr3.exe runs, it get around this?

Hi Andy!

This is a know bug. Read

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying to collect all the StringTemplates created by all instances of one rule (borg) into a StringTemplate for a containing rule (prog). But I can't seem to find the right syntax:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> options {
</I>&gt;<i>        output = template;
</I>&gt;<i>        language = CSharp3;
</I>&gt;<i>      tokenVocab=Tree1;

</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> public prog
</I>&gt;<i> : (b+=borg)+ -&gt; template(vals = {$b})
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;&lt;
</I>&gt;<i> { // prog
</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;vals; separator = &quot;,&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The syntax I tried above is one many approaches I've tried - none seem to work. Antlr3 runs without error but the code won't compile. I hope the intent is clear, as it is a pretty simple example. I've looked back and forth in Terence's book trying to find something like this, and in the examples, but so far I've struck out. It seems like a very common thing to try to do!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One strange thing is that when I look at the generated code, the list for b (list_b) is declared as List&lt;CommonTree&gt;. But Terence's books says is should be List&lt;StringTemplate&gt; when the output type is template. Later in the generated code, when it tries to add to the list, it tries to create a List&lt;StringTemplate&gt;, which seems right, but causes a compiler error. It almost seems like a bug, but I probably just don't understand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can anyone help me with this?
</I>&gt;<i>

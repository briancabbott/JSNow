<PRE>Look, I was giving an analogy. I KNOW it's not pseudocode.

The point that I think others' are getting concerned over is that
&quot;pseudocode&quot; is, by all commonly accepted definition, not a formal way to
write things. Anyone trying to talk about a &quot;formal pseudocode&quot; is distoring
the meaning of the word, and actually means a &quot;scripting language that has
no software and cannot be used&quot;.

If your language is truly &quot;pseudocode&quot;, then it is by definition not
standardized and cannot be processed any more than the English language can
be. If you CAN process your language with strict rules and syntax, then it
is not truly &quot;pseudocode&quot;.

It's a terminology thing. It is as if you were saying: &quot;I want to translate
a portrait painting into a German book.&quot;

&gt;<i> My question is simply is anyone here has done this exercice ?
</I>
Trust me on this one, try asking:
&quot;Can anyone offer me tips on
creating an automatic translator so that I can turn my custom language
into source code in another language. My custom language is most
similar to [name
of an existing scripting or programming language].&quot;

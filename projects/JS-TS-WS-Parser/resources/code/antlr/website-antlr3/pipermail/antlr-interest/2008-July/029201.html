Personally I think that that construct is almost unreadable and it
involves invoking LT(), getText() - which means creating the string out
of the input stream, then a string comparison, which is another method
call in itself. I can't see how that will cost less than looking for a
token value as it invokes three method calls. Java doesn't seem to do a
great job of optimizing conditionals, but it should be able to do better
than two method calls, constructing a string via substring and a string
comparison I should think? I would also think that the DFA is faster
than that construct. 

My preference is based upon the observed performance of C I admit, where
the keywords rule is a much better performer (though I might go recheck
that to make sure ;-). Maybe the opposite is indeed true for Java.

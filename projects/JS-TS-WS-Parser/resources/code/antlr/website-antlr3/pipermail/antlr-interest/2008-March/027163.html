<PRE>Hmmm...a tool that automatically produces an &quot;AST&quot; just from an input 
grammar.
What a novel concept!  ;)

But the authors call it an &quot;AST&quot; when in fact it's really just a parse 
tree, not an AST.
Strange that the authors themselves would make such a mistake - to think 
that a parse
tree might make a reasonable default AST...what a silly mistake.

Don't they realize that building an AST is hard, and no one should be 
able to
get an AST &quot;for free&quot;? Don't they realize that's not an AST at all, but 
a parse tree, and that
the *real* AST that this input grammar has asked for is a useful, 
simple, flat, data structure?

Clearly they just don't know what they're talking about  and so should 
be ignored.

Andy ;)

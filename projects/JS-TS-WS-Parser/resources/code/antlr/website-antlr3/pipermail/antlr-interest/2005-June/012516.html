<PRE>

Maybe its me, but I cannot find anything about the new relese on
www.antlr.org, nor can I find anythign about the licensing policy of
this new release? Why is this so??

I am currently using 2.7.5, but find it hard to track what is going on
in the ANTLR community.

Yes, we have this news group, but a news group is a very inefficient
when it comes to finding information you (I, we) need in a hurry:
Searching for a keyword more often than not gives matched to another
person who asks the same question or someone who thinks they know the
answer.

Speaking in general terms, most of the ANTLR site seems to be for the
&quot;inner circle&quot; only: It is very hard to find information about ANTLR.
The getting started examples are too basic to do any real stuff, and the
provided examples are also either to simple, or way over a beginners
head. 

I am over the beginner level know (I think and hope), but getting there
was very time-consuming: And, isn't a tool like this about saving time?

I have learned the tool the hard way, but is the way &quot;we&quot; want this to
be?


By the way: ANTLR IS great, but I wish it could be more &quot;approachable&quot;

Howdy!

I can't believe it!  Finally, I have something that people can look  
at for ANTLR v3:

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-3.0ea1.tar.gz">http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-3.0ea1.tar.gz</A>
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/download/examples-v3.tar.gz">http://www.antlr.org/download/examples-v3.tar.gz</A>

and Jean Bovet has created a 1.0ea1 release of his excellent ANTLRWorks:

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/works/index.html">http://www.antlr.org/works/index.html</A>

The ANTLRWorks jar has everything you need including ANTLR 3.0ea1.

Per the license in LICENSE.txt, this software is not guaranteed to  
work and might even destroy all life on this planet.

ANTLR and ANTLRWorks are released under the BSD license, though  
ANTLRWorks has no source with it at the moment.

Feel free to send comments to the antlr-interest list or if you want  
to send patches:

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/misc/feedback">http://www.antlr.org/misc/feedback</A>

(minor tweak to the contribution license coming tomorrow AM; had even  
more lawyers look at it &lt;snicker&gt;)

Expect this software to change over the summer (syntax+libraries  
possibly) with hopefully a number of early access releases.  Expect  
more language targets.  Ric Klaren is working on the C templates and  
the C# folks are reportedly working on the C# templates (should be  
easy given it's similarity to Java).

The only thing I can tell you is that it seems to work for the  
examples-v3.tar.gz examples.

Just so you know, you will be asked to &quot;register&quot; when you first  
bring up ANTLRWorks.

PS    Looks like Europe and Asia get it first, given the timing. :)

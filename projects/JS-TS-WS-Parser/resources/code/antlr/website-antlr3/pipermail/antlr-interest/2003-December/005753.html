It is indeed very desirable that the list be spam-free. On the other
hand, since no individual or company I know can claim to be fully
spam-free, I don't see how the standards should be any different for
this list. Plus, any mesures taken to counter spam by
individuals/companies would also automatically work on mail received
from this list.

&gt;<i> Moreover, if the spam is X-rated, it can cause

The spam (as I receive them) are text messages with a URL. What the
URL links to is irrelevant as both it and the message that contains it
are so obviously not ANTLR business.

&gt;<i> I would certainly be very

This is an extreme position to be sure but, you are entitled to your
own opinion.

My own opinion is that if the spam-to-noise ratio increases, we should
try moderation (using long-time active members). If the moderation
loop seriously impacts on the send-receive roundtrip time, we should
stop it and advise members to install spam filters locally (which most
everyone already have anyways).

Cheers,

Micheal

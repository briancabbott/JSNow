<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> We're still talking DFA's right? Depending on whether the DFA is  
</I>&gt;<i> state-centric or transition-centric, you would put the Command  
</I>&gt;<i> stucturally in a State or Transition... Just thinking out loud here.
</I>
Well yes, but we're talking about saving arbitrary user data, or not?

&gt;<i> I think the size of the serialization 'file' should be configurable  
</I>&gt;<i> on startup. A circular log would prevent runaway log size. If the  
</I>&gt;<i> user had a really large walk from node to node before a confirmed  
</I>&gt;<i> match, they would have to make sure the log file size was  
</I>&gt;<i> configured large enough.
</I>
Sorry, but that sounds a lot like implementing a database, but at all  
like implementing a parser generator, at least to me. And you didn't  
even start about all the concurrency issues with the log ;-)

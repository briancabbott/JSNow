<PRE>Brian,

My reason for XML is so the parser can be used as an
independent multi-language, multi-platform component.
The parser is in C#, and yet there are interfaces from
C++, C, and even Java that would use the component.
They simply send the SQL to be parsed in some form of
a string prsentation, and in turn they will receive a
string that is a description of the parsed tree.
&quot;string&quot; object is the only common thing all languages
and platforms have in common, and XML seems to be the
perfect solution for this ( but of course I maybe
overlooking something - which most likely can very
well be the case)!

Having said that, for now I really dont care much
about making this parser so generalized to be useable
from different languages and platforms. So I am
looking for the best, easiest and &quot;QUICKEST&quot; way of
developing the means to traverse through the parsed
tree and extract the meta data (something that using
XML DOM would otherwise provide)...

&gt;<i> Well, maybe you could try to use the built-in AST 
</I>&gt;<i> serialization-to-XML mechanism 
</I>
Can you elaborate on this? This sounds interesting but
not sure if it means what it implies. So I will be
thankful if you can explain this a bit more as what
this would mean and how I can do it?

&gt;<i> consider
</I>&gt;<i> creating an ANTLR 
</I>&gt;<i> TreeParser to extra the metadata. An ANTLR
</I>&gt;<i> TreeParser should be simpler 
</I>&gt;<i> and easier to maintain
</I>
Again if I can have more info on this and what this
means and would involve I will be most thankful.. Have
not looked at the documentation on ANTLR, but I assume
this is explained in detail ?? 

Your thoughts on this are greatly appreciated.

Regards,

- Addi

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just wanted to say that I have truly come to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appreciate Antlr. This is really a great tool.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I just used the Antlr SQL grammar that is provided
</I>&gt;<i> by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mr. Brent Wiese, and also using the C# parser
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; generator by Michael J., and it works great!
</I>&gt;<i> Needed to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do some manual fixing of the generated Csharp
</I>&gt;<i> code,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but it was minor.. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So THANK you Michael J., and Brent Wiese.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now the only thing that is left is to come up with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some sort of a XML schema and have the parser
</I>&gt;<i> generate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; its parsed tree based on that schema.. Any input
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and/or help is greatly appreciated. I have zipped
</I>&gt;<i> up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the SQL CSharp parser (it is about 280KB) and I
</I>&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be more than happy to send it to anyone who is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interested in contributing...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The ironic thing about ANTLR is that not too many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people know about it -- or perhaps it is only the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ignorants who do not know about it and come to

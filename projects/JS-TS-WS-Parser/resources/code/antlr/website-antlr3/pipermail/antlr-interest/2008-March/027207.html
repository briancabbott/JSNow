<PRE>Thanks, Pete.

Yes, I can certainly now see how your translator is &quot;non-trivial&quot; and 
doesn't need an AST.

Looks like maybe the situation is similar to IDL for CORBA, where the 
input language is
nicely defined as a subset of several other languages and then used to 
generate those
other languages.

So rather than &quot;trivial&quot; or not, the issue is whether or not the &quot;from&quot; 
language was really designed
so that it could be translated to the &quot;to&quot; language.

Thanks again for posting this...I wasn't picturing this sort of case at 
all. An AST might help,
but it might not.

Good luck with it, and I hope I didn't offend you or anything. Just 
picture me working
to replace C pointers with Java and C++ templates with Java generics all 
day and you
can imagine where my incredulous attitude comes from :)

Andy

</I>&gt;<i> That poster was me.  To give Andy some details, my translator reads

</I>&gt;<i> ~1250 Java files.  MOF is Managed Object Format, a language used to

</I>&gt;<i> standard for representing computers and networks.  The Common

</I>&gt;<i>  The MOF files are available at 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.dmtf.org/standards/cim/cim_schema_v2171/.">http://www.dmtf.org/standards/cim/cim_schema_v2171/.</A>  The DMTF wanted 
</I>&gt;<i> to define an object-oriented model while staying language-agnostic, so 
</I>&gt;<i> they use MOF.  MOF isn't wildly different than Java, hence my 
</I>&gt;<i> translator qualifies as &quot;trivial&quot; as Loring defined trivial: 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Trivial translations--A source to B source for languages in which 
</I>&gt;<i> language B can straightforwardly express the paradigms of language 
</I>&gt;<i> A--can be done without intermediate analysis.  Even there, an AST is 
</I>&gt;<i> helpful and aids maintainability.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps the negative connotation of the word &quot;trivial&quot; has made this 
</I>&gt;<i> into more of an argument than it's worth.  At first I assumed that 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;trivial&quot; meant &quot;small&quot; or &quot;for teaching purposes&quot; or something. My 
</I>&gt;<i> translator seems nontrivial to me.  The grammar has ~900 lines, yet no 
</I>&gt;<i> AST.  I built it by reading the ANTLR book, learning as I went, and 
</I>&gt;<i> didn't encounter a need for an AST.  Others might have a similar 
</I>&gt;<i> experience, so I posted to learn why ASTs should be used.  As a result 
</I>&gt;<i> of this thread, I now think an AST might improve my translator 
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat.  I plan to add one to get separation-of-concerns and to 
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps discover the &quot;helpful and aids maintainability&quot; benefits that 
</I>&gt;<i> Loring mentioned.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So Andy, I hope you aren't still bugged by this, but I remain 
</I>&gt;<i> unconvinced that every useful (nontrivial) translation needs an AST.

<PRE>Sorry, I don't get you ...

If it's a &quot;supported action language&quot;, then surely the Antlr runtime
must be available?

If I get Antlr to emit a lexer/parser in C++, I want to be able to
compile that into an executable, otherwise what's the point of doing it?
And if the runtime is only available as Java, then my lexer/parser isn't
going to work, so what was the point of doing it?

But for any COMPILEABLE language, your requirement can be met by gcj :-)

For any INTERPRETED &quot;supported action language&quot;, well it can't be a
supported action language unless either the language supports calls into
Java or the Antlr runtime has been ported into it ... and the former
could easily not be an available option.

Cheers,
Wol

So you're wanting someone to reimplement the Antlr run-time for every
single, supported action language?  Ouch.

Take care,

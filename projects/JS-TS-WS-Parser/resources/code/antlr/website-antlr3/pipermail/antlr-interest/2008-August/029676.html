<PRE>Yes, but that has performance problems since a collection range tests look like
   if (foo &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; foo &lt; 10 )
       &lt;do something&gt;
   else if (foo == 13)
       &lt;do something else&gt;
   else ...

and that can get very slow when you have to do all of the tests to find out that a character is not in the set.  It is possible to use a 64KB array to map characters into bytes (there is text where there are more than 256 useful characters, but that requires a mix of languages), but that layer of indirection is also undesirable.

I suspect that there is a clever solution, but I haven't thought of one.

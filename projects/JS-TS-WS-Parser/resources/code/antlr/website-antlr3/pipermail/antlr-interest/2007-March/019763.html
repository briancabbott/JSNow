 &gt;Hi. I believe a PEG would do
 &gt;a b &amp;c &amp;d
 &gt;using &amp; predicates that match but don't consume.

Actually thinking on it a bit more, I wonder if using a &quot;!!&quot; 
suffix might be more appropriate (as in &quot;a b c!! d!!&quot;).  That way, 
one ! means &quot;match, consume, but don't output&quot;, and two !s means 
&quot;match, don't consume, and don't output&quot;.

(I still think ! should work in the lexer, though, even if only as 
a prefix/suffix for performance reasons.  That's the most common 
case anyway.)

 &gt;Auto backtracking will do the optimal &quot;use synpred only if 
LL(*)
 &gt;fails&quot;, but (...)=&gt; manual predicates will force backtracking to 

 &gt;eval the pred.  I can't know what's inside compared to alt
 &gt;whereas with auto backtracking pred is copy of alt.

Oh, right, you have to avoid executing actions while in a path 
that can potentially backtrack, so they need to be gone through 
twice.  Forgot about that.

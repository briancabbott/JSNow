First of all, make sure you hit the &quot;Reply to All&quot; button so that 
your reply goes to the list as well.  You're more likely to get a 
response that way.

&gt;<i>BTW, I am using C# generated code - could this be an issue?
</I>
No, this is a grammar problem, not a target problem.

&gt;<i>name_blank_name
</I>&gt;:<i> NAME ( BLANK NAME )*
</I>&gt;<i>;
</I>
That won't work, because BLANK tokens will still be getting 
skipped (or if they're not, then it'll mess up other bits of your 
grammar).  As I said, if you want to skip whitespace most of the 
time but treat it as significant sometimes, then you have to do it 
in the lexer.


&gt;<i>I also tried changing the lexer rule, but got a compile error:
</I>
What was the error?

&gt;<i>NAME_BLANK_NAME
</I>&gt;:<i> NAME ( BLANK NAME )*
</I>&gt;<i>;
</I>
It's not quite as easy as that; since NAME can contain an 
arbitrary number of characters, there's ambiguity between NAME and 
NAME_BLANK_NAME.  You'd have to write a hybrid type-changing rule 
if you wanted to do it this way.

But as I said in my original message, if you're trying to 
represent a string value then this is completely the wrong 
approach, since it will collapse whitespace.  ie. it would have no 
way of representing &quot;hello  world&quot; (two spaces) -- it would always 
translate it into &quot;hello world&quot; (one space).  Plus, the above 
doesn't take leading or trailing space into account.

You need to make the lexer match an entire string (including the 
quotes) as a whole.  That way you can preserve the exact contents 
of the string.

&gt;<i>Is there an example grammer you can point to, I haven't found one 
</I>&gt;<i>yet...
</I>
Have a look at examples/csharp/tinyc/lexer.g, specifically at the 
CHAR_LITERAL and STRING_LITERAL rules.  You basically want a 
hybrid of the two, though you can probably simplify the escape 
handling (only supporting escaping backslashes and single quotes; 
though that depends on your particular dialect).

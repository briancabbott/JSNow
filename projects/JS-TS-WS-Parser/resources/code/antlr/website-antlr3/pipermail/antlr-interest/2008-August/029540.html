<PRE>Hi!

&quot;Gavin Lambert&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">antlr at mirality.co.nz</A>&gt; wrote (Sun Aug  3 14:01:32 2008):
&gt;<i> The trouble with doing this kind of thing in the parser is that you  
</I>&gt;<i> no longer have single tokens.  In addition to giving extra work for  
</I>&gt;<i> the tree walker to deal with
</I>
I can't see extra work. I rather might save some work, for if lexer  
would give me a RANGE token with text &quot;5..10&quot;, to create a proper AST,  
I'd have to split this string. My way, I have the components directly  
at hand. But where is an imagined tree walker affected  by how we  
create the AST?

&gt;<i> this also means that any HIDDEN or off-channel tokens produced by  
</I>&gt;<i> the lexer could have been silently inserted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This isn't always a bad thing -- after all, it will let you parse  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;1./*foo*/5&quot; as if it were &quot;1.5&quot; -- but that might turn out to be  
</I>&gt;<i> more confusing than helpful.  And it would similarly parse &quot;1.    5&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> as &quot;1.5&quot; as well, which is usually less desirable.  (Assuming that  
</I>&gt;<i> comments and whitespace are being hidden.)
</I>
This is, of course, true. We don't want another spacecraft explode in midair.
One could get around this not ignoring whitespaces et al. But that, I  
suppose, would lead to far more trouble.


I wonder, anyway, why neither

|<i> (a=INT)? ONE_DOT b=INT  -&gt; ^(FLOAT {new CommonToken(FLOAT, $a.text +  
</I>&quot;.&quot; + $b.text)})

nor

|<i> (a=INT)? ONE_DOT b=INT  -&gt; {new CommonTree(new CommonToken(FLOAT,  
</I>$a.text + &quot;.&quot; + $b.text))}

would work as page 170 of ANTLR reference proposes.


Regards

Raphael

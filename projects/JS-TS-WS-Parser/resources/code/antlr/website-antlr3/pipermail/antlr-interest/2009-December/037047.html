&gt;<i> -----Original Message-----
</I>&gt;<i> From: <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">antlr-interest-bounces at antlr.org</A> [mailto:antlr-interest-
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, now I just have to tell a little story of how semicolons can
</I>&gt;<i> cause a lot of pain, it happened to me recently. It begins with the
</I>&gt;<i> horror that is T-SQL, which is one of my day-job languages. The other
</I>&gt;<i> day I started working with Service Broker, a queue technology built
</I>&gt;<i> into SQL Server. It's great stuff, but patching it into T-SQL
</I>&gt;<i> apparently wasn't entirely painless. To send messages to the queue you
</I>&gt;<i> use SEND, e.g.:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> SEND ON CONVERSATION ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I had written a simple procedure to send a message, and I wanted
</I>&gt;<i> to try it. But it didn't compile, complaining about some error at a
</I>&gt;<i> line that completely didn't make sense.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I spent god knows how much time on this, and then accidentally bumped
</I>&gt;<i> into a blog post where I noticed something strange. The writer always
</I>&gt;<i> used a semicolons before his SEND statements, as in &quot;;SEND ON
</I>&gt;<i> CONVERSATION&quot;. And then I noticed a comment saying that the ; was
</I>&gt;<i> there because of some issues with the T-SQL parser. I guess that in
</I>&gt;<i> T-SQL semicolons are usually optional, but in the case of SEND,
</I>&gt;<i> whatever comes before it must apparently end with a semicolon.
</I>&gt;<i> Wonderful.
</I>
Your T-SQL issue comes from language 'non-design' ;-) and the fact it is a hand crafted parser trying to deal with ambiguity. You could try my parser at: www.temporal-wave.com and let me know if I can parse that (if you want to give me an example if I cannot, I would be grateful). Basically this isn't an example of SEMI causing problems, but the fact that as T-SQL does not enforce it, it must break its own rules and enforce it 'sometimes'!! If the SEMI was universally required, then parsing SQL/T-SQL would be much easier and as a consequence, the error messages received would be much more accurate. In other words, this example completely reinforces my point ;-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I care about syntax, otherwise I would have chosen
</I>
Od course.

&gt;<i> S-Expressions as the &quot;syntax&quot; for my language, and therefore I don't
</I>&gt;<i> want to pollute the syntax with unnecessary parens and commas and
</I>&gt;<i> semi-colons. 
</I>
Unnecessary ones, of course, but for your problem, the parens are necessary. 

&gt;<i> It may not be a big deal in practice, I guess it's one of
</I>&gt;<i> those areas where programmers have very different views, but it's
</I>&gt;<i> certainly useful in learning Antlr because it seems to give me a few
</I>&gt;<i> extra challenges that require digging a little deeper.
</I>
Yes - it will also allow you to understand where such things are not really superfluous after all. Even humans cannot scan without backtracking if there is no punctuation at all.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But back to my problem. With a little guidance from you and John it
</I>&gt;<i> looks like I've nailed it. 
</I>
Cool.

I just had to get over the idea of having
&gt;<i> completely arbitrary expressions as arguments, and instead only
</I>&gt;<i> allowing atom expressions like literals or IDs as arguments, anything
</I>&gt;<i> else must be wrapped in parens. 
</I>
That will work, but beware that you are reducing your ability to show errors semantically rather than syntactically. Then you get errors like your SQL one where it says &quot;SEND unexpected here&quot;, which gives you no clue, but &quot;Arguments for functions cannot be complicated...&quot; does.

&gt;<i> Makes more sense in practice anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, as you noticed I didn't quite understand the precedence, leading
</I>&gt;<i> me to pull the function application all the way up to the root
</I>&gt;<i> expression, I've now moved it down so it has the highest precedence.
</I>
That is the usual mistake. Only takes learning once though.

&gt;<i> The final grammar is included below. The only thing I'm not perfectly
</I>&gt;<i> happy with is the semantic predicate in the funcAppl rule. It is
</I>&gt;<i> necessary to stop Antlr from emitting a warning, but it does seem like
</I>&gt;<i> Antlr does exactly what I want without the predicate. 
</I>
You can ignore the warning if it does what you want. In the next release we will have warning suppression based on a cool idea from Ter.

&gt;<i> I understand the
</I>&gt;<i> warning, as Antlr can match both the ID at the start of funcAppl and
</I>&gt;<i> at the start of atomExpr. But since it all works just fine without the
</I>&gt;<i> predicate it's tempting to lose it and and presumably save some
</I>&gt;<i> resources, but I'd like to know for sure.
</I>
Left factor the ID's, then you only need a single token predicate as per the grammar I sent you in the earlier reply. Avoid entire rules in syntactic predicates wherever you can.

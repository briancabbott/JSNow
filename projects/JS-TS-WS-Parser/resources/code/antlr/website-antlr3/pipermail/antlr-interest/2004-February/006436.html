I'm still planning on rewriting it. Mainly to support Unicode and make it
more C++ style.

Actually only the default CharBuffer relies on std::istream. The lexer
only uses InputBuffer mechanics to access it's input.

Erm why not write a custom InputBuffer for your caching stream (or for your
particular stream wrapper baseclass)? Have a look at the CharInputBuffer
for a simple example.

There are still many unknowns for the C++ support lib rewrite. I still have
to research unicode more. I would prefer not to make antlr depend on a
third party library (like IBM's unicode lib) but this may be unavoidable to
get good unicode support. I suspect there will be some template use to plug
different string backends into the lib (so people can easily have a 'lite'
version or a heavier 'unicode' version, I also see room for performance
improvements here with tweaks to the codegen and template parameters) 
Adding stream wrappers in this mix might be possible but it could well be
that they will complicate things.

It seems that the choice within your company to move out of the way of
streams is mostly due to cross vendor STL/compiler support. While I can
understand this decision I'm not sure wether its a good idea for antlr.
Eventually compilers and standard library will improve up to a point that
the issues you mentioned will dissapear. I'd rather engineer towards the
standard than towards making an own standard.

So in short I'd have to give a logical maybe as answer, adding/using
wrappers per default I'd rather not do. Making it easier to plug such
wrappers into antlr is not a problem (as long as they're sane and it does
not complicate things).

Cheers,

Ric

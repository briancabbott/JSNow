&gt;<i> I was wondering if anybody had ever tried to use ANTLR to implement a

</I>
I've gotten a great start on this yesterday and today. In particular, I was able to replace the 
rule-based partition scanner with one driven by an ANTLR-generated lexer. It's still going 
to need some work to be more robust in the face of lexing errors (e.g. illegal characters in 
the input), but I'm working on it. :)

&gt;<i> It seems like all that would be required would be to interface the lexer
</I>&gt;<i> to the Eclipse representation of a document (so you could scan the
</I>&gt;<i> characters in the document) ...
</I>
Done. I had to create my own plug-compatible replacement for the InputBuffer class (as 
indicated by yesterday's post re: in-memory I/O.) I also created a &quot;lexer token&quot; wrapper to 
bridge between ANTLR's tokens and Eclipse's IToken. 

&gt;<i> ... and then somehow tuck the results away so
</I>&gt;<i> that subsequent calls to specialized token scanners, etc. wouldn't even
</I>&gt;<i> look at the document but would instead just return information based on
</I>&gt;<i> walking the AST.
</I>
A syntax-based editor would need both the low-level lexer tokens *and* the AST as the 
AST is (by definition) distilled and re-organized from the tokens. The AST could drive the 
Outline panel, provide syntax checking and refactoring support, etc.

Once I have the lexer-partitioning interface working robustly, even with bad input, I can 
move on and start experimenting binding in the AST. Still, it's pretty cool to have 
automatic code coloration running off an ANTLR lexer with only about 8 hours of work.

<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i>  It's far too easy to make mistakes when writing rules;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grammars are not easy!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's true. And it's made even harder by tools that claim the problem
</I>&gt;<i> is they couldn't choose between A and B, where B would produce a
</I>&gt;<i> broken result that is completely illegal (not a matter of taste or
</I>&gt;<i> choice, but a complete failure to recognize the specified language)
</I>
I think &quot;specified language&quot; is the key here. What I specify and what
I mean are often two different things, especially in early
development. The more a tool can help me with &quot;did you really mean
that&quot;, the better.

I've gotta say you have an interesting argument here, but I always get
afeared of the &quot;slippery slope&quot; and &quot;trickle-down&quot; effects. After
this, what would be the next &quot;only reasonable way&quot; that we move into
the tool? It makes the tool less general-purpose, and could end up
having some unintended consequences.

Of course there is another option: you can create your own parser
generator that does this. If this feature and others prove more
helpful and easier to understand, natural selection should take its
course...

I prefer to have tools be a wee-bit less clever so I don't need to
understand their cleverness to use them, though it's a fine line to
find...

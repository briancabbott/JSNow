Ter,
Interesting notes!
Do you have a list of the systems that were represented?
I'm guessing TXL and DMS (from Semantic Designes) where there,
but I'm curious as to what the others were.

I had looked at a few of these when I was first starting on my
C-to-Java translator (www.jazillian.com). I had the same impression
that you had about &quot;big, closed systems&quot; vs. &quot;small tools to 
be incorporated into a larger program&quot;. I wasn't convinced that
any of these could do something as simple as convert a printf()
call to a System.out.println() call. Seems to me that
&quot;hand-coding&quot; would will be required all over the place, and
trying to integrate, say, TXL with my own Java code looked
like a nightmare. So after several months work, I gave up on
AST-to-AST translation and came up with my own system
(described briefly here: <A HREF="http://jazillian.com/design.html">http://jazillian.com/design.html</A>)

I'm also curious...if you got a flavor for what each of these
things do, which one would you guess would be the best
platform for building, say, a C to Java translator?

<PRE>I thought I had things working based on the fix below. I ran Antlr, and compiled a project based on its output without error. However, when I try to run the project, I get:

An unhandled exception of type 'System.IO.FileLoadException' occurred in Tree1.exe

Additional information: Could not load file or assembly 'Antlr3.Runtime, Version=3.3.0.7239, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=eb42632606e9261f' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)

Do I need to somehow rebuild/update the DLL so I can run it? Is it a .NET security thing that refuses to use the modified .stg files? And somehow when Antlr3.exe runs, it get around this?

Hi Andy!

This is a know bug. Read
<A HREF="http://antlr.1301665.n2.nabble.com/Problems-with-Tree-Grammars-outputting-Templates-in-C-td6724828.html">http://antlr.1301665.n2.nabble.com/Problems-with-Tree-Grammars-outputting-Templates-in-C-td6724828.html</A>
to find the solution.

Cheers,
Maik

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying to collect all the StringTemplates created by all instances of one rule (borg) into a StringTemplate for a containing rule (prog). But I can't seem to find the right syntax:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> options {
</I>&gt;<i>        output = template;
</I>&gt;<i>        language = CSharp3;
</I>&gt;<i>      tokenVocab=Tree1;
</I>&gt;<i>        ASTLabelType = CommonTree;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> public prog
</I>&gt;<i> : (b+=borg)+ -&gt; template(vals = {$b})
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;&lt;
</I>&gt;<i> { // prog
</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;vals; separator = &quot;,&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The syntax I tried above is one many approaches I've tried - none seem to work. Antlr3 runs without error but the code won't compile. I hope the intent is clear, as it is a pretty simple example. I've looked back and forth in Terence's book trying to find something like this, and in the examples, but so far I've struck out. It seems like a very common thing to try to do!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One strange thing is that when I look at the generated code, the list for b (list_b) is declared as List&lt;CommonTree&gt;. But Terence's books says is should be List&lt;StringTemplate&gt; when the output type is template. Later in the generated code, when it tries to add to the list, it tries to create a List&lt;StringTemplate&gt;, which seems right, but causes a compiler error. It almost seems like a bug, but I probably just don't understand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can anyone help me with this?
</I>&gt;<i>

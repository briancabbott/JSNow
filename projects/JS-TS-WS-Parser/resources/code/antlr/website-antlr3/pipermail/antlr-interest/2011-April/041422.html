<PRE>I mentioned this idea in a prior message, calling it a &quot;zero-width 
negative look-ahead assertion&quot;, mainly because I am unfamiliar with the 
term &quot;syntactic predicate&quot;. I didn't say much about implementation, though.

Two suggestions for this would be to allow ANTLR to:

1) treat:

kreturn : 'return' ws? ;

as if it were:

kreturn : 'r' 'e' 't' 'u' 'r' 'n' ws? ;

2) permit the use of regular expressions instead of simple strings in 
such instances which would then make that production look like:

kreturn : 'return\s?' ;

and with the addition of dealing with the keyword problem:

kreturn : 'return(?!\W)' ;

where (?!\W) looks at but does not consume the next character on the 
stream and the test passes only if the character is a non-word ( \W 
matches anything that is not a-z, A-Z, 0-9 or _ ).

I apologize for my ignorance of ANTLR architecture. I have no idea if or 
how the architecture of ANTLR would support this.

On a related note, it looks to me that when you have something like:

kreturn : 'return' ws?;

that the lexer is automatically created with a lexical element 'return' 
whereas my initial expectation is that 'return' would only be tested for 
existence at that particular point in the parsing process. I think 
limiting the parser to only considering the rule at hand is crucial to 
obtaining the flexibility implied by a scanner-less parser generator.

Best regards,
Jason Doege

</I>&gt;<i> The sample at <A HREF="http://bit.ly/gT3Q1C">http://bit.ly/gT3Q1C</A> cannot distinguish between &quot;returnme;&quot; and &quot;return me;&quot;, because kreturn is expressed as:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> kreturn : 'r' 'e' 't' 'u' 'r' 'n' ws? ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My first thought was, just make the whitespace not optional. But, in C for example, we can have
</I>&gt;<i> return;
</I>&gt;<i> return me;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> whereas &quot;returnme;&quot; would be a syntax error. Now, making ws not optional is no longer possible; what is really needed is a way to express
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;'r' 'e' 't' 'u' 'r' 'n' followed by anything that can NOT be part of an identifier&quot;. Although you could re-write the return statement rule to something awful like
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> retstat: kreturn ws? colon
</I>&gt;<i>           | kreturn ws id colon
</I>&gt;<i>           ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the underlying problem remains: there is no way to prevent ANTLR entering rule kreturn upon seeing an identifier like &quot;returnme&quot; that happens to start with the same letters as keyword &quot;return&quot;. In Rats!, you would write
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> KRETURN = &quot;return&quot; !LetterOrDigit ws? ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> where the &quot;!&quot; operator denotes a syntactic predicate meaning &quot;LetterOrDigit must not match, and corresponding input will not be consumed&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Without the ability to express &quot;something followed by anything that is not a letter or digit&quot;, I don't see how to get it right in ANTLR. I very much hope I am wrong though!

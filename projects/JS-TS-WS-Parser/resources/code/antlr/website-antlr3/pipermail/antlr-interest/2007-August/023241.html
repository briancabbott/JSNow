<PRE>I am back on this and have spent a day trying different things, looking
at the sample that you suggested, but no luck with recognizing the ' '
as part of the string. 

I made all changes in the lexer. 
I got rid of WS lexer rule. 

When I pass in an expression like this: 

	daver='some thing'

I get an error back:

expecting ''', found '&lt;EOF&gt;'

I attached my changed grammar. Please help!!

Thanks,

First of all, make sure you hit the &quot;Reply to All&quot; button so that your
reply goes to the list as well.  You're more likely to get a response
that way.

&gt;<i>BTW, I am using C# generated code - could this be an issue?
</I>
No, this is a grammar problem, not a target problem.

&gt;<i>name_blank_name
</I>&gt;:<i> NAME ( BLANK NAME )*
</I>&gt;<i>;
</I>
That won't work, because BLANK tokens will still be getting skipped (or
if they're not, then it'll mess up other bits of your grammar).  As I
said, if you want to skip whitespace most of the time but treat it as
significant sometimes, then you have to do it in the lexer.


&gt;<i>I also tried changing the lexer rule, but got a compile error:
</I>
What was the error?

&gt;<i>NAME_BLANK_NAME
</I>&gt;:<i> NAME ( BLANK NAME )*
</I>&gt;<i>;
</I>
It's not quite as easy as that; since NAME can contain an arbitrary
number of characters, there's ambiguity between NAME and
NAME_BLANK_NAME.  You'd have to write a hybrid type-changing rule if you
wanted to do it this way.

But as I said in my original message, if you're trying to represent a
string value then this is completely the wrong approach, since it will
collapse whitespace.  ie. it would have no way of representing &quot;hello
world&quot; (two spaces) -- it would always translate it into &quot;hello world&quot;
(one space).  Plus, the above doesn't take leading or trailing space
into account.

You need to make the lexer match an entire string (including the
quotes) as a whole.  That way you can preserve the exact contents of the
string.

&gt;<i>Is there an example grammer you can point to, I haven't found one 
</I>&gt;<i>yet...
</I>
Have a look at examples/csharp/tinyc/lexer.g, specifically at the
CHAR_LITERAL and STRING_LITERAL rules.  You basically want a hybrid of
the two, though you can probably simplify the escape handling (only
supporting escaping backslashes and single quotes; though that depends
on your particular dialect).

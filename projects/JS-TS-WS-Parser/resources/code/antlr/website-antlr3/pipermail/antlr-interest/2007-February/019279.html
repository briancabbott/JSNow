<PRE>Please could someone confirm that it is not possible to set separate
header sections in CPPParser and CPPLexer in Antlr 2.7 (or, if it is
possible, please let me know how, or where I can find out)?
 
The Antlr documentation doesn't say much about headers. It refers to
&quot;respective addendums&quot;. Please could someone let me know where they
are?
 
Basically what I want to do is to make information obtained by the
lexer from Line Directives in the preprocessed *.i file available to
the parser without involving an external file (thanks for your
suggestion Xue Yong Zhi (Digest vol 27 no 2, 2 Feb) but I was already
declaring them in another file (main.cpp)).
 
Thanks,
 
David Wigg

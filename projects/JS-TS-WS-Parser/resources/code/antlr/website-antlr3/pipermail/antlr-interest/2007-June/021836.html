Exactly in fact. Almost all recent activity in this group concerning ANTLR3 has been regarding the same 5 or 6 things (I exclude bugs in the C runtime to spare the author ;-). When all these 5 or 6 things are learned together then typing in the grammars that have been thrown about here is second nature (honestly) and you can produce it ANTLRWorks with little effort to rid yourself of ambiguity because you won't type it in that way. I suppose we ought to have some sort of crib sheet for this stuff, but everyone is busy of course and so we will get there via the book and wiki and so on. This is what I mean by learning the expectations first.

Now, creating a full recognizer for T-SQL or C++ is in fact still a big deal, so you don't want to choose that as your first project as here you are heading down the compiler write path expounded upon by Ter somewhat, depending on what you want to do with the recognizer of course.

Jim

PS: C++ Target work starts next week.
PPS: Unless anyone has any contract work they want me to do, as my current contract ends tomorrow :-)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note, you missed the fact that it has to be clear that those variables
</I>&gt;<i> are constants.  Obviously, if they are not, then you can't do the
</I>&gt;<i> substitution.

Right.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also as I was thinking about it, I don't like eliminating the
</I>&gt;<i> variables just because they are constants.  
</I>
Right. And thinking about it more, I think I lied, and I'd produce
System.out.println(&quot;hello&quot; + &quot; &quot; + &quot;world&quot;);
I do, however, attempt to do what real programmers would do.
Like I might see that a single println() call contains a bunch
of constants, all used only once, and so I should combine them.
I don't do that for C to Java, but I do for COBOL, where the nature of
how you declare variables make that a common occurance.

In COBOL, you very often see roughly:
01  MESSAGE
                05 HELLO PIC XXXXX VALUE &quot;HELLO&quot;
                05               PIC X VALUE SPACE
                05 WORLD PIC XXXXXX VALUE &quot;WORLD&quot;
...
WRITE MESSAGE

Here, not only are they constants, but in fact one of them (the space) 
doesn't
even have a name!

&gt;<i> Sometimes programmers do
</I>&gt;<i> things like that to make the code more readable, and crunching it into
</I>&gt;<i> one line again makes it less readable.  Without knowing the intent of
</I>&gt;<i> the programmer I would say it should not do such fancy things as
</I>&gt;<i> variable substitution.  Worse yet, if the string is overridden later,
</I>&gt;<i> or tested against, or things like that, then you've made the code
</I>&gt;<i> harder to maintain by putting the constant everywhere (perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> embedded in other strings).
</I>
Yea, this is the sort of thing I struggle with every day.

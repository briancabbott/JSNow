This would be a very good thing. I participate in a project at 
jakarta.apache.org and they have got read access for CVS for 
everyone. When you get read/write access you need SSH tools 
communicating with a SSH daemon on their side. Another example is 
sourceforge. Similar thing for read/write.

But this is *CVS*. Do not know how to do it with perforce. Is it 
accessible over the net in the first place? What about client 
licenses? Thought I heard it is free for open source development? 
Are there plugins available for the prominent IDEs?

Although I know the advantages of perforce over CVS and you would 
not want to switch back to CVS when you have seen perforce, would 
you consider making ANTLR visible to the outside with CVS? The 
drawback would be you would have to merge your changes in perforce 
with CVS and vice-versa. The advantage is everybody knows CVS and 
has the tools for it.

Not a perfect solution, but maybe worth thinking about it ;)

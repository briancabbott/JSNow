<PRE>Hi!

Your mail was addressed to Michael, but I hope it's ok to answer 
nonetheless:

I would consider hand-written code to walk an AST harmful. Maybe there 
are cases where it is useful, but walking a dynamically typed tree like 
this looks like a maintenance nightmare to me. Also, you make yourself 
highly dependent on the underlying tree-model, which changed a lot from 
antlr2 to antlr3.

I share some of your thoughts on tree-grammars: they are not solving 
every problem. But still, they are useful for computing easy properties 
like &quot;contains comparison&quot; or &quot;contains assignment to variable of type 
xxx&quot;. I guess what you are looking for is a tool to look for certain 
patterns in a source language, and how to map this pattern to another 
pattern of the same language? Possibly in concrete syntax, with 
placeholders? Yesterday I found a library called MatchO 
(<A HREF="http://wiki.di.uminho.pt/twiki/bin/view/Personal/Joost/MatchO">http://wiki.di.uminho.pt/twiki/bin/view/Personal/Joost/MatchO</A>) that 
seems to do just that, but I still have to experiment with it. With some 
modifications, it might even work for antlr3.

Best,
Andreas Meyer

</I>&gt;<i> I can see already you're no longer a neophyte - I would bet that what you're

</I>&gt;<i> A small guide to the code would be nice - just explaining how the code is structured

</I>&gt;<i> One issue that comes up occasionally is grammar inheritance.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, you have the exact same definition of expr_op in several of 
</I>&gt;<i> your .g files. So you might want to look into that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Proving an ant build.xml would be nice.
</I>&gt;<i> And, uhhh, what happened to Morph2.g and Morph3.g?  :)

<PRE>I want to upload the latest version of the C++ grammar file
(CPP_parser.g etc.) onto the ANTLR website.
 
I think this is usually done using a *.zip file.
 
However, I think this maybe a problem for some users who do not have
usable copies of Winzip so they would not be able to unzip the file. 
 
My first question is, can *.zip files be a problem for some users?
 
In any case it would seem better to upload a self-extracting zip file
(which I think the standard WinZip program (V.9?) can produce) so my
second question is, will uploading a self extracting file (eg.
CPP_parser_v_3.2.exe) be acceptable on the ANTLR website?
 
Thanks,
 
David

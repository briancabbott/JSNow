</I>For what you want to do, if you were familiar with grammars I would say 
it is easiest to type it in from scratch. However, as you are not, then 
why not take the example GNU C parser (download the examples from the 
download page), and take out the stuff you do not need (quite a lot of 
it). Advice: take out the keywords you don't want first, then remove the 
rules that use them, then remove other stuff you don't need.

The best thing to do then would be to use a string template to output 
your C file, then compile that to a .o file. The option output=AST; is 
what you need for that. However, you coudl also provide a few helper 
classes that build the .C file and just call into these with actions.

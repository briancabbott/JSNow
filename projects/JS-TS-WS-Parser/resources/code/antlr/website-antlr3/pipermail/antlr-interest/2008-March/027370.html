Each element within a tree parser is a tree node, which *contains* 
a token (and a collection of child nodes), but it's not a token 
itself.

There should be a way to get to the token itself, but I haven't 
really used tree grammars before myself so I can't tell you what 
it would be offhand.  If nobody else pipes up then your best bet 
would be to have a look at the generated code, particularly at the 
definition of the class it uses for the node.

(Although I do seem to recall also hearing that literal strings 
didn't work in tree grammars.  But that was a long long time ago 
so maybe that's been sorted out.)

<PRE>HI Scott,
I use Netbeans rather then Eclipse.  Haven't used local history, sounds similar, may only differ in the tree representation of undo's redo's.  I assume the local history has no concept of undo, it just saves each change so you cannot easly see you development deadends (backtracked branches)

I have not considered multiple files in particular  but as I mentioned the undo should save everything significant then when you backtrack to a previous state you are restored to exactly that state.  Because the main trunk is linear in time it can cope with working on multiple files add a method here .. call it there,  undo removes the call first and then removes the method later.

Also (unlike the existing Java UndoManager) if you backtrack  to some state and do some more changes, you do not loose any of the history and it is easy to go back to where you were (or anywhere else)

  Sounds kinda like the local history in eclipse.
  ......................

  However, you also need to be careful of timing with relation to refactoring operations that can affect multiple files, so consistency could be kept between files. But, the trick here is that other changes could be interspersed between refactorings. In other words, the changes between inter-related files could get in the way.

  ........................
  Also keep in mind that many commands tracked in an undo manager assume a specific program state. For example, typing text often assumes insertion of characters at a specific position, which is relative to previous commands (so commands usually cannot be undone/redone out of their original context).

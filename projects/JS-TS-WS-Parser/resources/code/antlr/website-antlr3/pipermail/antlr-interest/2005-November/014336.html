Thanks!  I tried the lexer from your Java grammar and this eliminated the 
exceptions.  The improvement is significant:  0.406 secs outside of 
debugger (i.e. 48% of original), 0.456 secs in the debugger (i.e. 0.8%!).  :-)

FYI I noticed that Todd King recently posted an updated C# grammar on the 
Antlr web site saying:

&quot;I designed this grammar for speed so I avoided using arbitrary lookaheads 
where I could. I got it down to just 7 lookaheads.&quot;

However, he is using the exact same lexer (from Robin Debreuil) with 
backtracking.  I didn't see an e-mail address, but someone should notify 
him about the technique used in your Java lexer.

I took a look at the 3.0 examples and this new design really does &quot;kick 
ass&quot; to quote a PowerPoint slide.  I think you are doing some genuinely 
innovative work, and I think your approach to the problem is right on.  I'm 
really looking forward to this release, and will give the &quot;early access&quot; 
build a try as soon as the C# codegen is in place.  Anyway, thanks for your 
help!

Cheers,
-Pete

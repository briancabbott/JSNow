This is possible with ANTLR, but it is also a huge project.  You may 
get a lot of mileage out of existing tools, such as Loring's suggestion 
Ephedra.  All research and time playing with existing tools will be 
time well spent.

Read my article &quot;Translation Project Planning&quot; 
<A HREF="http://www.codetransform.com/planning.html.">http://www.codetransform.com/planning.html.</A>  Also see my write-up about 
translating AREV to VB <A HREF="http://www.codetransform.com/fun_with_antlr.html">http://www.codetransform.com/fun_with_antlr.html</A> 
for more details on how that project went.

You may also be interested in &quot;The Realities of Language Conversions 
(2000)&quot; <A HREF="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/terekhov00realities.html">http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/terekhov00realities.html</A> to get a 
broader idea of what is and isn't possible with a translator.

Finally I would have to say that writing a translation project in ANTLR 
is a blast!  Hands down the most interesting programs I've ever 
written.

Writing a translator is so nice because you keep refining it and if you 
discover a better way to do a particular translation you implement it 
and voila, it's in all your translated code.  As opposed to discovering 
halfway through a manual translation and realizing you have 200K lines 
to scour and fix.

I recommend writing mountains of tests too, if you can figure a way to 
do it to test the old and new code.  Keeps your translator honest.

I do these things for a living.  Contact me if you decide to go the 
ANTLR route.

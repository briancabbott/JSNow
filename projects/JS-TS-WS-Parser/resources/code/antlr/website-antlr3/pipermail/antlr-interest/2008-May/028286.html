<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I was thinking of using it in the runtime. As I neither have 
</I>&gt;<i> used LINQ yet nor have looked for a place where LINQ would be 
</I>&gt;<i> useful I can't give you an example. It was simply on my list 
</I>&gt;<i> with a low priority - and you wanted to see all my items. ;) 
</I>&gt;<i> And to close this thread: I don't know if LINQ is useful in a 
</I>&gt;<i> lexer or parser within the generated part but users may use 
</I>&gt;<i> it in actions and member sections.
</I>
Sorry, I didn't mean to put you on the spot.

I had read an article using LINQ to implement parser combinators. His
version worked but was unoptimized iirc, I was hoping you had some ideas on
LINQ's utility...

Also saw this <A HREF="http://www.codeplex.com/LinqOverCSharp">http://www.codeplex.com/LinqOverCSharp</A> but, haven't had time
to even look at the code.

Supporting C# 3 syntax in actions would be cool!. I suspect that adding full
support for C# v3 syntax (incl. LINQ) in action blocks would require
target-language-specific action lexers as was the case with ANTLR v2.x - a
change to the ANTLR tool itself in other words.

<PRE>Ter,

It has been a couple of months since you wrote this.

Is this an accurate description of your &quot;GitHub pull accepting process&quot;?

If so, could you add it into a &quot;Developer's&quot; section of the ANTLR V3 
(and V4) FAQ, or, alternatively, as an explicit statement in the V3/V4 
READMEs (or both)?

I would like to be able to refer to your process in my reply to Mike 
Lischke on the subject of patches to the C runtime.  It seems we both 
have some patches which really should be incorporated into the official 
ANTLR v3 project.

Regards,

Stephen Gaito

&gt;<i> Hi Gang, thanks very much for all the helpful and insightful suggestions. I also talked it over in person with a few people yesterday. Sounds like the simplest thing to do is to create a single contributors file in the repository that contains the contributors license. Anyone that wants to be a contributor, can simply fork, add their name, commit, send a pull request and then they are in the system. Any future pull requests can be merged with a quick check on their name. The contributors file can also be augmented with their signoff him during the first pull request.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We've started fully qualifying everything in our normal commits, but the pull requests are still being merged with the syntax &quot;Merge pull request #23 from parrt/master&quot;, which will then propagate to and mess up the issues of everyone who merges antlr/antlr4 into their forks.
</I>&gt;<i> This I guess is only a problem if you are creating your own issues in your own fork of antlr, right? Can anyone comment on this problem?

ANTLRWorks really helps keeping the confusion to a minimum (or for  
that matter any kind of syntax highlighting is step in the right  
direction).
Once we have the ANTLR grammar ported to v3 I'll start working on an  
editor, too. ANTLRWorks is cool, I love it, but I really really do  
not like Java desktop apps, esp. on the Mac.

I think combined grammars are a really big improvement for  
readability and development speed. Having said that, I can imagine it  
to be helpful to have a different &quot;view&quot; onto a combined grammar,  
which could show you the lexer and parser parts separately. That  
might help to get a better view of what really happens behind the  
scenes :)

Just a thought,

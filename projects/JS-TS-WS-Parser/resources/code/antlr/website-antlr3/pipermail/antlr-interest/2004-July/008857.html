</I>&gt;<i>   I know that I'm in a minority here, but to me the power of ANTLR is

</I>&gt;<i>   automatic tree construction.
</I>
I can understand that for sure.  I usually do a mix since some stuff is 
easy and the AST suffix operators work great.

&gt;<i>   This said, my two cents is for an easy to use, easy to understand,
</I>&gt;<i>   robust parser generator that makes creating parsers for complex
</I>&gt;<i>   languages as easy as possible.  Rather than trees I'd rather have
</I>&gt;<i>   something that makes it easy to understand why the parser generator
</I>&gt;<i>   does not like my grammar.
</I>
Yes, i'm working hard on that in my head.  First step was to simply 
reduce the number of grammars that ANTLR couldn't handle; enter 
LL(star).  Unfortunately, when you do get an error it's harder to say 
how/why/where as the input could be arbitrarily long!  I'm thinking 
that I will build up a list of objects with all the info and then 
people can change the reporting behavior with a simple mechanism (just 
walk the list and do something else).  I suspect that an IDE will be 
really important here.  I would like to highlight the paths that are 
ambiguous etc...

&gt;<i>   From my point of view, trees are secondary.  Building trees is not
</I>&gt;<i>   that hard.  Writing parsers by hand is.  So the &quot;juice&quot; provided by
</I>&gt;<i>   ANTLR is that it helps with the most difficult part of parser
</I>&gt;<i>   construction.
</I>
The core engine will most definitely focus on this.  Anything else 
could perhaps be a &quot;plugin&quot; :)

&gt;<i>   Of course it's easy for me to say...  Terence, Loring and others are
</I>&gt;<i>   doing all the work.  Those who write the code get to call the
</I>&gt;<i>   shots.  And, as always, I deeply appreciate the work that has gone
</I>&gt;<i>   into ANTLR.
</I>
Thanks, as always, for your support, Ian. :)

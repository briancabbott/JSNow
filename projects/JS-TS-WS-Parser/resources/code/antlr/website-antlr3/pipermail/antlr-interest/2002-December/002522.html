<PRE>In particular the lexer is always at least k tokens ahead of the parser.  So
instead of telling the lexer &quot;I see a Y so switch lexers on the next token I
see,&quot; you are saying &quot;I see a Y so switch lexing on your next token which is
at least k but possibly many more tokens ahead of what I just matched.&quot;
There is a chance that the parser hasn't requested a new token from the
lexer yet, so buffering may give the illusion that the lexer is less than k
tokens ahead when it is told to switch.  But with syntactic predicates you
could conceptually lex the entire file before you actually commit to parsing
a particular alternative.  That's why the call it &quot;infinite lookahead.&quot;

It's unsafe to do from parser. In some situations you might get away with
it, but it's something that will break very easily. Think guns and feet
with holes in them.

<PRE>lol... (with you, not at you ;)

The way I've written ANTXR generally assumes that you'd be using an XSD or
DTD to do the actual &quot;validity checking&quot;, and that you're just using ANTXR
to give structure to your understanding of the XML. That's optional of
course, and you could really use the grammar to do that validation.

I don't think I'd recommend that though. My intent was to keep the ANTXR
grammar very simple, clean, and readable.

Later,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Scott, what would one gain from using ANTXR rather than a 
</I>&gt;<i> standard XML 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parser validating with an XSD/DTD.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   This directed at Scott, but I hope you'll forgive me if I throw in
</I>&gt;<i>   by two cents...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   There are reasons to use XSD - mainly that they're standard.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   However, the validation of a document against an XSD is, as far as I
</I>&gt;<i>   can tell, undefined.  The XSD does not actually define a grammer in
</I>&gt;<i>   any form that is formally defined.  For example, LL(1), LR(1),
</I>&gt;<i>   LALR(1) etc...  The validators seem to do recursive tree matching.
</I>&gt;<i>   Just because something validates does not mean it is correct.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   In contract, if you uses an real grammar with real validation (as
</I>&gt;<i>   ANTLR does), you would have a defined validation and reliability.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Seeing what has been done with XSDs, I have had to wonder if anyone
</I>&gt;<i>   who worked on this stuff ever took an undergrad compiler course.
</I>&gt;<i>

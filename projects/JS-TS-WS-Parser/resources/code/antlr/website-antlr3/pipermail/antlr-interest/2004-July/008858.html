I saw your article before writing this post, it didn't helped me.

You pursued a different goal:

[quote]
I was trying out some &quot;extreme programming&quot; while rewriting a parser
for AREV Basic, exploring incremental fixes to the problem of keywords
being used as identifiers. The first one I encountered was labels (as
in GOTO) with the name &quot;Exit&quot;, which is also a Basic statement. In
this case I reasoned that I could detect the &quot;GOTO&quot; and then safely
assume that what followed it was a really a label and not a keyword.
[/quote]

I mean, your problem is another special case. I don't know
maybe some ideas might be reused from your example, but it is not
clear to me.

Could we take calc.g from directory &quot;examples&quot; as a guinea 
pig and change it?

My real grammar and its furmulae are anyway 
more complicated then calc.g, but if we could do this 
for calc.g a lot of ppl could benefit from this show case
and use it as &quot;antlr design pattern&quot;.

thank you

<PRE>Hi Vladimir,

Ambiguity errors are often very puzzling, as we often see only what we (as
humans) wnat to see, rather than what is actually there.

I hope the following helps to get your grammar working...

- Bryan Ewbank

=== === ===
&gt;<i> grammer.txt:14:75: warning:nondeterminism between alts 1 and 2 of block upon
</I>&gt;<i> grammer.txt:14:75:     k==1:BEGIN
</I>
I think one of the problems is with interactions between &lt;program&gt; and
&lt;subprogramDeclarations&gt;.
    &lt;program&gt; says &quot;( subprogramDeclarations )?&quot;
    &lt;subprogramDeclarations&gt; says &quot;( ... )*&quot;
So, if there is no sequence of tokens that match subprogramDeclarations, what
does &lt;program&gt; do? It can either match one &lt;subprogramDeclarations&gt; (that
matches no tokens), or it can match no &lt;subprogramDeclarations&gt;.

If you replace &quot;(...)*&quot; with &quot;(...)+&quot; in &lt;subprogramDeclarations&gt;, you should
fix some of the warnings:

    subprogramDeclarations :
        (
            (procedureDeclaration | functionDeclaration)
            SEMI_COLON
        )+
    ;

=== === ===
&gt;<i> grammer.txt:40: warning:nondeterminism upon
</I>&gt;<i> grammer.txt:40:     k==1:SEMI_COLON
</I>&gt;<i> grammer.txt:40:     between alt 1 and exit branch of block
</I>
The error at line #40, from &lt;formalParameterList&gt;, is that when ANTLR sees a
SEMI_COLON it doesn't know if it's supposed to go &quot;around&quot; again, or quit.
Specifically, look at &lt;procedureDeclaration&gt; and you will see that
&lt;formalParameterList is followed immediately by SEMI_COLON.

I would guess that you really want to see parenthesis in the input stream, so
probably &lt;procedureDeclaration&gt; (and &lt;functionDeclaration&gt;) should be using
quoted parenthesis -- '(' and ')' -- around the &lt;formalParameterList&gt;

=== === ===
&gt;<i> grammer.txt:58:21: warning:nondeterminism between alts 1 and 2 of block upon
</I>&gt;<i> grammer.txt:58:21:     k==1:ID
</I>
The problem here is that both an assignmentStatement and a procedureStatement
start with an ID; if this is a correct language definition, you may require
k=2.  In procedureStatement, as in the procedureDeclaration, you need to quote
the parenthesis that you want as input tokens.

=== === ===
&gt;<i> grammer.txt:69:56: warning:nondeterminism between alts 1 and 2 of block upon
</I>&gt;<i> grammer.txt:69:56:     k==1:ELSE
</I>
This is a classic ambiguity - does ELSE match the most recent IF, or not:
    if (e1)
        if (e2)
            s1
    else
        s2
The easiest solution, to me, is to add the option greedy=true to the (...)?
around ELSE; see the manual for exact syntax.

=== === ===
&gt;<i> grammer.txt:105: warning:nondeterminism between alts 3 and 4 of block upon
</I>&gt;<i> grammer.txt:105:     k==1:ID
</I>
This is the same type of ambiguity as at line 51 - both &lt;variable&gt; and
&lt;functionReference&gt; start with an ID.
</PRE>

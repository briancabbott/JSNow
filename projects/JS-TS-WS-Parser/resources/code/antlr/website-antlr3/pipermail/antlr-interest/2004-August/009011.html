Yep, flexibility will remain key.  I think it is fruitless to try to 
make a grammar with extremely complicated actions like a full pascal-&gt;C 
translator language independent. At best, we can hope for a 
tree-building grammar possibly with symbol table management actions 
for, in this example, pascal.  Then have some templates/example 
pascal-AST tree walker grammars people can use for their specific 
application (such as C translation).  This puts the 
application-specific code out of the way of the most re-usable 
component, the parser/tree-builder pascal.g.  The tree walkers will 
mostly be application specific so there is no point worrying about 
making them language independent.

As a tactical issue, I wonder if having two kinds of actions is 
appropriate, one for a simple target independent action-language and 
one for language specific stuff.  Perhaps &lt;&lt;language specific&gt;&gt; and 
{antlr actions like newline}.  Just thinking out loud.

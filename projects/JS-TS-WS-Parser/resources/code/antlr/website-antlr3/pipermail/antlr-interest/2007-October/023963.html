<PRE>Hello, Ojay,

This isn't directly about your question, but I noticed that you have a 
lot of tokens in your lexer section like:

META_ATTRIBUTE
	:	'date' | 'datetime'
	;


and

PARAMETER 
	:	PARAMETER_DESC | CONST_DESC
	;


Please consider that Antlr actually encodes the convention of Lexer tokens starting with an upper-case letter, while Parser productions start in lower-case.
 
This means that you will have a lexer building regular expressions for &quot;PARAMETER_DESC&quot; and for &quot;PARAMETER&quot;. Obviously, one regex will be a superset of the other - either one could recognize the input.

For example, consider a regex like &quot;a+&quot; - match one or more 'a' letters. Then consider a regex like &quot;(a|b)+&quot; - match one or more of either a or b. Now it's obvious that aaaa will match &quot;a+&quot;, but it will also match (a|b)+. 

So which regex &quot;wins&quot; - that is, what does the lexer do? Simply, it goes with the one that is first (highest) in the file. 
 
The effect may surprise you, as you will be getting tokens that are too high-level: if a &quot;CONST&quot; could be a character literal ('a') or a hex number (0xf00)
how will you find out it's value? You'll have to take the token text, and RE-PARSE it to find out what it is.
 
You'll be better served if you convert most of your &quot;complex&quot; TOKENS into parser productions:

FORM_ATTRIBUTE
	:	'formId' |'formKey' | 'lastUpdate'
	;

In this case, let the 'formId' strings be the tokens -- the parser is smart enough to create automatic tokens like T01, T02, T03 for those three keywords. Then you would use a parser production like 'form_attribute' (or 'formAttribute' - it just has to start lower-case) to include the choice of any of the tree in your grammar, rather than your lexer.
 
form_attribute
	: 'formId' | 'formKey' | 'lastUpdate'
 	;

which is equivalent internally to:

T01: 'formId';
T02: 'formKey';
T03: 'lastUpdate';

form_attribute: T01 | T02 | T03 ;


The difference is in the parse/syntax trees you can generate. With the first approach, you will get:

term: FORM_ATTRIBUTE		# gives a parse like ^(term FORM_ATTRIBUTE{text=&quot;formKey&quot;})

term: form_attribute		# gives a parse like ^(term 'formId')

The difference is that with the FORM_ATTRIBUTE approach you don't actually know in the grammar what attribute you got - you'll have to write some code that checks $FORM_ATTRIBUTE.text to see which of the three strings it has in it. Whereas with the form_attribute version you can make decisions in the grammar based on knowing which keyword was used.



A good indicator is this:

PARAMETER_LIST 
	:	PARAMETER (' '+ PARAMETER)* ' '*

The fact that you have ' '+ and ' '* in there means you are having to fight against white space. That means you are trying to group several tokens into one super-token. Convert those things to parser productions by making them lower case, and the need to fight with white space will go away.

Try this:

arg_list:
	arg (',' arg)*
	;

commandType: 'IsSet' | 'IsEqual' | 'IsSmaller' | 'If' ;

command
	: commandType '(' arg_list? ')'
	;

You won't have to fight whitespace in there.
 
Alternatively, you might want to try:

arity1: arg ;
arity2: arg ',' arg ;
arity3: arg ',' arg ',' arg ;

command
	: 'IsSet'	'(' arity1 ')'
	| 'IsEqual'	'(' arity2 ')'
	| 'If'		'(' arity2 ')'
	| 'If'		'(' arity3 ')' 	// If-then-else version
	;

This approach spells out the expected number of arguments for each function. That makes the built-in functions a part of the syntax of the language, instead of being left to a later checking phase. The choice of where to put the check will depend on the language, but the example you have given points toward a &quot;basic-like&quot; language where functions are not definable by the user. If that is the case, then checking args in the parser may be a win. In a language like C or Java, where the user can add their own functions, you couldn't do that kind of checking. Then you would have to go with the first example (using an arg_list) and check the function args in your own code.

Good luck,

=Austin

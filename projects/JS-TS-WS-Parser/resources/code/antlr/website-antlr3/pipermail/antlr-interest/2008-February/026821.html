</I>Um. I guess I can. I didn't known you could stuff action inside the tree.

However in general that wouldn't be enough because I might want to use 
break, continue, arbitrary index manipulation, take a second pass 
through, put the loop in another loop or any number of odd things. being 
able to do &quot;foreach(Blob b in name_literal.Iterator)...&quot; would be of 
huge value.

I guess I can make that work. It does however lead to another question, 
how do I put in code that will run only if the tree matches [it wont run 
on say (NAME  name_literal   not_name_literal) ] but will run befor  the 
code attached to the name_literal? This is because I need that code to 
have side effects as part of setting stuff up for the other parts. It 
would be a bit more effort on my part but I might be able to dump the 
&quot;only on real match&quot; part. Either way the code would need to declare 
variable that are in scope later. (I could swear I've seen that last 
part but for the life of me I can't find where.)

Thanks

P.S. Where in the manual is your answerer covered? I'm thinking the same 
section ought to answer some of my other questions.

&gt;&gt;<i> I'm still stumped
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Looking at the generated code it looks like the parsed subtrees are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discarded (or if I refer to name_literal all but the last one is). Is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this the the planned behavior?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It seems that &quot;look for a list of foo's and then let me at them&quot; is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> common enough that there would be some special way to make it easy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Something like &quot;$name_literal.List&quot;. Is this not the case?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Am I approaching this wrong? I want to do stuff with the list of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> name_literals. Working with each name_literal by it's self is useless
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to me.

<PRE>Quoting Andrew Bell &lt;<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">andrew.bell.ia at gmail.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> But aren't you parsing input _text_.  Isn't what this is all
</I>&gt;<i> about?  What do DOWN and UP do here?  Is there a token in the
</I>&gt;<i> input called UP or DOWN?
</I>
It's just a notional thing; they don't actually exist as tokens in
the grammar or in any real way in ANTLR.

It might help if you imagined an ordinary (1-d) rule where each
token were succeded by a navigation operation:

For example:

 a : A B C ;

could (notionally) be written:

 a : A NEXT B NEXT C NEXT ;

NEXT simply indicates the normal behavior of advancing to the next
token.

However, when your tokens happen to be nodes in a tree, there are
additional navigation possibilities.  You could still use NEXT to
advance to the next sibling token (i.e. node), but you also have:

 * UP - moves to the parent of the current node

 * DOWN - moves to the first child of the current node

This is a bit like the way that zippers unravel a tree into a
sequence of navigation operations, though through a different axis.

A 1-d sequence is simply a special case of a large family of data
structures.  In principle, given appropriate navigation primitives,
this approach to parsing could be generalized to pretty much any
acyclic data structure.

&gt;<i> You aren't really parsing a tree, you are building a tree.
</I>&gt;<i> You are parsing a 1-D input and producing a tree output, right?
</I>&gt;<i> What am I missing here?
</I>
In this case he really is talking about parsing one tree directly
and outputting another.

&gt;<i>Andy,

</I>&gt;<i>    In one of the previous mails you mentioned about using Collections.Sort routine of java to replace an equivalent piece of code in C. I am really curious how would you go about doing this ? There can be any number of ways one could write a sorting algorithm and I am wondering if you really try to do some fancy token matching to determine that &quot;Aha this is indeed the xyz sorting algorithm&quot; and then replace it with one function call
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>I've done just a little of this, but yea, it does seem to be pretty 
impractical.
Here's one example where I map a couple of alternatives to a single 
function call:

for (v1=0; (v2 = getc(v3)) != '\n';)
        v1 = v1 * 10 + (v2 - '0');
---
for (v1=0; (v2 = getc(v3)) != EOF &amp;&amp; v2 != '\n';)
        v1 = v1 * 10 + (v2 - '0');
--&gt;
v1 = v3.readIntChars();

In this case, I think maybe it's useful - we may actually come across 
one of those patterns
of code in the future. On the other hand, here's a ridiculous rule that 
is so specific that it
will surely never match anything ever again:

while (true) {
        while (true) {
                printf(v5);
                v4 = 0;
                v1 = v2.readLine();
                break;
        }
        if (v3 == v1) {
                continue;
        }
        for (v3 = v1; isspace(*v3); v3++) {
                continue;
        }
        for (;isdigit(*v3); v3++) {
                v4 *= 10 + *v3 - '0';
        }
        if (*v3 == '\n') {
                return v4;
        }
        else {
                x2
        }
}

--&gt;
while (true) {
        System.out.print(v5);
        v1 = v2.readLine().trim();
        try {
                return Integer.parseInt(v1);
        }
        catch (NumberFormatException e) {
                x2
        }
}

The two rules above are both &quot;text-based&quot; rules, but I do have lots of 
rules that are not so simple
and so are written with Java code. Here, we're a lot more flexible. For 
example, I have a
TemporaryVariableRule that look for patterns things like:

String s = a;
s += &quot; &quot;;
s += c;
a = s;

...and removes the temporary variable s:
a += &quot; &quot;;
a += c;

(of course, there can be no other references to s). Since we're writing 
code, we have the
flexibility to say &quot;look for a variable that's assigned to some other 
value (&quot;s = a;&quot;), and later
an assignment back (&quot;a = s&quot;). Make sure the &quot;a&quot; never changes in 
between, and all assignments
to &quot;s&quot; can be combined. Make sure that &quot;s&quot; is never referenced anywhere 
else.

So all that is just capturing what a real person would do: notice cases 
where a temporary
variable is just making the code more complicated, and simplifying.

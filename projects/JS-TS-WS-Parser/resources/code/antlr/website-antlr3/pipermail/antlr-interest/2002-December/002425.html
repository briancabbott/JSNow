<PRE>Ter,

&gt;<i> I updated this java/action.g rule [...]
</I>&gt;<i> To allow the 3rd arg.  Hmm....
</I>
Oh no, that's definitely there.  Let me try to express this more 
clearly.  I tried two separate things, one with Java Antlr and one 
with C#.  Neither worked.

(1) For C#, I ported your changes to java/action.g to 
csharp/action.g.  In other words, I added your new AST_CONSTRUCTOR 
rule to the C# version.  This didn't work, but I didn't really expect 
it to, because Micheal had already implied it wouldn't until the 
2.7.2a6 C# codegen comes out.  And he has since confirmed that.

(2) For Java, I didn't have to change action.g at all, because you'd 
already done so.  I was just trying to use it.  I modified a grammar 
to pass a third argument to an AST constructor, and then tried to run 
java Antlr on it.  It didn't work.  In fact, I got the same syntax 
error as with the C#: &quot;unexpected ','&quot;.  This was why I asked, &quot;Is 
there something else one needs to do, to get Antlr to use the new 
action.g?&quot;  The answer is &quot;yes&quot; in the C# case because 2.7.2a6 isn't 
out yet.  But what about the Java case?

Maybe there are some crossed wires and I wasn't really using the Java 
2.7.2a6 codegen... but I definitely changed my grammar to 
say &quot;Language = Java&quot; instead of C#.

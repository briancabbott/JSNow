</I>
The latest daily release is too old for the fixes. And I had no success
in building my own ANTLR with Eclipse. Is there a wiki page about that
problem already?

&gt;&gt;<i> Then I've got this line:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> protected ITreeAdaptor adaptor = new DebugTreeAdaptor(dbg,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new CommonTreeAdaptor());
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The missing context may tell another story but, I don't see *anything*
</I>wrong
&gt;<i> with this line.
</I>
The location of dbg. dbg is a member of DebugParser, the parent parent
class. And in Ecma 334 is written:

&quot;A variable initializer for an instance field cannot reference the
instance being created. Thus, it is a compile-time error to reference
*this* in a variable initializer, as it is a compile-time error for a
variable initializer to reference any instance member through a
simple-name.&quot;

The simple-name part is violated.

&gt;&gt;<i> It is trying to initialize a member via the non-constructor
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way with a constructor-only argument, which of course the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compiler doesn't know about. I removed the assignment and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> added in each constructor the line:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> adaptor = new DebugTreeAdaptor(dbg, new CommonTreeAdaptor());
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Actually, in the one-parameter constructor I used &quot;null&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instead &quot;dbg&quot;. It would cause NullReferenceExceptions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everywhere, if the TreeAdaptor isn't set afterwards, but that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seems to be the consequence anyway, as this constructor
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chains to the one-argument base constructor (Interestingly,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the one-argument constructor has the line
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ruleMemo = new IDictionary[154+1];
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but the two-argument constructor does not. I'm further
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> astonished that no constructor chaining is done from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one-argument constructor to the two-argument constructor.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have a sample grammar that demonstrates what you feel is the
</I>problem
&gt;<i> here?.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I expected you might have sent me a grammar as you did previously.
</I>
My apologies. I assumed that my diagnostics would have been enough. I
attached both grammars, as the errors appear in different files. Use the
-debug option for generation.

Best regards,
Johannes Luber

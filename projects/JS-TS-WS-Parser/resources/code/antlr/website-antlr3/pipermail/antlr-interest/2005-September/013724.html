I have no problem with commercial software. The problems, as far as I'm 
concerned, are:

1) the beta expires after 7 days. This is hardly long enough to install 
it, let alone find out if it does anything useful.

2) No-one's going to evaluate a beta of commercial software without some 
idea of what it'll cost if it works.

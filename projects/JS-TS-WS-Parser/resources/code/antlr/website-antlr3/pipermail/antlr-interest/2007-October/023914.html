Sorry, by prototype I mean that I would write the same or equivalent
function in Netbeans IDE then place it Antlrworks.

I experience this problem *many* times.  The problem for me was two
fold.  First there was some embedded java that Antlrworks didn't agree
with.  No error was generated when I checked the grammar.  Fortunately
for me I knew that the last things I did were direct changes in the
grammar and embedded some java.  After making prototypes for each
function I believe that I either had a syntax error or a missing include
file.  I do not recall which.  Most often it was a syntax error.  The
second problem was the need to reboot the machine or change the port in
which the debugger worked.  I believed this particular error tied up the
port and it no longer became usable.  I changed the port in one of the
preferences and it would work or I would reboot.
To save myself time, I would most often change port numbers.  I learned
to prototype all my functions and before placing them in Antlrworks to
alleviate that problem.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Another newbie Q: AntlrWorks wants to do
remote debugging only on my Java-based grammar?

Howdy,

I've been building up a grammar, and I don't know if I've crossed a
magic threshold or if something else is going on. But suddenly, when I
tell AntlrWorks to debug my grammar, it generates, compiles, and then
goes into a &quot;Connecting...&quot; wait loop. After a bit, it times out and
complains that it:

  Cannot launch the debugger.
  Time-out waiting to connect to the remote parser.

This is surprising because I haven't told it to do &quot;Debug Remote...&quot; or
anything - I've got my .g file loaded, it uses Java as the underlying
language, and I want a local debugging session.
 
If I type in a trivial grammar (target: 'a' | 'b';) then debugging works
fine locally. For some reason my grammar is too complete, or uses some
mysterious feature (I just added @members{...} to my parser - does that
make a difference?) that causes it to want remote mode.
 
This would be acceptable if I had the first idea how to set up remote
mode - I'm not a java coder by profession, so I'm figuring things out as
I go.
 
Can anyone tell me:

1. How do I get back to local debugging for my grammar?; or

2. What features cause a java grammar to force remote debugging?; and

3. How to set up remote debugging on a Ubuntu linux system with Sun
Java5-jdk installed?

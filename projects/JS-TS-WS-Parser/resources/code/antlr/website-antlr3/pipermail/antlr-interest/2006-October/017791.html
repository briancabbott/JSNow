<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; I want to make multiple passes over a tree but only utilise parts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the tree for each pass so I've duplicated the tree grammar 3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; times , adding actions only for the parts that matter at each pass.
</I>&gt;<i>   I have already added a wiki entry about this on the to do list:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/allow+skipping+of+entire">http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/allow+skipping+of+entire</A>
</I>&gt;<i> +subtrees+during+tree+parsing
</I>
That's what I was trying with the  ^(TOKEN .*) -  I tried loads of
combinations, looking at the source to see if I was getting close, but it
was having none of it hehehe.. oh well!

&gt;<i> &gt; So the question is , how do you ignore (remove) whole branches of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tree? At the moment if I add a node into the parser output I have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to change all 3 tree walkers in response. If I know that the tokens
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that pass 1 will no longer be affected, how can I remove all the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unwanted rules from that grammar so It only looks at the tokens it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; needs?
</I>&gt;<i> I think what we really need is a filter mode for trees just like we
</I>&gt;<i> have for lexer's.  This would be almost a declarative approach where
</I>&gt;<i> you say what trees you want to match and what actions to execute when
</I>&gt;<i> you see it.  For example,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> tree grammar TP;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> options {filter=true;}
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IDENTITY
</I>&gt;<i> 	:	^(MULT i:INT j:INT)
</I>&gt;<i> {$i.text.equals(&quot;1&quot;)||$j.text.equals(&quot;1&quot;)}?
</I>&gt;<i> 		-&gt; i
</I>&gt;<i> 	;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> pretty sweet.   of course I need tree grammars to be able to generate
</I>&gt;<i> trees before I can do this.
</I>
Yup, that would be pretty sweet, at least you wouldn't have to include whole
trees of un-actioned tokens. I like that, for me that would pretty much
solve the whole single tree multiple pass problem.

So then.. When will it be ready? stop that slacking mate &amp; jump to it ;) LOL

&gt;<i> The idea will be that it tries all patterns looking for a match in
</I>&gt;<i> the order specified.  An index can be used to speedthings up by only
</I>&gt;<i> attempting rules on nodes in the tree that can possibly match.  For
</I>&gt;<i> example if there is only one MULT node in the entire tree, don't walk
</I>&gt;<i> the entire tree looking for that pattern.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> added this is a wiki entry:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/filter+tree+grammar+mode">http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/filter+tree+grammar+mode</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ter
</I>
It would definitely be a useful tool to have, you shouldn't have made the
beta so good, then I wouldn't think it was 100% complete with everything I
want LOL
;)

Cheers,
Rob

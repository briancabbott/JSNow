<PRE>I don't think I understand this.  Shouldn't IP address be defined as 
 
IPFRAG '.' IPFRAG '.' IPFRAG ''.' IPFRAG
 
where IPFRAG is fragment constrained to a maximum 3 digit integer 
You could later check to see if that value is 255 or less.
 
Would you look ahead to see if there were four dotted decimal integers before deciding to treat a number as a floating point or ip address?
Would that be painfully slow to check every time you came across a potential floating point number?

	I would like to have it as a lexer rule, but in my parser, there is a Floating_Point_Constant like

	Then when an IP appears in the stream, it is divided into serveral floating point tokens, but not a complete IP token
	
	Then I rewrite this rule to deal with double cases
	
	


fragment
IP_Address : ;



	Floating_Point_Constant:
	
	  ('0'..'9')+ '.' 
	
	  (
	
	       (('0'..'9')+ '.' ('0'..'9')+ '.' ('0'..'9')+) =&gt; ('0'..'9')+ '.' ('0'..'9')+ '.' ('0'..'9')+ {$type=IP_Address;}
	
	       |
	
	       ('0'..'9')* ('e'|'E')?;
	
	  )
	
	;
	
	This rule can deal with both cases well, but I need to define a token IP_Address first, then comes the story.
	
	

	If I define two rules for floating point and ip address respectively, seems one of them doesn't work properly.

		 no lexer rule corresponding to token: IP_Address 
		Everytime when I define a token in token section, it always issues this kind of warning. 
		I hate warnings, is there any way to remove it?
		


	Don't define it in the tokens section, but as a lexer rule and it will go away.

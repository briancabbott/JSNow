I had an example that was much more of theoretical interest (I do not 
recall right now, but could look it up). On the more practical side same 
grammars might look nicer if you had such a feature.

Admitted, this is not a really practical example, but consider the 
following grammar:

{
     int cnt = 0;
}

LANGUAGE
     : ( SHORTWORD ) =&gt; SHORTWORD { System.out.println(&quot;SHORT&quot;); }
     | LONGWORD { System.out.println(&quot;LONG&quot;); }
     ;

protected SHORTWORD : { cnt = 0; } ( {cnt &lt; 1000}? '*' { cnt++; } )+ '#' ;
protected LONGWORD : { cnt = 0; } ( {cnt &lt; 10000}? '*' { cnt++; } )+ '#' ;

It describes a language with two words:
1.) SHORTWORD: exactly 1000 '*' followed by a single '#'
2.) LONGWORD: exactly 10000 '*' followed by a single '#'

While the are certainly other grammars that describe this language, this 
one seems to be the most natural, but does not work, because semantic 
predicates (like {cnt &lt; 1000}?) rely on semantic actions ({ cnt++; }, { 
cnt = 0; }).

I have the same experience. But consider extremely large amounts of 
input to be parsed. In this case it is prohibitve to generate an AST 
because of the memory issue. As a very practical exmaple I have parsing 
of the AMM (Aircraft Maintenance Manual) which is available in SGML 
(very hard to parse, really). I parsed this a few years using ANTLR, but 
its size normally is around 100MB. A few years ago my machine had 128MB 
of RAM! You see what I mean?

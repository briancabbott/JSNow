<PRE>  As has already been noted, the common use of multicores or multiple
systems is parallel make (or ant or maven or what ever).  Multiple files can
be compiled in multiple threads of control.  This makes compilation
parallelizable to the number of files.

  It should also be possible to make use of pipeline parallelism.  As far as
I know, no one has done this because compiling is not generally something
that people are willing to put a lot of effort into speeding up beyond
parallel make.  But it should be possible to create a pipeline that
processes multiple files on a shared memory multi-core.  One state could do
parse and AST construction.  Another state could do control flow/data flow
construction and optimizatoin and another state could do code generation and
target dependent optimization.

  The obvious argument against this is that compilers are already complex
enough without making them into multi-process applications.  This would
probably only be justified for something like logic synthesis compilers that
are generating large net lists (and then you can't store things in memory).

  In summary, at least pipeline parallelism is possible, but it would
probably be a bad idea.

</I>&gt;<i> I have a mechanism where I spawn multiple threads to parse multiple
</I>&gt;<i> files.
</I>&gt;<i> It speeds things up quite a bit, mostly because doing it single-threaded
</I>&gt;<i> is I/O bound. With the multiple threads, file reading and parsing can
</I>&gt;<i> happen in parallel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for multiple cores, I don't know how much multithreading will help.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From what I've read, it's not easy to get Java to utilize multiple
</I>&gt;<i> CPUs.
</I>&gt;<i> I would think you'd have to have incredibly huge input for ANTLR to use
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of CPU to parse it. Anyway, it's pretty easy to try out
</I>&gt;<i> multithreading in Java, so just try it and see what happens.

<PRE>Thanks Michael J for responding yet again to my problem of processing
asm statements in C/C++.
 
I tried finding the examples you mentioned in CSharpLexer.g but either
I didn't find the correct file or if I did find it I couldn't find
anything similar to my situation of trying to exclude asm statements
(in the lexer as if they were comments) without ending up with a
nondetermism warning (with ID).
 
Although I can get my definitions to work in the lexer (by placing
productions in the right order) it doesn't seem possible to suppress
any unwanted (unnecessary) nondetermism warning in the lexer.
 
I have already tried to deal with asm statements in the parser, but
whatever I do I come against some nondeterminism or other so I have
reluctantly come to the conclusion that it cannot be done cleanly if
at all in ANTLR. 
 
I think the main reason is that as I am not able to parse the asm
statements themselves I have to be able to accept any characters
either to the first RPAREN or to the first RCURLY (allowing Newlines
and hoping that asm statements don't contain parenthese or curly
brackets!).
 
Individual compilers have their own syntax. It seems to me that I
would have to be able to deal with any definition something like
these,
 
asm-definition
     asm ( string-literal ) ;               // C++ standard
     asm { any characters - including newlines }    // MSVC 6.0
     asm ( any characters - including newlines )    // Other compilers
     asm any characters up to newline                 // MSVC 6.0
 
Thanks. Is Version 3 any better in this respect?
 
David Wigg

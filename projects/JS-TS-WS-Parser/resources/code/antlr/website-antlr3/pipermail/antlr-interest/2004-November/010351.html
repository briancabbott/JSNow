<PRE>
Let's see your pattern match cope with the following line of (*real*)
code from a (*real*) language ...

REM: REM = REM( 85, 17) ;* REM calculate the remainder

Where REM is sequentially a label, a variable, a function, and a
statement. I think that pretty much this statement is in the compiler's
regression tests to make sure it works properly :-)

Cheers,
Wol

&gt;<i> Yes, I think that's it exactly.  It seems to me that something like a

You've just given the rationale for running the hell away from the
insanity
caused by &quot;pattern-matching-and-replacement&quot; approaches... They fail to
hold up under the pressure of non-trivial systems.  The very fact that
their behavior is incestuously emergent destroys any semblance of
robustness in the face of change, clarity in debuggability, etc.  The
simplest example of this nightmare is XSLT.  Even hardcore (from a rigor
POV) approaches like prolog work well only for constrained domains and
contexts).

</I>doesn't
&gt;<i> change much.

Multiple phases.


&gt;<i> I don't want to &quot;walk the tree&quot;, I want to &quot;search the tree for

&gt;<i> and make replacements&quot;.
</I>
That's exactly what a tree walker gives you.

Take care,

</I>Well, as for the book, I'd have to buy it first, which is expensive and 
inconvenient - I'll probably get it eventually, but this project won't 
wait for my studies. As for the website, I find it rather difficult to 
navigate; when I search for &quot;fragment&quot;, for example, I get a Wiki page 
and a bunch of posts on antlr-interest, and the usual result of my 
searches is a 404... I'd prefer something more organized and 
authoritative, but well, I suppose that's what the book is for...

</I>Ah, now it makes sense - thanks.

	Bye

<PRE>Hi everybody,

(1) I am interested in contributing some patches to ANTLR. But, the 
makefile seems not to work on Windows, with or without Cygwin. Since 
ANTLR is pure Java, I am wondering if the ANTLR developers would 
consider switching to Apache Jakarta ANT for building? I could submit 
the ANT build script.

(2) It would be easier to understand the ANTLR source code if it were 
divided into more packages. It is particularly confusing to have the 
ANTLR runtime library and the code generator source code together in the 
same package. Would it be possible to move the classes that support 
antlr.Tool to their own package (antlr.tool.*)? Presumably antlr.Tool 
itself would have to stay in the &quot;antlr&quot; package for backwards 
compatibility with the ANTLR ANT Task and IDE integration, but I am not 
sure.

I think it would also be nice to seperate the packages inside the 
runtime library for the lexer, parser, and AST support (antlr.lexer, 
antlr.parser, and antlr.ast?) Obviously, moving any of the runtimes 
classes would break runtime compatibility, but perhaps it could be done 
for 3.0 and beyond?

Thanks,
Brian

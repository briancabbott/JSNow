<PRE>I was told this is the first version with signed runtime support
assemblies for CSharp... Is there a regular schedule associated with
builds? Do you have any approximation for release date? 

Thank you,

On that note, the last intermediate build which I know of that it 
contains a working C# target is the last build of 2007. If any newer one

still works it is purely by chance, as I haven't gotten around to 
integrate Ter's latest changes.

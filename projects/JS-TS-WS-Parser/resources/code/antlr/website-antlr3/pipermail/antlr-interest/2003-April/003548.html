<PRE>Okay. Let's take &quot;if then else&quot; syntax. The assorted variants can be

IF A EQ B THEN
   C = 3
   D = 4
END ELSE
   E = 5
   F = 6
END

or

IF A EQ B THEN C = 3; D = 4 ELSE E = 5; F = 6
 or

IF A EQ B
   THEN C = 3; D = 4
   ELSE E = 5; F = 6

(or other assorted variants...)

This then goes through my parser rules (note that I haven't got round to
sorting out assigns as in my example, but the grammar won't &quot;Tool&quot;
without the warnings...)

statement : ( inputst | printst | exitst | ifst | loopst | &quot;NULL&quot; ) ;
statement_line : (statement ( SEMI! statement)* ) ;
statement_list : ( (statement_line (EOL!)+ )+ ) ;

If you look at the output from that, both statement_line and
statement_list just give you a degenerate tree consisting of a list of
statements. That's why my treeparser was presumably blowing up. If you
look back to my original post, the treeparser rules were

statement_line : ( ( statement)+ ) ; 
statement_list : ( (statement_line )+ ) ; 

Which blew up with the non-determinism warning...Rob's post gave me the
hint I needed - eliminate one of the treeparser rules and the warning
goes away. Now that I'm working on creating a virtual root for
statement_list, that's an alternative way of making the non-determinism
go away (and may prove to be the only route to a working grammar), but
my example above is certainly an exception to &quot;one parser rule to one
treeparser rule&quot; - the parser was doing exactly what I expected/wanted
and the treeparser was ambiguous.

Cheers,
Wol

&gt;<i> This is a counter-example! The problem is that both SEMI and EOL are
</I>end-of-statement 
&gt;<i> markers, but they can (sometimes, not always) modify the preceding
</I>control
structure as 
&gt;<i> well.
</I>
Can you show some examples?  Both rules and example code to parse.

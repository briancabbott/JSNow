Hmmm. If you are saying ANTLR generates a CST (aka. parse tree or
concrete syntax tree) by default and the JJTree way is to generate an
AST, you may be right Ter.

Now, generating an AST rather than a CST is easily done in ANTLR with
custom tree-building actions. This should be doable with
implementation language-agnostic syntax in ANTLR 3. That leaves
visitors...

Despite the elegance and utility of the treeparser-from-grammar
feature, it may be prudent to provide support for auto-visitor
generation *also* with ANTLR 3. One big issue is that, ANTLR's AST
interface isn't particularly custom, hetero-AST friendly and, getting
to play nice with the visitor model seems to need custom hetero-ASTs.
So we get into, attributed ANTLR grammars and {ANTLR-driven}
attributed grammar processors that read the grammar and generates AST
nodes classes and visitors in addition to the Lexer/Parser/TreeParsers.

Cheers,

Micheal

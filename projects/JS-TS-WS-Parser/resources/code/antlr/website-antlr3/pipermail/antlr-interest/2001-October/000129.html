<PRE>Hi,

Just felt it was time for a snapshot. Get it at:

<A HREF="http://wwwhome/~klaren/antlr/">http://wwwhome/~klaren/antlr/</A>

Changes:

- Automake got ditched (configure too for now)
  C++/java configuration in Config.make file, try running make a toplevel.
- Makefiles for examples
- Doc updates (see <A HREF="http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/antlr/support-docs/index.html">http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/antlr/support-docs/index.html</A>)
  (and also the normal docs here and there)
- deprecated set/getASTNodeFactory methods in favour of set/getASTFactory
  (for consistency) (old ones still there no worries)
- Here and there rearranged stuff for inlining. (Still have to do a lot
  though)
- Fixed some mishap with CommonASTWithHiddenTokens seemed it triggered a gcc
  bug (2.95/3.0) where vtable didn't get instantiated.
- Updated some error messages from antlr
- The LA_k optimizations suggested by Ruslan (still one minor issue with 
  lexers)
- Removed down and right initializers from BaseAST copy constructor, they
  wreak havoc in relation to dupTree.
- CharScanner moved lot of small methods back to header, lessened
  circular dependency with MismatchedCharException.
- (JAVA) Added ASTPair construction optimization suggested by Sander M&#228;gi.
- Added a warning for usage of labeled subrules. (these are unimplemented)
- Added missing initializer for factory in TreeParser constructor.
- Added the possiblity to escape # characters. Added more preprocessor stuff
  to be skipped. Changed error for ## into a warning.
- Some heterogeneous AST fixes. Heterogeneous ast example works once more
  (C++)
- Added warning for tokens defined outside the tokens section. Thanks to
  Michael Schmitt for the pointer. People will probably hate me for this =)
- Optimize number of AST declarations generated code should be much tighter now
- added patch to allow reset of lexer object
- use buffered IO...gets 2x performance boost reading grammars.
- Updated a lot of #include &quot;antlr/xx&quot; to #include &lt;antlr/xx&gt;. Also
  updated some copyrights.
- Small MSVC fixes updates. (thanks to Jean-Daniel Fekete)
- Fixed some oopses. 
- #if-0-ed the deprecated getErrorMessage method. 
- Also preprocess preheader actions and preambles for treegeneration code.
- Robustified action.g - if currentRule = 0 a fitting error message is
  printed.
- Print timestamp and build number in the copyright headers.

There's still a lot of patches and stuff on the shelves. Don't worry if
it's not inhere yet.

 'And this 'rebooting' business? Give it a good kicking, do you?' 'Oh, no,
  of course, we ... that is ... well, yes, in fact,' said Ponder. 'Adrian
    goes round the back and ... er ... prods it with his foot. But in a
     technical way,' he added. --- From: Hogfather by Terry Pratchett.

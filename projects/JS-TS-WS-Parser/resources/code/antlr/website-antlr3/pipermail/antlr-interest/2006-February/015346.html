In my infinite naivet&#233; I actually succeded ;)

Alright, the first version is now working.
What I do is the following:
Upon entering a rule (in codegen.g) I do a #rule.findFirstType(BANG)  
to determine whether this rule has a bang somewhere inside.
If that's true (i.e. the result non-null) I turn on a flag that gets  
set as an attribute in the lexerRule template.
Then I create a new empty StringBuffer.
If I see a bang attached to an atom I grab the text from start to  
getCharIndex()-1 and put that into the StringBuffer. After the
match I set start=getCharIndex(). Repeat.
At the end of the rule I emit a token with the new emit method that  
takes a String as parameter instead of start,stop.

Done. Works beautifully. Does it sound the least sensible, or did I  
do something horrible? ;)

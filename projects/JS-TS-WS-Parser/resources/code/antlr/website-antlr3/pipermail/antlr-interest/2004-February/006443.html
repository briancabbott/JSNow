<PRE>Hi,

Moving 100% away from STL is not an option. You will have to keep a local
modified copy of ANTLR to get that. It is probably quite easy to make a
sed/perl/tcl script that patches the antlr runtime to use whatever
replacements you want (as long as they're STL'ish enough)

Although you seem to have missed the point of the custom InputBuffer (as
Loring pointed out). You will have to do a little bit more work to
initialize a lexer see for an example the calc example, one of the Main.c's
in it uses a different InputBuffer. You may have to remove the convenience
constructor from the lexer that uses a istream but that's a trivial change.
Not using istreams is easy even in the current runtime.

</I>
This is indeed the best candidate I've seen so far. But requiring it by
default is excessive.

&gt;<i> &gt; It seems that the choice within your company to move out of the way of

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understand this decision I'm not sure whether its a good idea for antlr.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> May be somebody works with wxWindows. This great framework have own String

</I>&gt;<i> project STL classes???
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And now we are FORCED to include STL classes because ANTL CANNOT be tuned to
</I>&gt;<i> avoid them. You see?
</I>
You're free to modify the ANTLR runtime. So forced is a big word. A facade
will mean that in all kinds of places an extra indirection will happen. I'd
rather use templates for this.

I don't particularly see it as a benefit of a library to use it's own
homecooked implementations of streams/vectors/whatever. C++ is about to
move out of that stone-age era. It looks like that even the biggest STL
saboteur (Microsoft) finally made a decent compiler and with the many
platforms gcc is available on people should not have an excuse to use a
stone-age compiler/stdlib. Now we can only pray that Microsoft switches to
ELF and gets rid of the bad joke called DLL's then I'll be happier.

&gt;<i> And make all ANTLR code depended ONLY on this interface.
</I>
I'd suggest you have a look at InputBuffer.hpp and friends. It's basically
what you suggest.

Moving away from std:string does not really appeal to me. Making the string
class configurable via template parameters will almost certainly happen in
a runtime rewrite. Then again patching std::string out of the runtime with
a sed/perl/tcl script is probably doable in an hour.

Cheers,

Ric

<PRE>Hi all,

   I'm parsing a format called SMILES.  It's a notation for
writing molecules as a single line of ASCII.  Details at

<A HREF="http://daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html">http://daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html</A>
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</A> 
Simplified_molecular_input_line_entry_specification

I've written parsers for it using other parser generators
but was hoping to use ANTLR for better cross-language output
and simplifications I can do using tree grammars.

My previous parsers were state dependent, and use only 1
character lookahead.  This is easily handled by most of
the parsers I know about for this format, which are
hand-written using a bunch of switch statements.

I've looked through the back archives and found several people
asking about how to change the lexer state, but I didn't
understand what to do from the responses I found.  I would
appreciate some advice or pointers to existing code which
does something like switching lexers, or adding lexer state, in ANTLR.

=======

That was the summary.  Here's the tedious details.

The two main responses in the mailing list are of the form:

   - create two lexers and have the parser switch between them

   - the more provocative statement of Jim Idle:

     Perhaps, someday, the world can require that any 'new' [insert
     post-modernistic interpolation of 'reality' here ;-)] languages
    have to have a sane ANTLR parser as proof of their ability not
    to drive anyone with any sense mad  ... &lt;duck&gt;

As he then dissed Python (&quot;shoot anyone deciding that
indenting should be lexically/grammatically significant on
the vague justification that it makes people format code -
something that a good programmer should do naturally anyway.&quot;)
I feel comfortable not seeing the crouching duck. :)


I couldn't find information how to generate multiple lexers.
There's some old documentation for that in ANTLR 2's
doc/streams.html but I see nothing in the ANTLR book which
talks about that possibility.  (In general the index is
lacking.  Eg, there's no index entry for 'channels',
which does exist in the book, so I don't know if the
lack of information about 'streams' means it doesn't exist.)


I would like some advice, suggestions, pointers to working
code, etc.


So that you can see my problem, here are a few examples
of SMILES strings and why I use lexer states to handle it.
I'm deliberately lying about the grammar because the full
details depends on chemistry that isn't relevant.  (Ie,
I'm not going to talk about &quot;aromaticity&quot;.)

Here's a simple atom:
    C     this is methane, a carbon with the default of 4 hydrogens
   [CH4]  this is also methane, a carbon with 4 explicit hydrogens

   [13C]  this is a carbon 13 atom with zero hydrogens.
            (Carbon has many isotopes.  The most common is C-12.
             The ratio between C-12 and radioactive C-14 is used
             for radiocarbon dating.)

   [C-]  this is a carbon atom with zero hydrogens and a charge of -1
   [C--]  this is a carbon atom with zero hydrogens and a charge of -2
   [C-2]  this is a carbon atom with zero hydrogens and a charge of -2


   C-C    this is carbon bonded to another carbon through a single bond.
           Each atom has 3 hydrogens (with the implicit rules,
           the default valence of carbon is 4, the bond takes
           1 electron from each, so there are 3 electrons remaining)

   C=C   this is a carbon bonded to another carbon through a double bond
           Each atom has 2 hydrogens.

You can see at this point that there is ambiguity between &quot;-&quot;
meaning &quot;single bond&quot; and &quot;-&quot; meaning &quot;charge of -1&quot;.  The
bond notation only occurs outside of the '[]' notation, and
the charge notation only occurs inside of '[]'.

   CC     this is another way of writing &quot;C-C&quot;.  If two atoms are
           side by side then the default rule is to assume it's
           a single bond.

   CCCCCC  This is hexane.  6 carbon atoms in a chain, with a single
         bond between successive atoms

   C1CCCCC1  This is a ring of carbons.  The '1' connects the first
         carbon atom to the last, making a ring.  These are called
         ring closures but they don't necessarily close rings.

   C9CCCCC9  This is another way to describe the same ring.
         I can use the digits '0'..'9'.

   C%43CCCCC%43  The notation '%' DIGIT DIGIT is for ring closure
         numbers from 10 to 99, inclusive.

This last SMILES string should tokenize to
   ATOM &quot;C&quot;
   RING &quot;43&quot;
   ATOM &quot;C&quot;
   ATOM &quot;C&quot;
   ATOM &quot;C&quot;
   ATOM &quot;C&quot;
   ATOM &quot;C&quot;
   RING &quot;43&quot;


   C.C    This is two methanes.  The &quot;.&quot; is a way to say that
         successive atoms are not bonded together.

   C1.C1  This is another way to write &quot;CC&quot;.  The ring closure in
           this case connects the two carbons together, even
           though there is no explicit connection via the '.'

    C1.C12.C23.C34.C45.C5  This is the same as &quot;CCCCCC&quot;.  The
       ring closures connect the atoms despite the &quot;.&quot;s that
       are supposed to separate them.

This last case should tokenize to:
    ATOM &quot;C&quot;
    RING &quot;1&quot;
    DOT
    ATOM &quot;C&quot;
    RING &quot;1&quot;
    RING &quot;2&quot;
    DOT
    ATOM &quot;C&quot;
    RING &quot;2&quot;
    RING &quot;3&quot;
    DOT
    ...


Finally,

    C-1.C-1  is the same as &quot;C-C&quot;, which is the same as &quot;CC&quot;.
        This specifies the bond type (&quot;-&quot; or &quot;=&quot; for single
        or double) for the bond created by the ring closure.
        The default is single.

    C=1.C=1  is the same as &quot;C=C&quot;.


    C-67-8[C-].[14C-1]-6.[12C-2]7.[CH2-3]-8

This is very hairy, and should okenize somewhat as:

   ATOM &quot;C&quot; with default hydrogen rules
     closure (&quot;-&quot;, &quot;6&quot;)
     closure (&lt;default&gt;, &quot;7&quot;)
     closure (&quot;-&quot;, &quot;8&quot;)
   ATOM &quot;C&quot; with no hydrogens and a charge of -1
   DOT
   ATOM &quot;C&quot; with no hydrogens, isotope number 14 and charge of -1
     closure (&quot;-&quot;, &quot;6&quot;)
   DOT
   ATOM &quot;C&quot; with no hydrogens, isotope number 12 and charge of -2
     closure (&lt;default&gt;, &quot;7&quot;)
   DOT
   ATOM &quot;C&quot; with two hydrogens and a charge of -3)
      closure (&quot;-&quot;, &quot;8&quot;)

You can see my problem.  Depending on where I am,
&quot;-2&quot; is parsed as &quot;charge of -2&quot; or &quot;single bond ring closure
with identifer 2&quot;.

If I use '0'...'9'+ to tokenize the isotope field, like in [12C],
then it will also parse the 12 in

   C12.C1.C2

If I instead let the parser do everything, so the lexer
items are '-', and '0'..'9', then it will be annoyingly
tedious in the parser to have to reassemble the characters,
because  '[238U]' will be parsed using

atom_in_brackets: '[' isotope? SYMBOL hydrogen? charge? ']';
isotope: DIGIT*; // will need to combine the tokens to get the value
SYMBOL: 'A'..'Z' 'a'..'z'? ;
hydrogen: 'H' DIGIT*;  // again, will combine the tokens
charge: MINUS DIGIT*
       | PLUS DIGIT* ;

atom_list: (atom closure*)*;
closure: DIGIT | '%' DIGIT DIGIT;


I'm pretty sure this will work, but it ends up pushing all
of the work into the parser.  That seems like a lot of
waste because I'm basically using the parser as a lexer.
While in a yacc-style parser it's very easy to define the
two or three lexer states I need.  When I see '[' I switch
to a &quot;parsing the inside of []s&quot; state, and when I see
the closing ']' I switch back.

What should I do?

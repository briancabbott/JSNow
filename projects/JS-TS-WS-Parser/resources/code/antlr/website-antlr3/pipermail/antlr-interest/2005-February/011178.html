Ugh.  There's a *BIG* problem with that!  One of the core tenets of PCCTS
and Antlr has always been that it's absolutely unacceptable for Antlr and
the usage of Antlr to be held hostage.  That's why they were put into the
public domain in the first place.  That's also part of the reason why
Terence is literally writing all of the code for Antlr v3 by himself and
making all of the final decisions himself (after voluminous input from a
number of us wackos over the last 15 years or so :-).

Now, some lawyers freak out about the public domain part [gee, which part
of utterly and completely free is so hard for them to understand?], so the
Antlr v3.0 rewrite will be released under a BSD-style license.

Take care,
	John

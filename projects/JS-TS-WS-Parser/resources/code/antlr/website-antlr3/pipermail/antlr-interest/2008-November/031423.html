<PRE>Hi Matt,



Had exactly the same problem.

What you need to do is

&quot;Add EOF to the end of your top-level parser rule.&quot;,

As Gavin had told me.



Gavin - thanks again!



Enjoy,

Vitaliy

Subject: [antlr-interest] ANTLR not reporting error for malformed program



I know I saw something about this on the ANTLR web site a while back, but I can't find it now for the life of me.  I have some program text that does not conform to my grammar.  If thought of as a long string, about the first half of the string conforms to the cfg but then does something blatantly wrong from a grammar standpoint.  When ANTLR processes the program it consumes and parses the valid part of the program and then stops as if only the first half of the program string was the entire program string.  I do not see tokens pass by for the 2nd half of the malformed program (and as consiquence, no error is generated).  Can someone point me to the part of the web site that discusses this issue?

Thanks,
Matt

There are a couple of &quot;secret ways&quot; that might help you here :)

The first is that in ANTLR, any rule that starts with a leading 
uppercase character is a lexer rule, and anything with a leading 
lowercase character is a parser rule.  You should try to keep the 
lexer as simple as possible, and in particular avoid creating 
multiple top-level lexer rules that can match the same input 
(which in general means that a non-fragment lexer rule should not 
refer to any other non-fragment lexer rules).  (Almost all of the 
rules you posted earlier look like they should be parser rules.)

The second is that ~ only operates on sets, not sequences.  In the 
lexer, that means that ~ will only work on individual characters; 
in the parser, that means that ~ will only work on individual 
tokens.

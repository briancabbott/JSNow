<PRE>Thanks, Terry. That helps me along.

I keep poking along and keep ending up with more questions. I'm at least
generating output with a simple simple template now!

(1) I see that you mention tree construction is far superior. (I've got a
hunch that this leads into my next quesion, but I'll ask anyway.) If we're
able to generate output with StringTemplate, why do I want to shape the AST?
(Truly clueless on my end.)

(2) Will I be able to generate code from StringTemplate for most &quot;compiler&quot;
type projects? (I'm putzing with a BASIC-ish language.)  I think the part
I'm concerned about is that I'll have byte, int, string types, etc.
Operations such as &quot;plus&quot; vary based on data types. Can StringTemplate
handle that - or should I be working on a tree walker and embeded Java code
to track data types? Once I've identified what is being added to what, then
I could use the template to generate code.

(3) With BASIC, the colon is optional; a new line typically ends a
statement; and (maybe) there is a line continuation character? How is that
handled appropriately? I'm going to try &quot;SEPARATOR = ':' | NL&quot; and then use
&quot;SEPARATOR+&quot; at the end of a statement. I have no clue on the line
continuation... do I even want to try at this point in time?

Thanks as always - I'm hoping someday I actually &quot;get&quot; it.  :-)
-Rob

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Rob!  Ok, got the wiki started and added a v2 versus v3 page:

</I>&gt;<i> +v2+and+v3
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We need a migration page too.  I know lots of people have made some
</I>&gt;<i> notes, let's start collecting them!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've seen that string template has it's own docs, so I suspect that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; once I get that far, I can use that for reference (and from what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've seen as examples so far, it looks pretty straight forward).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i should also have a paper out in draft form very shortly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Q2) Once I've produced all the code (future task), how would I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dump out my variable declarations? In the scope is there an &quot;@done&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; production where I can drop in some code to generate that output?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Or, quite possibly, a string template reference?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You eventually call .toString on the outer most template. Just put an
</I>&gt;<i> action somewhere to create that string and send it to a file.  There
</I>&gt;<i> is an @finally {...}Action for rules that is executed when the rule
</I>&gt;<i> exits if you want.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Q3) Also, when I'm in ANTLR Works, is there some way to work with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a template (group) file?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not yet. Jean Bovet and I are talking about this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I see the example for &quot;cminus&quot; uses multiple group templates, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there is a separate Java program setting that up. When I've started
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; monkeying with templates, it starts looking for template files
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; named after each individual template - but I couldn't figure out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; either where they need to be or what they should be named. I'm just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trying to figure out where ANTLR Works stops and Eclipse begins...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> you are specifically loading a template group files with a reader so
</I>&gt;<i> you or specifying the location. Do not use the StringTempalteGroup
</I>&gt;<i> constructors that do not tak a group file format.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Q4) I think I just need verification on this: Those productions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that aren't in caps (invokes other productions maybe) return an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; object that has a String Template in the &quot;.st&quot; portion
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the return  argument is called $st not &quot;.st&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the productions that are in CAPS (somewhat more in the constant
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; realm) do not have String Templates, but they do have a &quot;.text&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; node that contains the value. What is returned and what is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available on these nodes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CAPS implies token. lowercase implies rule reference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Q5) Oh yeah, on a purely not getting it scale, can I declare a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; global scope (this is assembly after all) and keep the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; initialization of the variables outside of the program declaration
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; itself? I think it may be a tad bit cleaner. I tried something like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the snippet below, but the global_scope itself (a Stack) never got
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; initialized.  This was placed before the program production but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; after the options declaration.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     scope global {
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         List variables;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     }
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     @init {
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         $global::variables = new ArrayList();
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   my recommendation is that you do not play with &quot;scopes&quot; until you
</I>&gt;<i> really know what to doing. Using instance variables.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Q6) What the heck is channel 99? Are there others?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   all white spacecharacters are sent to the parser on a hidden
</I>&gt;<i> channel so that the parser has them but does not parse them. It is
</I>&gt;<i> like listening to a different radio channel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Shoot, as usual, this grew. Sorry and thanks in advance for your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; advice!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My pleasure.
</I>&gt;<i> Ter

<PRE>This quite often happens because of a bad lexer that has an empty rule:

 

R : ;

 

This will currently generate code that just hangs trying to match nothing forever. Then it will time out on the connection (which happens in the parser not the lexer) and forever after, you will not be able to connect.

Hi Michael!

Do you have sure that the port isn't being used by your OS?
If your OS is Windows, type netstat -aon | find /i &quot;49100&quot; in the prompt.
If true, then kill it.

After this, run your application and go to ANTLRWorks in menu Debugger -&gt; Debug Remote and click &quot;Connect&quot; button.
For view debugger graph in ANTLRWorks, go to the tab &quot;Debugger&quot; and click in the arrow &quot;=&gt;&quot;.

I hope help you.

Cheers,

Marcelo

address localhost
port    49100

I've got my grammar all setup now, and I was even able to find a fix for a compilation problem by
adding fragment above the LETTER entry.

That said, now I'd like to be able to feed my grammar various inputs and see how it deals with them.
 When I go to run though, it says &quot;Cannot launch the debugger Time-out waiting to connect to the
remote parser&quot;. I found some other posts about it and took the following steps.

1. Rebooted computer multiple times.
2. Restarted ANTLRWorks 1.3 multiple times.
3. Port forwarded 49100 on my router. (I think this was unnecessary though, doesn't the localhosts
mean it's trying to connect to the remote parser on my own computer?)
4. Tried running it with my computer's local static IP address in instead of localhost.

None of the above had any effect on the problem. I'm not really sure why it's occurring! Any help
would be nice, thanks.

<PRE>Hi Scott,

&gt;<i> &gt; GPL'ed applications can have binary dependencies. Ergo, many GPL'ed 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; apps run on (i.e. have a dependency on) Windows, OSX and/or 
</I>&gt;<i> Java for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instance. That being the case, the dependency of a GPL'ed 
</I>&gt;<i> application 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on the ANTLR v3 runtime library is a non-issue as one can always 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distribute the runtime library binaries with the GPL'ed application.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't believe this is true.  Here is a quote:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;It has always been the FSF's position that dynamically 
</I>&gt;<i> linking applications to libraries creates a single work 
</I>&gt;<i> derived from both the library code and the application code. 
</I>&gt;<i> The GPL requires that all derivative works be licensed under 
</I>&gt;<i> the GPL, an effect which can be described as 'hereditary.'&quot;
</I>
The FSF statement above is advocating free software. It also says that
derivatives of GPL works must also be GPL. Nothing about external library
dependencies.

&gt;<i> Dependencies on Windows, Java, gcc, etc. fall under the following GPL
</I>&gt;<i> exception:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;However, as a special exception, the source code distributed 
</I>&gt;<i> need not include anything that is normally distributed (in 
</I>&gt;<i> either source or binary form) with the major components 
</I>&gt;<i> (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on 
</I>&gt;<i> which the executable runs, unless that component itself 
</I>&gt;<i> accompanies the executable.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, if you are linking to an external library, it must be 
</I>&gt;<i> either GPL or GPL-compatible.
</I>
Not really. You just need to insert an exception notice for that library in
your license (as with source code works, the copyright owner's permission is
needed for distribution).

<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#FSWithNFLibs">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#FSWithNFLibs</A>

The above exception is required in the GPL itself else the GPL would be
irrelevant. I'm guessing no one would use it if they had to distribute an
entire OS/platform with every GPL'ed work.

&gt;<i> ANTLR v3's license is the 
</I>&gt;<i> 'new' BSD license, however, and as such, is compatible with the GPL.
</I>
Yes, in as much as it doesn't prevent the re-licensing that GPL requires for
source code works.

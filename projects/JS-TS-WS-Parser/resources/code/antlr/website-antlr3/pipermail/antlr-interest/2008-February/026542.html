 &gt;tree parser. this would allow total control over the node types

Way back in the very early beta days of ANTLR3, I used it to parse 
a fairly simple DSL, generating C++ source and header files as 
outputs.

Since StringTemplate and ASTs were new and unfamiliar to me at the 
time (and there was almost no documentation), I didn't use them; 
instead writing things the ANTLR2 way by using embedded code 
fragments.

It was very straightforward to do something like:
   { AddParameter($type.text, $name.text); }
to add a newly-parsed parameter from the source language to the 
in-memory data structures that modelled the content.

At the end of the whole process, I called the &quot;WriteSourceFile&quot; 
and &quot;WriteHeaderFile&quot; routines, each of which iterated through the 
data structure and generated the appropriate output.  (I probably 
could have done it in one pass, but speed wasn't a priority.)

So it's certainly possible to parse into custom data structures; 
I'm not really sure what you're having trouble with.

(Nowadays I probably would end up using an AST, but I'd still not 
use StringTemplate, since I'm primarily using the C target and 
there isn't a port yet.  I also wouldn't have used a tree parser, 
because I still haven't seen any point in using them :)  I 
probably would have used scopes more, though, avoiding the need to 
track some of the context outside the parser.)

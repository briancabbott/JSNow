</I>
I haven't played with v3 yet (ok, well I have within the bounds of 
AntlrWorks :).  Weren't you going to be generating ASTs of some sort that 
would then be fed into different StringTemplate's, in which case the 
transformation would be written there, or as this inline with the grammar or 
something such?  Sounds interesting and useful :)

&gt;<i>   thanks for the encouragement.  I memorized the keyboard and one

</I>&gt;<i> Are you able to use emacs with the new keyboard too?
</I>
Able, yes but I certainly don't when vim's available!! ;) I remember it being 
a pain at first, but after a while it's second nature.  Some of the 
combinations are awkword and some are better... but that's to be expected.

Thanks!

<PRE>Hi Jose,

By &quot;free&quot;, do you mean &quot;gratis&quot;? That's what I understand - if I mean
&quot;libre&quot; I always write &quot;Free&quot;. Is that half the confusion here?

By the way, Prashant, (not that I plan to buy it) will Antlr Studio be
&quot;open&quot;? Again, I distinguish between &quot;open&quot; and &quot;Open&quot;. To me, &quot;open&quot;
means &quot;you've bought a copy, it comes with source, but copyright
applies&quot;.

Back to Jose, who said anything about a EULA? If Prashant is happy to
make Studio &quot;open&quot;, would you be happy?

Cheers,
Wol

Hi Prashant,

The last thing I want is to bother anybody.
I just feel many of you miss the key point. I's not about whether
anybody can 
download it at no extra cost. It's not about commercial vs free.
I personally find uninteresting if you develop ANTLR Studio aiming to
make 
money or not. It's your decision, which doesn't affect me but my wallet
(I 
probably should be more used to pay regardless of the license). That is
what 
*commercial* means. However, it's good you have found a motivation to
develop 
a tool to help the ANTLR community.

However, if I get your software, having paid for it or not, and I notice
that 
I don't have access to the source code, and that you force me to accept
a 
EULA which restricts almost everything I can do with your software, then
some 
people would have no option but to reject it. That is what *free* means.

There's no need to accept unacceptable rules, even though we're used to.
The 
author gets an illussion of &quot;protection&quot; by legally restricting and 
physically difficulting other uses of his software.

If you make it commercial, and *free*, then I would keep an eye open on
your 
IDE, and even offer you my help eventually. If you make it commercial
but 
*not free*, then, for me, ANTLR Studio doesn't exist.

One last thing, please don't get confused by Copyright and licenses.
Nobody 
has the right to claim himself as the author of ANTLR Studio. You write
it, 
you are the Copyright owner.

Greetings,

Ahh, that's the difference.  In this case I'm working with a tree
grammar which doesn't behave the same.

&gt;<i> In the case where all you're doing is testing the reference against null,
</I>&gt;<i> it may seem as though it wouldn't matter whether it corresponds to a
</I>&gt;<i> single token or more than one token. But ANTLR doesn't analyse
</I>&gt;<i> expressions in the target language, so it can't special-case this
</I>&gt;<i> situation.
</I>
True, and this even holds for comments in the target language, which
bit me once.

&gt;<i> This restriction tripped me up as well when I first came across it.
</I>&gt;<i> Arguably, it would have been better to *always* require an attribute
</I>&gt;<i> access -- say, &quot;$labelName.token&quot; in cases where you want a Token, and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;$labelName.isPresent&quot; to test whether labelName matched any tokens
</I>&gt;<i> (or characters in the case of a lexer grammar).
</I>&gt;<i> That would have been easier to remember, and more consistent between
</I>&gt;<i> different kinds of grammar. Currently lexer grammars are not even self-
</I>&gt;<i> consistent: depending on context a bare $labelName reference evaluates
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes to an integer code point value, and sometimes to a Token
</I>&gt;<i> object reference.
</I>
I'll have to remember that.

&gt;<i> [The other thing I think is suboptimal about ANTLR's behaviour in this
</I>&gt;<i> area (at least the Java target; I haven't checked other targets) is
</I>&gt;<i> that it generates a variable in the target language that has the same
</I>&gt;<i> name as the label. This means that leaving off the '$' will result in
</I>&gt;<i> code that may compile, and if it does compile, usually does something
</I>&gt;<i> unintended. It also causes errors if a label name matches a target
</I>&gt;<i> language keyword. Just mangling the name slightly would have prevented
</I>&gt;<i> these problems, although doing so now might be incompatible with any
</I>&gt;<i> grammars that rely on this property of the generated code.]
</I>
Thanks for the great explanation and details.

To a degree. You can't specialize std::basic_string for char or wchar_t, 
because those already exist (and are typedef'd as std::string and 
std::wstring, respectively). You can, of course, write your own class 
(or class template) with an API just like std::basic_string.

Ruslan, so far you've provided no evidence that std::string is the 
problem. That's not to suggest that it's not; but I don't think you'll 
get much traction for such a change without reproducible data.

(And that is without raising the issue of whose std::string we're 
talking about.)

&gt;<i> 	And then the problem is right back again: if ANTLR used
</I>&gt;<i> 	std::string internally (or any string) and it converts to char*
</I>&gt;<i> 	and if you use some string class, your object (&quot;str&quot; above) has
</I>&gt;<i> 	to construct itself -- performance hit.  Now if ANTLR returned
</I>&gt;<i> 	std::string by reference and you did the assigment above, it's a
</I>&gt;<i> 	simple pointer copy.
</I>
The typical std::string implementation is unlikely to be ideal from an 
efficiency perspective. That's not its role; its role is to be adequate. 
The performance characteristics required of a string class are 
sufficiently application specific that &quot;one size fits most&quot; is probably 
the best the C++ standard library will ever provide.

There's no question that ANTLR could provide a better one. The only 
question is whether std::string tends to be enough of a performance 
bottleneck to make it worth the effort.

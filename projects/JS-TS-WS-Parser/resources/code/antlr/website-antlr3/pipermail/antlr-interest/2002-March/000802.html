No such luck--that will have to wait for 3.0.  Basically, I added a 
few classes to support &quot;tree actions&quot; and about 30 lines of code in 
JavaCodeGenerator to interpret the actions.  

&gt;<i> The changes need porting to C++ still I presume?
</I>
Yes--something like 50 LOC in CppCodeGenerator, and then another 500 
LOC for the translocation support library--I have jUnit test code 
which covers that code, so the translation to C++ might be done 
quickly.

&gt;<i> &gt; My current code base is based on 2.7.1; Ter and I plan to upgrade 
</I>to a 
&gt;<i> &gt; 2.7.2 base before releasing 2.8.

</I>&gt;<i> This means we are going to jump from 2.7.2a1 to 2.8 ?
</I>
More likely at least a 2.7.2b release will precede 2.8.0a--I have to 
jump through a few hoops to release my code (and I may not be able to 
release through the jGuru site--stay tuned) and that will take a 
little time.


&gt;<i> Well done!
</I>
Thanks!  This is about the first third of what it takes to 
dramatically speed up ANTLR development--the second third is Ter's 
code generation support, and the third component would be a 
refactoring browser/interactive grammar analyzer tool.  I'd dearly 
like to see something like that done for 3.0.

&gt;<i> Is there already a branch available in the repository with these 
</I>changes?

No--I have to work through intellectual property issues with JPL/NASA 
before I can formally release the code in some fashion.

<PRE>Hi there,

I'm currently using the Java.g parser grammar (by Yang Jiang) from 
<A HREF="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/compiler-grammar/">http://openjdk.java.net/projects/compiler-grammar/</A> and am trying to add 
tree construction rewrite rules and operators to build an AST. That's 
quite a job in itself (I'm trying roughly to base it on one I found in 
the mercurial repository on that site that contained actions that 
created a javac-style AST).

Anyway, my specific question relates to the LAST ALTERNATIVE in the 
following rule (from the &quot;expression hierarchy&quot;):

unaryExpressionNotPlusMinus
     :   TILDE unaryExpression -&gt; ^(BITWISE_COMPLEMENT unaryExpression)
     |   BANG unaryExpression -&gt; ^(LOGICAL_COMPLEMENT unaryExpression)
     |   castExpression
     |   {inHandlerDeclaration||inRunMethodDeclaration}?=&gt; 
inSynchronizationExpression // only allowed within handler declarations 
(which in turn are inside component definitions)
     |   primary -&gt; primary
         (selector -&gt; selector[$unaryExpressionNotPlusMinus.tree])*
         (   PLUSPLUS -&gt; ^(POSTINC $unaryExpressionNotPlusMinus)
         |   SUBSUB -&gt; ^(POSTDEC $unaryExpressionNotPlusMinus)
         )?
     ;

The last alternative does look a little complicated but it is basically 
creating a single tree from the 'primary' in case nothing else is 
matched (due to the * and ? that mean we could not match anything), 
while the subsequent rewrite rules (-&gt;) within the alternative are 
successively building up the tree by making the tree constructed thus 
far a child of a newly created tree (this is done by referencing the 
rule itself -- referencing $unaryExpressionNotPlusMinus in the context 
of a rewrite rule means &quot;take the current value of the tree of 
unaryExpressionNotPlusMinus&quot;).

However, when I run the grammar through ANTLR (3.3) I get the following 
errors:

error(100): /JavaBTranslator/src/JavaBPhase1SynSem1.g:1026:19: syntax 
error: antlr: expecting RPAREN, found '-&gt;'
  |---&gt; (selector -&gt; selector[$unaryExpressionNotPlusMinus.tree])*

error(100): /JavaBTranslator/src/JavaBPhase1SynSem1.g:1027:22: syntax 
error: antlr: expecting RPAREN, found '-&gt;'
  |---&gt; (   PLUSPLUS -&gt; ^(POSTINC $unaryExpressionNotPlusMinus)

error(10):  internal error: /JavaBTranslator/src/JavaBPhase1SynSem1.g : 
java.lang.NullPointerException
3 errors


It seems that ANTLR does not like the -&gt; that appear in the middle of 
the alternative for some reason. The problem could be a simple ANTLR 
syntax thing which I'm not clear about.

Anyone have any ideas about why I'm getting these errors.

Thanks,
Stephen

PS. also, it seems that coming up with the tree grammar rules to 
recognise the tree might be a little harder than constructing the tree 
in the parser, at least for the more complicated tree rewrite rules like 
this. But I'll have to cross that bridge when I come to it.

</I>&gt;<i> YourFavouriteCustomAST. The support lib uses the dumb version for Tokens
</I>&gt;<i> and with a modern g++ it barfs pretty badly (there might have been a time

</I>&gt;<i> stuff seems to fail (or I missed something when I was looking at it, I did
</I>&gt;<i> not have much time then)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In general the reference counter that are used now give loads of trouble

&gt;<i> I'm not 100% sure but I think there's no smartpointer in C++ possible

</I>&gt;<i> some other implementations (Loki among them)) but I don't think they'll
</I>&gt;<i> solve the actual problem (that it's an object pretending to be a pointer)
</I>
If I may ask... What's the exact nature of the problem?
&lt;shameless-plug&gt; I'm an author of yet another smartpointer library, this one 
is different though, as it implements full GC instead of just reference 
counting. it's here: <A HREF="http://smieciuch.sf.net">http://smieciuch.sf.net</A> &lt;/shameless-plug&gt;

Maybe, as I played with such stuff, I could be of some help... Or if it's 
impossible to do as ANTLR needs it to be, I'd be also interested in knowing 
about the exact limitations.

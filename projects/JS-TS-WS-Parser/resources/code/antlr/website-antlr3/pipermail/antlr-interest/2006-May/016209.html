<PRE>This is really one of those situations where building a solution into ANTLR
is probably a mistake: simplicity is a virtue.  As a user, you can always do
something like

{ saveState(); } (synpred) =&gt; &lt;grammar fragment&gt;
|<i> { recover(); } &lt;alt fragment&gt;
</I>

if you ever encounter a situation where a rollback is really needed.  I've
never seen a case where that was true, although I have done the &quot;wouldn't it
be nice&quot; thinking.  Like everyone else, I sometimes try to provide solutions
to non-problems and regret it later.

Does anyone out there have an example that justifies the implementation
effort?  That would probably be good to know before Ter does the work.

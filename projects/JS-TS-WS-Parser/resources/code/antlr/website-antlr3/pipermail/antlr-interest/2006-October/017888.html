A parser doesn't *have* to create an AST. For example, consider a syntax
directed translation. That is something that simply recognizes token
structure and performs some actions.

I'm not sure how an AST a la antlr prevents you from doing this. 

&gt;<i> because it may certainly have changed since you last looked at it..in

</I>&gt;<i> may have changed, its argument types may have changed.
</I>
Changed from what to what? And how the heck can they change in a single
run of the compiler? I'm confused.

&gt;<i> Also, my tool does not have to be fast - if it takes an hour to 
</I>&gt;<i> translate some code, when it could
</I>&gt;<i> have taken 2 seconds if I had designed it &quot;right&quot;, that's ok.
</I>
I don't think anyone is telling you that you didn't design it right! I
myself would like to have the power of:

v1 = v1 + v2 =&gt; v1 += v2

transformations. Myself, I'm only trying to figure out what the big deal
is that prevents you from using antlr. Personally, I know I wouldn't
want to write token matching code.

Please don't think I am attacking your translator. We all know how
difficult the problem is you're trying to solve. All I'm trying to
understand is how you solved it.

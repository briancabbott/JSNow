<PRE>My AST contains the basic syntax of the language I am parsing.  I would 
like to augment that with some derived information.  For example, I have 
struct-like aggregates where each field knows its size, and I would like 
the overall aggregate to know its overall size (summed across all fields).

This derived information is very easy to express using &quot;returns&quot; 
attributes.  For example:

	aggregate returns [int size]
	  : '{' (field { $size += $field.size })+ '}'
	  -&gt; ... ;

	field returns [int size]
	  : ... { $size = ... }
	  -&gt; ... ;

However, these returned attributes seem too transient for my use.  The 
size of the aggregate will be visible to the rule that invoked the 
aggregate rule, but I need to keep this information around long after 
initial parsing is done.  In particular, I would like to refer to the 
aggregate's already-computed size in later tree grammar passes that emit 
string templates.  For example:

	tree grammar ... ;

	aggregate: ... -&gt; aggregate(size={????}, fields={$fields}) ;

I cannot find any way to access the computed size attribute in order to 
fill in that &quot;????&quot; spot.  It seems that the returned attributes are 
quite transient, no longer accessible once the initial parse is over.

I considered stashing the computed attribute values in the text of extra 
(imaginary) tokens, but that requires converting all such values to 
strings, which would be painful in many cases.  Where / how should I 
keep this extra information around?  Should I be creating my own 
CommonTree subclass with extra fields to store this stuff?  Or is there 
some more standard way of carrying this extra information around?

<PRE>Thanks for the help.

Does anyone know of any good tutorials on how to build an AST with c#?
When I get the top level tree, it's children are the individual
characters of the string I passed in.  I'm not quite sure what the
approach should be to get it to parse into an AST (Maybe my
understanding is wrong, but I'm trying to get a tree like what you see
in the antlrworks interpreter).

I've been trying to find some good examples for the latest version of
antlr, but none of the csharp samples I could find work.

something critical from my grammar?

You need to call the top-level rule in your parser.  Which in your case
appears to be 'qexprlist'.  So call qpar.qexprlist() and it'll either
return the tree directly or the tree will be one of the members of the
structure it returns.  (Things vary a little depending on target and
grammar structure, but it's not hard to work out.)

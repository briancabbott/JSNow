</I>
Aah, the physical sciences ;) Oddly enough, I remember that sentence...

&gt;&gt;<i> Often I wonder if people new to ANTLR even bother to check out the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;getting started&quot; page on the wiki. It's quite disturbing to me to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think they do not, because when I'm new to a tool I might start

</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I did not follow the guidelines very closely. I began

</I>&gt;<i> ordered The Book. I hope that Book &gt;= Wiki holds? If not, future  
</I>&gt;<i> editions should contain some stuff from there.
</I>
The book is a definite must-have, IMHO. However, many people  
complained about the lack of (free) documentation, but almost anything  
I was able to find either on the wiki or in the list archives.  
Granted, getting started with a new tool can be tough, but I think  
there's enough information out there to jump start people, even if  
they haven't got the book (yet).

&gt;&gt;<i> I just realize that probably the biggest source of confusion are  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> combined grammars. If a beginner does not grasp the important  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distinction between lexer and parser rules, it's probably best to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> start out with separate grammars for those. Then, all of a sudden,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> realization comes when you see that separation into two files. :)
</I>&gt;<i> I do not understand why combined gramars exist at all. If the only  
</I>&gt;<i> way to work with them properly is to separate parser and lexer rules  
</I>&gt;<i> completely, well, then it doesn't matter if I have one ore two files.
</I>
I'm lazy, thus I like to actually have them in one file so I can &quot;jump  
to definition&quot;. Other than that, I don't think there's any reason for  
it. Internally of course, they are two files :)

&gt;<i> Given, of course, that ANTLRWorks interprets and debugs as smoothly  
</I>&gt;<i> as with combined gramars with separated ones.
</I>

It does, though I think you need to use &quot;Debug Remote&quot; and write the  
main class yourself. Then again, if you are not working in Java,  
that's a moot point anyway.
I tend to use &quot;debug remote&quot; all the time, except for the most  
simplistic grammars, because in one way or another those grammars are  
tied to my applications.
Ok, that's not entirely correct: For the latest one, I modified the  
glue code template ANTLRWorks uses, to be able to provide a case  
insensitive character stream.

cheers,

<PRE>The first bug needs to be fixed.

The second issue is really that you should not need predicates in a tree
walker as you are in charge of the tree shape and should therefore produce
a tree that is completely free of ambiguities. I must have missed your
original question.

The third is not likely to be done to be honest - you might be better hand
coded that anyway.

Jim

&gt;<i> Kieran,

</I>&gt;<i> Which issues are these?
</I>
I was thinking of (in precedence order):

- Backtracking and labels (see
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2012-March/044216.html">http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2012-March/044216.html</A>).
I started working on this but got stuck, then got project diverted. All
the context is in the list thread and my code is at
<A HREF="https://github.com/kierans/antlr3">https://github.com/kierans/antlr3</A>

- Gated semantic predicates for C walkers
(<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2012-April/044387.html">http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2012-April/044387.html</A>).
  However this may not be a bug as my question about gated semantic
predicates in walkers throwing exceptions didn't get a reply (are GSP
treated differently in walkers to parsers?)

- The last issue I was thinking about was more a feature request which I
don't expect has been done due to time constraints and that's Tree Pattern
Matchers
(<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2012-August/045126.html">http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2012-August/045126.html</A>).

The first issue is a well known bug, the second may or may not be a bug,
and the third as mentioned is a feature because it's just missing due to
noone actually wanting it till now in the C target.

If anyone else who has worked on these issues has gotten them to work, it
would be nice to have the code in the 3.5 release.  If not, oh well.
  I'm not trying to bag Jim out here BTW, without his efforts for the C
target my project would be a bit stuffed as I think Antlr is the best of
breed tool, and I can't use Java as an implementation language. So I
personally really appreciate his efforts.


Cheers,

&gt;<i> I have &quot;fixed&quot; the couple of (release-phase) issues that have been
</I>&gt;<i> affecting my usage of the C target.

</I>&gt;<i> You can find my patches on GitHub:

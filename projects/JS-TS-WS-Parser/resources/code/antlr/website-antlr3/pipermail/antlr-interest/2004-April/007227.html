Nope. As Antlr's licence is 'weaker' (i.e. less restrictive) but GPL 
compatible, GPL trumps it in the resulting work. If it was stronger and GPL 
incompatible, then there would be no way to licence resulting code (i.e GPL 
would be unapplicable).
In such conflict situations many experts say it's possible to just release 
source code (as a case of free speech), and allow end users to build an 
applicaytion by themselves, but everyone agrees that any form of binary 
distributution (or even partly preprocessed code, like source files 
generated by Antlr) is then legally impossible.

&gt;<i> This gets into the simple (but most certainly NOT simplistic :-) issue of
</I>&gt;<i> the licensing of co-mingled code which mostly devolves to an issue of how

Exactly.

&gt;<i> The GPL's viral nature would infect the co-mingled, derivative work but
</I>&gt;<i> would have absolutely no effect upon the licensing of the individual parts.

It has no effect on the licencing on the Antlr code of course, but that's by 
itself pretty useless.

&gt;<i> If, as the example was asking, the licensing of the ANTLR code (runtime and
</I>&gt;<i> generated) had restrictions on co-mingled, derivative works then you could
</I>&gt;<i> NOT actually apply the GPL without violating such a license. 
</I>
Exactly.

&gt;<i> In the case
</I>&gt;<i> of reality, ANTLR's license is extremely permissive (i.e., currently public
</I>&gt;<i> domain which means that anybody can &quot;steal&quot; it and otherwise treat it as
</I>&gt;<i> their own) but eventually it will be a BSD-alike which would continue to
</I>&gt;<i> apply even if you created a co-mingled, derivative work.

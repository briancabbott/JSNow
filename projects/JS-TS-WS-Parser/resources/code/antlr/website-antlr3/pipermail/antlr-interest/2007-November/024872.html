<PRE>Thanks - honestly, that (and the bold example in the book) are everything I found about this issue.

I have been using ANTLR 2 now for years and years (I started with PCCTS ...), I have written very complex grammars in ANTLR 2 with &quot;jumping lexers&quot; (what now would be channels) parsing horrendous languages mixing fixed-column and free-text layout in the same file, I have lectured people about LL(k) and LR(k) parsing etc.; up to now I was quite happy with ANLTR 2 - but maybe I sinned and used too many features ;-)

ANTLR 3, with its LL(*) analysis and its even better performance, is something I long for (and we have changed over a few projects to it - especially complex ones) - but still, arbitrarily modifying the text of returned symbols - including fragments - is a feature I'd very much need ...

Maybe a trade-off can be made: If no ! is in a rule, then it is very fast; if ! are in there, the code creates a replacement object and hence gets only fast ;-). The surrounding (calling) rules would have to know this (but this is not a real problem, I'd say) so that they would correctly assemble their text ... ...  but probably I'm just re-discussing what you already discussed.

Still ... (right now, it takes 9 minutes to parse the dozen or so million lines I have to parse - with ANTLR 3 this could well be 2 minutes, I reckon).

Regards &amp; thx
Harald

 and I managed

</I>&gt;<i> The ! operator is pretty ugly to implement when all you have is

</I>&gt;<i> It is possible, but there are workarounds for most of the cases where  
</I>&gt;<i> you might want it. If everything else fails, it is possible to  
</I>&gt;<i> implement (and I think the ! is properly lexed and parsed by ANTLR).  
</I>&gt;<i> So in theory you could write it yourself ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IIRC Ter was against implementing it for ANTLR v3 because it is hard  
</I>&gt;<i> to get it right *and* efficient.

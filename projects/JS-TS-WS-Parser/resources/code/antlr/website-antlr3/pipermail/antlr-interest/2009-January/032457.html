Yes, this is fixed (or should be) in the current source code snapshot. 
Perhaps it isn't and that is why the other poster was creating so many 
tree nodes. That's why I wanted to seen an example. Changing dupTree 
isn't the answer it is higher of the chain where dupTree should not be 
being called. Perhaps I never checked in the fix. I am making some time 
this week for this and other runtime investigation..

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> after passing a piece of non-trivial source code through the parser of
</I>&gt;<i> the language we created, memory consumption went through the roof (it
</I>&gt;<i> immediately consumed the full 3GB of memory on my 64 bit Ubuntu box) and
</I>&gt;<i> this for a source file of a measly 14K characters. Using a debugger and
</I>&gt;<i> a profiler I immediately came to the same conclusion as this poster:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://preview.tinyurl.com/a94qgn.">http://preview.tinyurl.com/a94qgn.</A> Recursive invocation of rewrite rules
</I>&gt;<i> results in addChild() and dupTree() being invoked millions of times.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While his example was slightly contrived, because of the problem domain
</I>&gt;<i> our language is highly recursive in nature. And although the source file
</I>&gt;<i> was slightly bigger than a toy sample, it is by no means what we intend
</I>&gt;<i> to use it for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, desperately wanting to get to the bottom of this I used Jim Idle's
</I>&gt;<i> response to the aforementioned post (emphasis mine):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;quote&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> That looks like a bug - in fact, I think I remember saying to myself 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;now I have put in factories for everything, I should *not call dup on 
</I>&gt;<i> the trees*! However, I also remember doing that, so perhaps it is 
</I>&gt;<i> something to do with your grammar) Sorry, but I still won't be able to 
</I>&gt;<i> look in to this until the weekend :-( 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/quote&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> to determine that I could maybe short-circuit the code in dupTree() in
</I>&gt;<i> 'antlr3basetree.c'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's what I did:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> static void    *
</I>&gt;<i> dupTree		(pANTLR3_BASE_TREE tree)
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>   /* Fixes memory explosion when using rewrite rules */
</I>&gt;<i>   return tree; 
</I>&gt;<i>   /* Rest of code removed */
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> in other words, instead of duplicating the tree, I just return it. This
</I>&gt;<i> seems to solve the problem. Memory consumption is back to normal and the
</I>&gt;<i> code seems to run OK.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The questions that I have are these:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Is this workaround valid or are there some unforeseen bodies still
</I>&gt;<i> left in the closet?
</I>&gt;<i> 2) If this is a bug, as was indicated in the response to the OP, will it
</I>&gt;<i> get fixed in one of the following released of ANTLR?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the input,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sven

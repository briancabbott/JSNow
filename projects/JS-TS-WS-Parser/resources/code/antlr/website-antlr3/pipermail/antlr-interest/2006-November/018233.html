Operator overloading makes just as much sense in Java as it does for C, 
C++, and FORTRAN: any application that uses
matrixes will be crying out for it, and all those languages are used for 
such applications. The reason Java doesn't
support operator overloading (in my view) is a pragmatic one: Gosling 
chose to leave it out because it's more often
misused than used correctly. Regardless of how powerful the rope, if 
it's more often used to hang yourself than
to tie things up, it's not a good tool.

</I>
I don't think Java's lack of pointers has much to do with security. Yes, 
it's harder (maybe impossible) to provide security
with pointer support. But I suspect Gosling's thinking was more along 
the lines of &quot;I just hate the bugginess of code that
uses pointers.&quot; Just my guess.

</I>
Again, only in the sense that Java is a &quot;crippleware&quot; version of C++: 
it's a separate language, and no C++ programmers were
harmed in the making of Java :)

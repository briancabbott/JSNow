<PRE>The exchange below from the pccts newsgroup properly belongs here...

I'd just like to add that the technique Kunle describes applies to 
Java as well. 

Not sure about how it can be done with C++ in the general case, Ric?. 
Monty?

Cheers,

Micheal

For C#, you could investigate dymamic assemblies - assemblies that 
you create at run time. Then you could:
1. Load your grammar file (note your grammar files must obviously be 
error free)
2. Execute ANTLR to generate C# source
3. Create an assembly dynamically that contains your Lexer/Parser (or 
better still architect your system to use a single pre-generated 
Lexer)
4. Load the assembly into your AppDomain and use the parser as usual

Some issues:
1. To be able to access the functionality in dynamic assemblies, your 
types should (must?) implement interfaces that your system is already 
aware of. For Lexers, ANTLR already has TokenStream etc. You will 
need to provide similar for Parsers and TreeParsers and use 
the &quot;classHeaderSuffix&quot;  option in your grammar files to ensure your 
Parsers/TreeParsers implements them.
2. Your interface above must define a common entry point for 
validation (and your grammars must implement the entry point) or you 
will need to use reflection to invoke arbitary entry points.

Anyways, I guess you've got the idea...

Good luck,

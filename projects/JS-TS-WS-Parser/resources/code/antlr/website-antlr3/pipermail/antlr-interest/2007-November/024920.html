synpreds are not &quot;simply sempreds in disguise&quot;; that is a &quot;feature&quot; of the current implementation.  They are actually a lookahead device, and may be implemented (more) efficiently in some future version of ANTLR.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> foo:
</I>&gt;<i>   (bar) =&gt; bar
</I>&gt;<i> | (dar) =&gt; dar
</I>&gt;<i> | (lar) =&gt; lar
</I>&gt;<i> | (rar) =&gt; rar
</I>&gt;<i> ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When all I really want to say is: &quot;match the first expression that
</I>&gt;<i> fits, and for god's sake don't give me any warnings about it!&quot;
</I>
The usual behavior is &quot;match the expression that fits&quot;; adding &quot;first&quot; imposes order.  Synpreds impose that ordering.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There also seems not to be an easy way to say &quot;in this context, don't
</I>&gt;<i> try matching X, it won't work and you'll get stuck&quot;. Or for that
</I>&gt;<i> matter a way of incorporating previously matched tokens: &quot;If you have
</I>&gt;<i> matched A and B, and the next token is D, then now would be a good
</I>&gt;<i> time to match a C.&quot;
</I>
I suspect that this comment is lexer-specific, as is Gavin's comment about needing synpreds in places where they should not be needed.  This is on Ter's &quot;to be fixed&quot; list, and actually has to do with the use (or non-use, as happens now) of FOLLOW sets in lexers.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Both semantic and syntactic predicates seem like very powerful tools,
</I>&gt;<i> but they seem a bit immature at the moment, and just need a bit more
</I>&gt;<i> bedding down.
</I>
There is some truth to this, if you change the &quot;they&quot; to &quot;the current implementation&quot; in the &quot;seem a bit immature&quot; description.  Both PCCTS and ANTLR 2 provide strong bases of experience with predicates.  ANTLR 3 uses a different analysis approach (LL*), which is sufficiently powerful that Ter originally thought he could dispense with synpreds until experience showed otherwise.

The best way to get past this is to report use cases which &quot;should&quot; work but do not; that helps provide fodder for testing.

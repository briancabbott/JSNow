&gt;<i> I've been anxiously been awaiting subversion, but I cannot risk our code

While subversion may eventually get to the point where it's safe to use for
production, I'm not holding my breath for it.

The open-source SCM system that I'm most interested in is OpenCM.org.  It's
being headed up by Jonathan Shapiro of the EROS capability-based operating
system fame.  Alas, development is moving slowly given their workload.

&gt;<i> We currently use CVS and it hasn't let me down yet.  But, having a free
</I>&gt;<i> version control system with intelligent, atomic merging would be a big
</I>&gt;<i> step forward!
</I>
FWIW, Perforce makes their server available for free to anyone.  The only
limitation being that it will only support two users and two clients.
I used that for years for my own, personal development work at home.

Take care,
	John

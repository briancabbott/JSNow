<PRE>With these discussions about ANTLR 3.0 popping up occasionally, I wanted
to throw out an idea that has been bouncing around in my head.  The
thing is, I'm not really a compiler developer so I don't know whether
people would generally consider this a good thing to do, but it seems
like it would work out well for me.

To accommodate my mental model of how data should be handled during the
compilation process (and that is admittedly probably pretty warped), it
seems like there would be some benefit to using the DOM API from XML as
the basis for tree construction.  First off, you have a standard API
that people are familiar with and is, after all, used to build and
traverse trees already.  Another more subtle advantage of the DOM
approach would be to take advantage of some of the &quot;richness&quot; in the
trees.  The fact that the DOM spec. includes the concepts of attributes
and elements (not to mention text and comments) seems like it could
enhance the way we thing about tree construction.  For example, I find
the idea of distinguishing attributes and elements quite appealing
because in most cases it seems like the information in the AST really
falls into two categories: information about a node (attributes) and
information about the structure contained by the node (elements).  It
has always seemed confusing to me that the ANTLR tree construction
doesn't account for these separately.

All that being said, there is nothing that prevents users of ANTLR from
instantiating a DOM and operating on it during tree construction.  I was
just thinking it might be nice if the tree construction rules could
automatically do this.  I can imagine a situation where the parser could
be written in C++ and instantiate a DOM structure that could then be
accessed after the parsing from Python (assuming there were Python
bindings to the DOM C++ API).  Perhaps some degree of target language
neutrality could be achieved through this approach as well?

Anyway, this was just a thought.  I'm probably going to try and play
around with it because I'm working on a project where the &quot;compiler&quot;
process is going to be distributed across several tools and we're going
to try and use XML as an intermediate representation between passes.
For such an approach, using a DOM API to build the tree is ideal because
when we are all done we can dump XML to a file for the next tool to pick
it up and run with it.

Any comments?

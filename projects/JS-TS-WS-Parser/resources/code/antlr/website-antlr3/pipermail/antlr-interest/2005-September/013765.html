</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that is true, but it also says that you gotta distribute the

</I>
Well, I sold a GPLed tool for 12k $ recently. The customer had a problem, it 
fixes it, and now the customer is willing to pay for more features.

&gt;<i> That said some parts of ANTLR Studio do come under the Sun Public
</I>&gt;<i> License and source will be provided with them. Specifically the
</I>&gt;<i> AntlrStudio.Lexer_1.0.0.jar distributed with the beta is under SPL.
</I>&gt;<i> You can download the source even now from netbeans site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.) Why dont i give the IDE for free and charge for services? Doesnt
</I>&gt;<i> redhat use the same business model?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a difference between providing support for an IDE and
</I>&gt;<i> providing it for and Operating System.
</I>&gt;<i> Also AS has from the begining been designed such that you can
</I>&gt;<i> instantly start using it ful fledged without reading any manuals or
</I>&gt;<i> requiring any support. If you watch the videos you will see it says -
</I>&gt;<i> Time to learn ANTLR Studio - 0 minutes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if you have used Eclipse before you should get started with using
</I>&gt;<i> AS right away. There is nothing new to learn. No new keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> shortcuts, etc. You dont need to modify your code for use with the
</I>&gt;<i> debugger. Hell, you dont even need to press Ctrl+Space to auto
</I>&gt;<i> complete!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the people who have got the beta version have been able to use
</I>&gt;<i> without requiring any help from me ( aside from the bugs they
</I>&gt;<i> encountered).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.) Somebody said something like giving the software away with GPL
</I>&gt;<i> allows the small guy to gain advantage in the market.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will correct you on this. Yes, it does so, but only when the the
</I>&gt;<i> small guy is competing in a *large* market. The market for language
</I>&gt;<i> tools is small, very small and i wont be surpised if ANTLR Studio soon
</I>&gt;<i> becomes the leaading tool in the market.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4.) Some guys are saying that ANTLR should have been GPLed so that all
</I>&gt;<i> tools for it would be GPL and that i am *selling* the work of Terence!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This really is the craziest message i have got. NO, I am NOT selling
</I>&gt;<i> Terence's work! ANTLR is still free and can be downloaded free of cost
</I>&gt;<i> from antlr.org. ANTLR Studio has been designed from the ground up by
</I>&gt;<i> me and me alone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason why ANTLR is not GPL is cause then every program that uses
</I>&gt;<i> it would need to be GPLed and Terence certainly doesnt want that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had a talk with Terence regarding ANTLR Studio going commercial and
</I>&gt;<i> he told me that he was perfectly fine with it.
</I>
This seems to be *pragmatic* vs *moral*. Some recent post said that the only 
thing that matters is the &quot;usefulness&quot; of the software. Maybe that is too 
ambitious. I find that point of view respectful, but weak. In some sense, I'm 
also pragmatic. I use only Free software because it provides me the warranty 
that I will never regret: everything I learn, whatever customizations I do, 
will help me improving the way I use the tool. Non-free software doesn't 
allow me to improve my skills but using their rules: papers and keyboard 
shortcuts, at most.
I once used a tool called Together. I should had used Emacs since the 
beginning, despite all the features Together had. Me as a professional cannot 
afford going back and forward.

But anyway, if GPL makes it more difficult to make money, do you think 
&quot;closing&quot; it will give you better results? I wish you luck, but it's not 
about the GPL: you just don't care enough about the &quot;4 freedoms&quot; of ANTLR 
Studio customers. You just discard thinking about that *moral* stuff unless 
you got your monetary compensation. I hope you'd reconsider it should you get 
rich ;).

<PRE>One thing that will help is to share token types using the import mechanism.
We have the Parser produce a token file, and the TreeParsers use that token
*.txt file as their token set.  To audit, use diff of the Parser's *.txt file
with each TreeParser's *.txt file.

Another thing is a light-weight tree audit pass (one rule, one lookup table);
We implemented tree audit passes with a rule and a lookup table:

   node : #(op:. { audit(op-&gt;getType(), op-&gt;numKids()); } ( node )* );

The audit() method looks up a node type in a table, and verifies that the
number of kids is correct.  It can also report if there's a node that is not in
the table of NodeType-&gt;#kids map.

We also use more precise audit passes that define the contract between passes
by detecting correctly formed trees:

   noMoreKids[AST root] : ( . { report failure here; } )? ;

   expr : #(op:EXPRESSION value noMoreKids[#op]);
   value : add | sub | mult | div | .... ;
   add : #(op: ADD value value noMoreKids[#op] );
   sub : #(op: SUB value value noMoreKids[#op] );
   mult : #(op: MULT value value noMoreKids[#op] );
   div : #(op: DIV value value noMoreKids[#op] );
   // etc

Hope this helps,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am working on a compiler that started as a multi-person project. We decided
</I>&gt;<i> to separate the different compiler stages in different grammars: A lexer
</I>&gt;<i> generates tokens, a parser constructs an AST, which all the following stages

</I>&gt;<i> think this is the standard way to do it with AntLR.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I just detected that the compiler fails to reject a lot of incorrect
</I>&gt;<i> programs! This happens because the parser sometimes generates AST nodes that
</I>&gt;<i> the TreeWalker grammar just silently ignores ... First I thought that there
</I>&gt;<i> is something wrong with AntLR or with my error-handling code. But then I
</I>&gt;<i> reread the documentation, and there it is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;An important thing to remember when specifying tree patterns and tree
</I>&gt;<i> grammars in general is that sufficient matches are done not exact matches. As
</I>&gt;<i> long as the tree satistfies the pattern, a match is reported, regardless of
</I>&gt;<i> how much is left unparsed.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This can be very annoying! If there is an inconsistency between the Parser
</I>&gt;<i> and the TreeWalker grammar, there is very little chance to detect it.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, unknown nodes are sometimes silently ignored. Is there a way to turn
</I>&gt;<i> off this feature? How do you ensure that the TreeWalker grammars really
</I>&gt;<i> correspond to the AST generated by the parser?

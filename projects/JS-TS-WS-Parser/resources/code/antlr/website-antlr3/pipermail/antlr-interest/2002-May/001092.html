Fortunately for me I care only about named classes ;)  Man do I hate 
this inner class crap...really made Java complicated just because we 
can't have function pointers...ick.  Add generics and we're right back 
to C++ (well, nothing can be that complicated) ;)

</I>
Ah...i wondered if anybody would actually do that.  That is good.  Now, 
can they do two-level indexing so I can find all nested classes?  I know 
it can do it by asking about the parent for context, but can it do it 
via the index so it is fast?

I would totally agree.  When I used to build a lot of translators, 
having a simple inline capability with a method call to find subtrees 
within a tree was very useful even for just printing stuff out.

<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt;I view Java's decision to do a &quot;limited implementation&quot; by avoiding
</I>things 
&gt;<i> &gt;like multiple inheritance as exactly what made it successful. By avoiding
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt;being &quot;completely pure&quot;, Java is accessible to average programmers. And 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;that's why Java is popular and Smalltalk and LISP are not. It's also why 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;people prefer Java over C++.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Having seen systems implemented that rely heavily on multiple inheritance,
</I>&gt;<i> I would make the observation that it is fraught with difficulty.
</I>
So is single inheritance in the wrong hands.

&gt;<i> I view 
</I>&gt;<i> the move towards interface inheritance instead as a positive development 
</I>&gt;<i> that has facilitated the widespread use of component based programming.
</I>
Interface inheritance predated VB/Java/C#. C++ had it before for instance.
It's proper use simply needed to be taught to &quot;average&quot; programmers.

&gt;<i> Component based programming is where the real life promise of OO has 
</I>&gt;<i> finally been realized, IMO. It is interesting that the two languages most 
</I>&gt;<i> widely used in real life component based systems have been VB and Java 
</I>&gt;<i> (and now C#).
</I>
Not that surprising since the archetypal CBD developer is an &quot;average&quot;
developer consuming components written by others (usually developed in C++
for VB'ers to consume).

Java/C# fare better as tools used by component producers. Nevertheless, the
most flexible/performant components are still developed in C++.

&gt;<i> It doesn't say much for the language purist approach.
</I>
This isn't a religious debate (I hope). ;-)

&gt;<i> I think that one of the reasons that Java took off is that it gave you 
</I>&gt;<i> automatic storage management and runtime type checking &quot;out of the box&quot;.
</I>
As did many other systems before it. Having a big company (or a few if one
includes Netscape, IBM et al) aggressively pushing it probably had a much
greater impact.

&gt;<i> In C++, you have to &quot;roll your own&quot; storage management. Having come from 
</I>&gt;<i> LISP machines in the early eighties, C++ seemed like huge step backwards 
</I>&gt;<i> for this reason. It also didn't help that the linker model was primitive 
</I>&gt;<i> and reuse involved the use of shared header files. This made it difficult 
</I>&gt;<i> to deliver components from one company or group to another.
</I>
Yet C++ was the de facto tool for component producers during the period when
VB finally delivered on CBD's reuse promise.

&gt;<i> The lack of multiple inheritance, in comparison, was a tiny tiny issue.
</I>
For some people/projects, yes. Not so for others.

&gt;<i> I suppose this is a bit off-topic.
</I>

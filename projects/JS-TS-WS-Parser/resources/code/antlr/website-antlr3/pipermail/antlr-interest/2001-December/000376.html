That's what I thought at first until I realized that the gates are 
always being executed while the wasted ast creation is only done while 
&quot;guessing&quot;, which by design is done infrequently.  Somehow, removing the 
gates wins over the infrequent but expensive memory allocation.  
Probably depends a lot on the garbage collector's efficiency at 
reallocating objects of a common.

Very true.  But that makes sense I'd say.  We could make it a rule :)

&gt;<i> trees might be more inclined to do table adds in their initialize(),
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps?  I suppose that the guessing state could be passed to the
</I>&gt;<i> initializer....or for that matter to the factory which could then just

</I>
Sure...ASTFactory.create() could also just ask the parser (have to add a 
ref to the parser in there though).  That would be like executing all of 
the gates again though.

&gt;<i> I like that better.  astFactory.create() returns nullAST if currently

</I>
Hm...probably not.

&gt;<i> optimizer cache inputState.guessing==0 for those tests?  Probably 
</I>&gt;<i> not--can't
</I>
maybe not across method calls.

&gt;<i> guarantee another thread won't muck with it.  The generated code could 
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> a boolean in the method, updated only upon entry to the method and on

</I>
I'm thinking we can get away with saying that creation of nodes (even 
hetero nodes) must be side effect free.

<PRE>Are you wanting to put these changes in 2.7.3 or writing a completely new
tool (AspectAntlr)?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is grammar subclassing still appropriate?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it should be a function of the environment.  I.e, have a library

</I>&gt;<i> grab to begin a new grammar.  A live push-forward-changes sort of thing
</I>&gt;<i> is the same as inheritance ;) (I think they call that RCS) ;) ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When I think about grammars and aspects I think actions--AspectANTLR
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be the tool to weave your actions into your pure antlr grammars.  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trick
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oooooooohhhhhh.  Now THAT is the perfect explanation of what an Aspect
</I>&gt;<i> is.  You don't want to modify a grammar physically just to add actions
</I>&gt;<i> into the right spot!.  Oohhhh.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is how to specify the join points and the answer is???  Note that your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IDE
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could still let you edit the actions as if they were attached to the .g
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; file, but in reality they don't have to be.  Nice for multipass tree
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transforms and mixing C++ and Java output languages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh man...i think we're on to something.  AspectANTLR :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I like the separation of antlr phases concept.  When I was digging into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lookahead to generate a lookahead dependency graph I was frustrated by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; caching of lookahead info.  I don't remember exactly now but it seems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maybe I was trying to find the specific rules contributing to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ambiguity
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but sometimes when I got to the ambiguous rule the lookahead was already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; computed without the backlinks to what rules contributed to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lookahead
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; set.  Because you don't just want to know that a rule is ambiguous.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 50% of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the time it's because another rule called it and I was automating that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manual process of figuring out which caller rules were to blame.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, the cached lookahead information is useless for determining the
</I>&gt;<i> paths in the grammar that are nondeterministic.  I would really like to
</I>&gt;<i> have ANTLREclipse or whatever be able to highlight the paths for you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The caching is absolutely necessary for efficiency of this algorithm.
</I>&gt;<i> Without it I cannot claim it is O(nk) where n is size of grammar.  But,
</I>&gt;<i> a new version of antlr could avoid the caching when finding the problem
</I>&gt;<i> spots.

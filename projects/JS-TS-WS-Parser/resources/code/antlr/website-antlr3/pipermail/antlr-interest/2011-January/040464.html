</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [antlr-interest] Multiple-target parsers, and extending
</I>&gt;<i> without overriding
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi-
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm new to ANTLR, and I'm trying to evaluate its suitability for a
</I>&gt;<i> project I'm working on. I'd appreciate help with a few questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - What is the status of C++ support? The wiki indicates that C++
</I>&gt;<i> support is coming &quot;later in 2008&quot;, but this is obviously out of date.
</I>

Compile the C output as C++, keep custom code and actions entirely out of
the parser and produce AST outputs.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - One goal of the project is to provide cross-platform parsing and
</I>&gt;<i> unparsing support, i.e. to generate parsers and unparsers in multiple
</I>&gt;<i> target languages (primarily C++ and Java) from a single representation
</I>&gt;<i> of the grammar. As far as I can see, the only way to accomplish this in
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR is to provide a grammar with AST output type which uses only
</I>&gt;<i> rewrite rules and AST operators (and, for unparsing, a tree grammar
</I>&gt;<i> with template output type), with no target-language code at all.
</I>
Actually I use source code control for this. Start with a base definition
of all your grammars without any actions, then branch to specific targets
and add any target specific code.

&gt;<i> However, I'm not sure this is feasible; many ANTLR features (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> attributes and predicates, custom error handling) and techniques (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> implementing case insensitivity or keywords-as-identifiers) require use
</I>&gt;<i> of a specific target language. Is this approach workable? Are there
</I>&gt;<i> better options I'm overlooking?
</I>
You keep all such code outside the grammar and within your application
code. There are few differences if you do that. Also use:

id: ID | KEYWORD1 | KEYWORD2 ... etc;

And not comparison code on ID to workout keywords.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Another goal of the project is to provide a unified parsing framework
</I>&gt;<i> for a family of closely related but distinct languages (specifically,
</I>&gt;<i> SQL dialects).
</I>
You and everyone remotely interested in SQL ;)

&gt;<i> We want to be able to express the language grammars in
</I>&gt;<i> terms of an inheritance hierarchy, where each language (other than the
</I>&gt;<i> base) is specified in terms of its differences from the parent
</I>&gt;<i> language. This seems like a natural fit for ANTLR's support for
</I>&gt;<i> composite grammars, but I see two drawbacks with that approach: first,
</I>
SQL dialects are not really compatible enough to do that.

&gt;<i> the languages may differ in both lexical structure and syntax; since
</I>&gt;<i> combined grammars cannot inherit from other combined grammars, this
</I>&gt;<i> seems to imply that we'd need to maintain separate, parallel
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchies of lexer and parser grammars, which are combined only in
</I>&gt;<i> the leaves. Is there a cleaner solution? Second, the composition
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism doesn't seem to support extending a grammar with new
</I>&gt;<i> productions; only overriding existing productions.
</I>

Yes. Source code control is a better option here. Especially if you use
one that is good at branches such as perforce.

Jim

</I>Hi Alexey,
Yea, I guess I shouldn't mentioned TreeDL. Thanks for correcting that - 
I'll take it out.
As you can see, I was just trying to list a few technologies relating to 
tree-transformation.

As for the rest of your comments, I just have one place where I'm very 
sceptical:

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2a. It is source of code generation. You need not write depth-first
</I>&gt;<i> walker by hands and update it on each AST change - just re-generate it.
</I>
I'm not sure exactly what you're claiming here. You're not saying that, 
for example,
I could change ANTLR to produce a different AST structure for Java code 
input,
and have whatever AST-processing I've written still work correctly, are you?

I mean, if the AST structure changes, whatever code is written that does 
something
with that AST (whether just print it, change it, or whatever) is now broken.

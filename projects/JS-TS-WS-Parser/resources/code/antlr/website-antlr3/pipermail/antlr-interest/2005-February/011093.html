</I>
Yeah, an imperfect but acceptable solution.

&gt;<i> Re:  -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Definitely better than =&gt;.
</I>
Yep.

&gt;<i> Re:  Tree rewrites
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (A) Getting rid of the e.g., #(...) is good by me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (B) I'm concerned by the need to repeat the arguments in the RHS such 
</I>&gt;<i> as in:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> decl : &quot;var&quot; (ID ':' type ';')+ -&gt; ^(&quot;var&quot; ^(':' ID type)+) ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What happens when there's two &quot;var&quot;s?  Which &quot;var&quot; is going to be used 
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> the basis on the RHS?
</I>
it depends on how many times it's matched on the left.  If matched once 
then only one &quot;var&quot; node will appear in the rewrite.

&gt;<i> Heck, what about typos?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [Yes, I understand that they can be explicitly labeled -- I'm asking 
</I>&gt;<i> about
</I>&gt;<i> these &quot;simple&quot; cases.]
</I>
Typos will always be a problem if you ref something improperly.  if 
it's a nonexistent entity, i can give an error.

&gt;<i> Re: Imaginary Nodes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I find the LPAREN[] utterly distasteful and expect that it will cause 
</I>&gt;<i> hard
</I>&gt;<i> to see errors.
</I>
Yeah, it's not so great, but it is like a ctor call with no args right? 
  We'll need ID[&quot;foo&quot;] for example to create an ID node with a text 
value of &quot;foo&quot;.

&gt;<i> Re: Actions in rewrite rules
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You need to expand/clarify that section in your document.
</I>
Thanks...

&gt;<i> Re: Rewrite specs in subrules
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, I don't buy either of your arguments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it's more clear and controllable to (finally) support 
</I>&gt;<i> labelling the
</I>&gt;<i> subrules.  The subrule rewrites are then constrained to be bound to the
</I>&gt;<i> label which is used in the overall rewrite rule for the rule.
</I>
I could buy that.  Labeled subrules should be easy enough to implement 
and *should* solve lots of problems.  Then we'd not need -&gt; in 
subrules, right?  Well, wait, hmm...not sure we can use syntax to drive 
different tree construction easily.  I suppose if you could label a 
subrule and then ref label.ID for the ID tokens matched within labeled 
subrule.  Hmm... interesting.

&gt;<i> Re: Attribute integration
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I've noted previously, I don't like the co-mingling of the dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> attributes and the local attributes.  I think it's important that those
</I>&gt;<i> separate but related constructions appear distinct from each other.
</I>
Can you be more specific?  We may have differing ideas of what those 
terms mean ;)

&gt;<i> Re: Rewrite dependent on semantics
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (A) I like the use of semantic predicates for this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (B) Is it just me or is the ? at the end of the semantic predicates
</I>&gt;<i> ridiculously hard to see?  I'd love to see that move to be a prefix, 
</I>&gt;<i> i.e.,:
</I>&gt;<i>   ?{...}
</I>&gt;<i> The left edge is (with any non-insane formatting convention) always 
</I>&gt;<i> easier
</I>&gt;<i> for humans to scan and parse.
</I>
True, but that argues for *(...) and +(...) too :)

&gt;<i> Re: Other Issues that I didn't see addressed in your blog...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (A) Payload games
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm... Don't we need to support the ability to treat the payload as 
</I>&gt;<i> e.g., a
</I>&gt;<i> list of payloads?  I.e., I'd like the first payload in the AST node to 
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> the e.g., Token but then I want to add annotations that are tied to 
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> node (rather than building e.g., a map).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (B) Tree to tree transformations basics
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basic question: is anything that you're thinking of doing going to 
</I>&gt;<i> make it
</I>&gt;<i> (a) easier, clearer, etc. or (b) more confusing, harder, etc. in the
</I>&gt;<i> multiple tree-to-tree phases?
</I>
I'm still thinking about that, but tree-&gt;tree transformations should 
look the same as parser-&gt;tree construction.

&gt;<i> (C) Tree surgery
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Moving beyond the simplistic cases in (A), all of the interesting work
</I>&gt;<i> being done in tree tranforms is real surgery of the tree.  I.e.,
</I>&gt;<i> transformations which take place across a number of rules working in
</I>&gt;<i> conjunction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A couple of areas that come immediately to mind are the need for 
</I>&gt;<i> labelled
</I>&gt;<i> subrules and being able to pass (and use) trees (aka tree fragments) 
</I>&gt;<i> around
</I>&gt;<i> in dynamic attributes (both down/inherited and up/synthesized) and as
</I>&gt;<i> parameters/return values.
</I>
Yes, I want to be able to reference tree fragments via attribute 
mechanism.

&gt;<i> (D) Error handling
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You haven't gone into how the error handling would work with this.
</I>
Yeah, I need a few examples to think this through.

Thanks!

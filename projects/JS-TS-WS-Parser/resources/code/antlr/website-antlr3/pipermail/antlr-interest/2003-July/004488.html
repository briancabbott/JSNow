I will break that patch out separately anyway the synchronization stuff in 
collections.impl is only a warning.  It still compiles.

Stripped is 1.64mb

Yes, shipping pccts is not real good.

Be careful wanting linux distributions to ship your software - its a double 
edged sword.  Half the time they end up distributing an ancient version of 
your software usually with their own custom patches which break all sorts 
of things.  Of course *you* end up having to support this as 99% of people 
who use the linux distribution refuse to pay for it and thus get no support 
from the vendor.   ;-)

I have tried it with my BASIC compiler and everything has worked so 
far...got a couple of deprecation warnings on compiling which were easily 
fixed(setASTNodeType-&gt;setASTNodeClass).

Surely 10e6 people have sent you ant scripts for antlr by now....maybe just 
copy one of them in and put the authors email address at the top to handle 
all the problems and complaints.

The problem with ant alternatives is for java projects that have to work 
across windows/unix is how unportable they are.  Make and Gmake exec 
processes for so much of their functionality ie 'find', 'grep', 'touch' 
which are a real pain to get working reliably across platforms.  Using 
shell scripts and batch files means maintaining at least 2 versions which 
always seem to get out of sync.

I have heard the people in the java world that don't like ant are often 
using the javamake tool from a  shell script or 
something(<A HREF="http://www.experimentalstuff.com/Technologies/JavaMake/">http://www.experimentalstuff.com/Technologies/JavaMake/</A>)

As well as build process how are you going to package antlr?  At the moment 
there is a 'antlr.jar' for runtime and need to include the antlr home 
directory in the classpath to run the tool. Alot of people seem to rebuild 
antlr.jar to include everything.

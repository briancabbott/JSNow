&gt;<i> I will have all the archives up in mailmain shortly so we should in  
</I>&gt;<i> better shape... 
</I> 
1) Hi, please can someone tell me - how gmane and yahoo-groups 
are working together ? 
I quite don't understand that, because gmane clearly 
is not able to feed itself with yahoo-groups. 
 
2) If I post to that <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">antlr-interest at yahoogroups.com</A>, will it arive 
into gmane ?  
You all seem to post to some &lt;&lt;antlr-interest-hHKSG33TihhbjbujkaE4pw  
at public dot gmane dot org&gt;&gt;, but this address is not mentioned 
anywhere ( on antlr site ). Or does yahoo .forward those messages 
to gmane ?? Please can you tell me ? 
 
 
3) You do not need to spider gmane ( gmane has export ),  
If you just wanna TRY it - go with 2190/2199. 
<A HREF="http://download.gmane.org/gmane.comp.parsers.antlr-interest/1/2199">http://download.gmane.org/gmane.comp.parsers.antlr-interest/1/2199</A> 
it's not tgz, its long plain mbox. 
 
4) but you need to spider yahoo ( I don't know currently hope I'm 
wrong ). 
But gmane seem to have lot less messages then yahoo.  
You seem to switch somewhen at Jun-2004 ?? 
 
5) like to know, what are you going to do switch at now ? 
   to that groups-beta.google.com 
I don't say google is bad ( didn't try it ), I just like to know. 
 
Cheers,          Suk

<PRE>There is an old C/C++ parser which I have been updating and
maintaining available on the antlr website.
 
However, I use it to generate lexer and parser in C++ using ANTLR 2.7.
It could of course produce a parser in Java but I think you would then
need to convert quite a lot of support code from C++ to Java before it
would all work. I don't think that would be too difficult.
 
If you are interested in doing this let me know as I have a more up to
date version (3.2) which I am still working on.

Hi

I am looking for C C++ grammar that would generate the parser code in
java.
Any information on this is welcome.

Thanks
Smitha

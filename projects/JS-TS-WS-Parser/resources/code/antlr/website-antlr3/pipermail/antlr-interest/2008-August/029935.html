<PRE>Hi!

I guess all you need to prevent that kind of thing is some static  
information about target language, right?

I specify my target language in gramar header. I ANTLR would have a  
file per target installed to look up some stuff (like line comment  
indicator, of course) once per code generation, it could sort this out  
at runtime. Would be a generic solution, also, for target developers  
could update the information file as they like, ANTLR would look it up.

I don't know how target developing goes. Perhaps each target could  
take care of this on its own entirely.

Regards

Raphael

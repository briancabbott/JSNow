It appears it's not backtracking because only 1 extra char is enough,  
but it cannot be statically determined if we assume any char can  
follow.  I think you could make the subrule more complicated and it  
would require 2 extra then 3 then 4 etc...

&gt;<i> This is because the clause ('.' DIGIT+)? must either match a dot

</I>&gt;<i> right.
</I>
Isn't right in that it won't do what is natural.  I couldnt' make  
antlr do the right thing easily in this case.

&gt;<i> Similarly, if the construct was ('0' 'x' DIGIT+)? then it must  
</I>&gt;<i> check a minimum of three characters before matching the clause as a  
</I>&gt;<i> whole.  For ('.' DIGIT*)?, the minimum is only one character.
</I>
Yep.  Now make that 'x'+ and you have arbitrary lookahead.  Now make  
it a rule+ ref and you have non-regular arbitrary lookahead etc...

&gt;<i> For ('.' DIGIT+ FOO)?, it must have unbounded lookahead
</I>
ha!  you're ahead of me. yep.

&gt;<i> -- it must verify that there really is a FOO after all the DIGITs  
</I>&gt;<i> before it can accept the clause.  This is the tricky case, but it  
</I>&gt;<i> is the case that was supposed to be dealt with automatically by  
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR with the switch to LL(*) [as I understood it].
</I>
The issue is that there is an implied (ANYTOKEN)* and really wildcard  
following any rule.  I can look at it again sometime, but i am unsure  
how to make antlr see farther into the fog of &quot;there are infinite  
unspecified char next&quot;.

&gt;<i> &gt;correct by how LL lexers (unlike lex lexers) work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But LL(*) is supposed to look ahead as many characters as it needs  
</I>&gt;<i> to in order to determine that it really is a match, isn't it?   
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise this is a step backwards from v2, where you could at  
</I>&gt;<i> least define an LL(k) lookahead limit greater than 1.
</I>
yep, but the fog after a lexer rule defeats it.

&gt;<i> &gt;Remember folks: you can't just list a bunch of lexer rules that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;make sense to a human and expect ANTLR to &quot;make it so&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why not?  This case seems fairly straightforward.
</I>
Not to me and I spent 4 years making LL(*) work. ;)

&gt;<i> Any time there's an optional block (whether ? or *), ANTLR should  
</I>&gt;<i> use sufficient lookahead (where &quot;sufficient&quot; might mean  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;unbounded&quot;, as in the example above)
</I>
Can you tell me how to compute the static LL lookahead?  If not, then  
trust that I know it's not possible or at least too much for my  
brain. ;)  It's the fog that causes the problem for LL(*).  I could  
backtrack automatically upon error like lex but it would be VERY slow  
in a recursive descent lexer.

Have you built a lex like creature before?  I have back in 1988.  I  
believe I'm remembering how it operates correctly.

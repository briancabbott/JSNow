Perhaps the answer is to extract the java code generator and replace 
it with a flexible set of extensibility interfaces. Hey Terrence?

All the code generators can then be rewritten against those 
interfaces. As a bonus, adding additional languages would be made 
considerably easier.

I would be happy to finish this if you are happy to pass on all that 
has been done so far. Any docs would be appreciated.

&gt;<i> I'd also like to start a discussion on making this process easier.

Is this in reference to generating parsers for multiple langues on 
the .NET platform or, in relation to ANTLR's code generation process. 
It might be useful in the latter as I suggested above.

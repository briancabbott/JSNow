98% of ANTXR is ANTLR. An ANTXR grammar is essentially a superset of an
ANTLR grammar.

&gt;<i> Yes, I see that. But you're not addressing the question I asked: Why

</I>
With ANTXR existing, I would say noone should write an ANTLR grammar for
XML ;)

Grammar-based XML parsing (whether ANTLR or ANTXR) can be very effective
for some XML parsing tasks. If you're just reading something from XML into
a pretty-direct object structure, then it's not a good solution (and some
of the tools you've pointed out are better suited.)

If the structure you want to read into doesn't match the xml structure, or
if you want to &quot;execute&quot; the xml, or if you don't plan to store all of the
data, a grammar-based solution can be much easier to maintain.

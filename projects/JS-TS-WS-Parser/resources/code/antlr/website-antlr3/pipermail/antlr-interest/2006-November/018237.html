</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At some point an array of booleans (boolean[]) in Java actually used

</I>
The place to look would be the JVM spec, which has only this footnote:
In Sun's JDK releases 1.0 and 1.1, and the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, 
v1.2, |boolean| arrays in the Java programming language are encoded as 
Java virtual machine |byte| arrays, using 8 bits per |boolean| element.

So that sounds like you're outta luck for now, but the spec doesn't rule 
out a change in the future.
Sorry, I didn't mean to get your hopes up :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (2) Maybe swerve the conversation to more tangible topics :-)
</I>
Not likely :) As with older languages, better to let older threads that 
have gone off track
just fade away quietly :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I should probably ask in comp.lang.java or some such, but how many  
</I>&gt;<i> times does this thing come up in a passing conversation? I just  
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't resist.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,

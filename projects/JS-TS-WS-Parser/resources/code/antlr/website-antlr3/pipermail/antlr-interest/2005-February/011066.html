<PRE>Hi all,

I have a tree parser which checks the AST generated by my parser for
type safety. I would like to define some exceptions of my own to display
type errors. For example, &quot;TypeMismatchException&quot; or
&quot;InvocationException&quot; or &quot;IncompatibleOperandsException&quot; and so on..

I am trying to throw these exceptions and handle them in the class that
contains the main() method which invokes the compiler so that I can
return errors to an app that passes source code to the compiler. 

The problem is I am forced to add the &quot;throws&quot; clause to each and every
rule in my tree walker for each exception. My tree walker has around
1000 rules and almost 50% of the rules are capable of throwing more than
one of the exceptions I mentioned above. I tried to add exceptions as
they are thrown in a list and return it to the calling program; However,
If I do this, I am unable to stop the compiler execution when an
exception is thrown. If I extend java.lang.RuntimeException to write my
Exception classes, I don't have to add the &quot;throws&quot; clause but it seems
to be a bad idea to mess with RuntimeExceptions in catch blocks.

Any ideas?

RIC: THANKS FOR YOUR ADVICE, I AM ABLE TO INITIALIZE MY LEXER/PARSER
JUST ONCE AND PASS DIFFERENT PIECES OF CODE BY JUST RESETTING STATES!

Thanks,

B.

The symbol_information is a copy-paste error from the original code
the rest should be ok. The other method signatures should be present,
or maybe a small difference with the original antlr would be possible
since I use custom constructors inside that project. But basically a
look at the header files should make things clear?

Cheers,

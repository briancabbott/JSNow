I still don't see why you would want that.  That would just make 
the job of figuring out what it all means much harder.

 &gt;I should describe more of what I'm doing.  I'm creating a parser 

 &gt;that parses a &quot;language&quot; and then provides the ability to 
display the
 &gt;information in a form-based view for editing.  I will then let 
the
[...]
 &gt;In addition, the command name and keyword values have implied
 &gt;abbreviations.  So if you have 2 keywords - before and after, 
then
 &gt;b and a are sufficient to discriminate between them.

All of this stuff is best handled in the parser -- just create 
simple tokens eg. WORD, NUMBER, QUOTED_STRING, OPEN_BRACKET, etc, 
and work out what they actually mean at the parser level.

 &gt;Finally there is the concept of continuation - a statement can 
be
 &gt;continued by the last character on a line being a + or -.  The - 
is
 &gt;used when whitespace at the beginning of the subsequent line is
 &gt;significant; + just ignores any whitespace at the beginning of 
the
 &gt;subsequent line.

This one you should handle in the lexer; you can swallow up the 
intervening EOL and whitespace to hide it from the parser that 
way, so it just sees a single continuous statement.

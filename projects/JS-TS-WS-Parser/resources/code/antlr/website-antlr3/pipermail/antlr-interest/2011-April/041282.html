<PRE>I used a hand-crafted implementation of TokenSource between the lexer and
parser. In the preprocessor, whenever I manipulated a token I used a new
token class derived from CommonToken (call it SubstitutedToken) which
contained a linked list leading from the effective position in the stream
(stored in CommonToken) all the way back to the original location (file and
position) of the token definition. When a CommonToken substitution occurs,
the linked list has one node containing the original source position where
defined. Whenever a SubstitutedToken substitution occurs, a new node for the
token's previous effective position is added to the linked list and that new
head pointer is stored in the new token.

`define x 3
`define y `x
`y

In this case, token `y is eventually replaced with a SubstitutedToken which
appears at (line 2, column 1, length 1, text &quot;3&quot;) containing the following
linked list:

Line 3, column 1, length 2 (list head, the location where `y was substituted
with `x)
Line 2, column 11, length 2 (the location where `x was substituted with '3')
Line 1, column 11, length 1 (the actual source location where the token '3'
is defined)

This list allows true relative ordering of all tokens in the processed
source: when two tokens appear to be at the same location in the
preprocessed stream, you simply compare the positions of the first node in
the position list.

Hi Martin,

  I just completed an SV preprocessor which can parse UVM 1.0 successfully.
After 2 revisions I settled on a completely separate preprocessor(lexer and
parser). As you saw, you need to tokenize the macro_text in order to easily
support macros with arguments and detect the three escaped tokens `&quot;, `\`&quot;
and ``. I'm not sure how well a lexer only approach could handle cases where
a macro substitution can merge text with a previously lexed token. The
separate approach still has flaws, such as good error reporting. Of course I
could be missing an obvious easy solution.

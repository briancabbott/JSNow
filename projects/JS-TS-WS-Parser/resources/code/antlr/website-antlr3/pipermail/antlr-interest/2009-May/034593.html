<PRE>Sam,
Have you looked at Incremental lexing?  I think it provides very good
performance and used by a number of IDEs.  A great reference on incremental
lexing is this paper:

<A HREF="http://harmonia.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/twagner-lexing.pdf">http://harmonia.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/twagner-lexing.pdf</A>

To reduce memory you can use flyweight tokens (one token instance shared by
all token streams) for token types whose length does not vary.  You can use
this for keywords, common white-space patterns such as a single-space, etc.
 The trade-off is that you have to compute the start/stop indexes for tokens
based on a nearby non-flyweight token and the known-length of the flyweight.
 Generally, not a problem since syntax highlighting finds a start token
given a line number and walks forward in token order, so you can keep a
running count.

When using incremental lexing with syntax highlighting, you generally only
have to re-lex from the point of the edit to the token containing the last
visible character on screen, so there is not a large cost even if editing at
the beginning of the file.  As the user scrolls the document, you continue
lexing from the last token.

It is pretty straight-forward to modify the ANTLR runtime to use these
techniques.

&gt;<i>  As I mentioned once in the past, I&#8217;ve been working on improving lexer

</I>&gt;<i> Lexer/CommonToken is not required. A key example is syntax highlighters
</I>&gt;<i> which have strict performance requirements and must be updated as a person
</I>&gt;<i> types. I&#8217;ll start with a basic description of Visual Studio&#8217;s syntax
</I>&gt;<i> highlighting mechanism and the information a lexer must provide it. Then
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;ll describe some pathological use cases that should be avoided regardless
</I>&gt;<i> of the lexer used, as the algorithms involved have more of an impact than
</I>&gt;<i> simply improving the lexer&#8217;s per-line processing speed. Finally, I&#8217;ll
</I>&gt;<i> describe the &#8220;SlimLexer&#8221; and how one could potentially use it to gain an
</I>&gt;<i> additional performance edge after the other issues are addressed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1         Syntax Highlighting in Visual Studio
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The syntax highlighter for a programming language in Visual Studio is
</I>&gt;<i> called a *colorizer*, and is one item provided by a *language service*.
</I>&gt;<i> Visual Studio&#8217;s syntax highlighting API uses a per-line scanning mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i> The IDE itself directly stores (caches) a few pieces of information, where a
</I>&gt;<i> few additional items can be easily derived from them. The Visual Studio SDK
</I>&gt;<i> provides a wrapper for the core API that is somewhat more friendly when
</I>&gt;<i> using a tokenizing lexer for syntax highlighting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.1       Items internally cached by Visual Studio IDE
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Visual Studio maintains an &#8220;attribute cache&#8221; describing the color of each
</I>&gt;<i> character on the lines currently on the screen. Naturally, as the user
</I>&gt;<i> scroll the window vertically, this cache is continually updated. The
</I>&gt;<i> information describing a character&#8217;s attributes is stored as a 32-bit
</I>&gt;<i> integer. The customizable elements are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#183;         The color, stored as an index (range 0-255 inclusive) to a
</I>&gt;<i> customizable lookup table of colors available for use in the document.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#183;         A Boolean value of whether or not to show a line after the
</I>&gt;<i> current line. If you&#8217;ve used Visual Basic in Visual Studio, this is the
</I>&gt;<i> horizontal line that follows each procedure. It is a full-width underlining,
</I>&gt;<i> similar to the &lt;hr /&gt; HTML element, only with tighter spacing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#183;         A Boolean value of whether the character is part of code or part
</I>&gt;<i> of &#8220;human-language text&#8221; (a comment). This affects how the IDE handles
</I>&gt;<i> word-select mode, and improper use is the elusive source of some miserable
</I>&gt;<i> bugs. VSPhp actually suffers from this problem and it&#8217;s quite irritating.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The IDE also maintains a &#8220;colorizer state&#8221; per line of text. The state is a
</I>&gt;<i> 32-bit value exclusively reserved for the language service. The intent here
</I>&gt;<i> is the colorizer state allows a lexer to parse any line of text in the file
</I>&gt;<i> in isolation, without requiring any lookahead/behind to other lines. A
</I>&gt;<i> simple example of this is in multiline (block) comments. If a multiline
</I>&gt;<i> comment reaches the end of line X without closing, then the colorizer state
</I>&gt;<i> can include a flag that tells line X+1 to start the line inside a multiline
</I>&gt;<i> comment. Even though line X+1 doesn&#8217;t contain the opening token of the
</I>&gt;<i> comment (say /*), it can properly color the line without ever looking back
</I>&gt;<i> to line X.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Definition: Line X has a *valid cache state* iff line X was colorized *
</I>&gt;<i> after* the last time its cached state value was *changed*.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Definition: The colorizer *state at the start of line X is valid* iff the
</I>&gt;<i> colorizer state at the end of all lines 0-(X-1) is valid AND line X has a
</I>&gt;<i> valid cache state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Definition: The colorizer *state at the end of line X is valid* iff the
</I>&gt;<i> colorizer state at the beginning of line X is valid AND the text on line X
</I>&gt;<i> has not changed since the end state was last computed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is the process for colorizing line X:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.       If the colorizer state at the end of line X-1 is not valid,
</I>&gt;<i> colorize line X-1 to make it valid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.       Provide the state at the start of line X, plus the text on the
</I>&gt;<i> line X to the language service&#8217;s colorizer. The colorizer&#8217;s result includes
</I>&gt;<i> the state at the end of line X.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.       If the new state at the end of line X is different from the
</I>&gt;<i> cached value for the state at the beginning of line X+1, mark line X+1 as
</I>&gt;<i> having an *invalid colorizer state*, and store the new state in place of
</I>&gt;<i> the old.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.2       Additional items the user can easily compute
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The syntax highlighter can take advantage of the user state update
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism to effectively track the state per character on the line (or per
</I>&gt;<i> token), as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> StateAtPosition( line, column ) = StateAtEndOfLine( StartState(line),
</I>&gt;<i> TextOnLine(line).Substring(0,column) )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.3       How the SDK exposes these features
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Visual Studio SDK offers a Colorizer class and an IScanner interface to
</I>&gt;<i> simplify the creation of syntax highlighters. Since lexers generally operate
</I>&gt;<i> on tokens as opposed to individual characters, there is a disconnect between
</I>&gt;<i> what people are used to and what Visual Studio&#8217;s cache stores. These
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces allow the language service to provide information about the
</I>&gt;<i> tokens on a line, which it then internally breaks into characters and passes
</I>&gt;<i> the information to Visual Studio. Some additional things to note about using
</I>&gt;<i> this wrapper:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#183;         The wrapper does not expose (at all) the Boolean value for the
</I>&gt;<i> underline following a line.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#183;         The wrapper hides the Boolean value for whether a line is
</I>&gt;<i> human-language text, but the method is generally successful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#183;         The wrapper exposes the ability to set the background color
</I>&gt;<i> following the end of a line, but only via an undocumented/sneaky technique
</I>&gt;<i> that you&#8217;d only see if you saw the wrapper&#8217;s source code and knew about the
</I>&gt;<i> underlying interfaces.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#183;         The wrapper takes advantage of the mechanism in section 1.2 to
</I>&gt;<i> provide an additional 32-bit user-defined value per token. I personally use
</I>&gt;<i> this to keep track of ANTLR&#8217;s token type, but there aren&#8217;t any real
</I>&gt;<i> requirements since the value is never used by Visual Studio or its SDK.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2         High Performance Syntax Highlighting
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A high performance syntax highlighter must avoid cascading updates where
</I>&gt;<i> possible. A cascading update is incurred when a change in the document&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> text causes the state at multiple lines after the altered line to change.
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes this is unavoidable; for example, adding a /* to a line in C++ can
</I>&gt;<i> cause multiple lines afterwards to become comment lines instead of code
</I>&gt;<i> lines, all of which must be updated. Other times, this is avoidable. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, storing the line number in the state forces the state for all lines
</I>&gt;<i> after line X to be updated when a new line is added immediately following
</I>&gt;<i> line X. If the line number itself does not change the color of characters on
</I>&gt;<i> the line, then the line number should not be part of the colorizer state for
</I>&gt;<i> performance reasons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For a document with M lines and a maximum line width of W, this makes an
</I>&gt;<i> algorithmic difference of O(M) instead of O(1). You might only test your
</I>&gt;<i> colorizer with short test documents, but are your users programming in
</I>&gt;<i> documents with 10,000 or more lines? I know some generated ANTLR code files
</I>&gt;<i> in my language services are well in excess of 30,000 lines, and some
</I>&gt;<i> UnrealScript files I&#8217;ve seen have nearly 20,000 lines (my most complete
</I>&gt;<i> language service to date is for UnrealScript).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even some of my own language services suffer from this problem; be aware
</I>&gt;<i> that it can be difficult to redesign your language service after you start
</I>&gt;<i> using the colorizer state for other purposes (like line numbers), so make
</I>&gt;<i> sure your state design is correct from the start. This is one of many areas
</I>&gt;<i> where I&#8217;ve formed new/improved ideas but haven&#8217;t been able to incorporate
</I>&gt;<i> them in my largest language service due to the intricate relationships
</I>&gt;<i> between various IntelliSense features.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3         High Performance Lexing
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;ve observed that the Lexer/CommonToken features are overkill for certain
</I>&gt;<i> applications, including syntax highlighting. The simplest example is
</I>&gt;<i> single-line syntax highlighters have no need to store the line number as
</I>&gt;<i> part of the token. In order to reduce memory usage and improve speed for
</I>&gt;<i> this type of application, I&#8217;ve created a SlimLexer and SlimToken for testing
</I>&gt;<i> purposes. These currently have the following features:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#183;         The SlimToken is a C# struct, which is a stack-allocated value
</I>&gt;<i> type that is passed to methods and returned by value. As long as you don&#8217;t
</I>&gt;<i> force boxing by casting it to Object, it never requires heap allocation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#183;         The SlimToken is precisely 64-bits to allow efficient
</I>&gt;<i> pass-by-value in registers. As used in my testing, it stores:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> o   Token type (16 bits)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> o   Token channel (16 bits)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> o   Start index (16 bits)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> o   Stop index (16 bits)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#183;         The SlimLexer&#8217;s tokens are strongly typed to SlimToken to
</I>&gt;<i> eliminate the need to box values.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#183;         The SlimLexer&#8217;s most frequently called methods are non-virtual,
</I>&gt;<i> allowing the runtime to easily inline its small methods.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For applications that only need this information (or even a subset of
</I>&gt;<i> that), SlimLexer/SlimToken appears to operate about 6 times faster than
</I>&gt;<i> Lexer/CommonToken in about 1/4 the memory. I&#8217;m currently evaluating the
</I>&gt;<i> following items:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.       Is this layout of SlimToken the best choice? I certainly believe
</I>&gt;<i> 64-bits is the optimal width for a high-performance pass-by-value token.
</I>&gt;<i> However, if SlimToken only applies to a subset X of potential lexer
</I>&gt;<i> applications Y, then I want to make X as large as possible so more people
</I>&gt;<i> can benefit from its significant performance improvement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.       Do SlimLexer/SlimToken have a place in the ANTLR runtime, or are
</I>&gt;<i> they more suited to separate distribution?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.       What are the possibilities, if any, for a SlimParser?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a.       Could a SlimParser take advantage of an unboxed SlimToken?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> b.      Could a SlimParser have some unboxed output?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> c.       In my experience, syntax highlighters don&#8217;t need a parser, and
</I>&gt;<i> the parsers I&#8217;ve used need more complete token information than SlimToken is
</I>&gt;<i> able to provide. Is this a general view?
</I>&gt;<i>

Actually, alt 2 is the exit branch for a single alt (...)* loop so  
it's essentially saying it won't ever exit upon '+'. :)

&gt;<i> On a related note, any idea why antlr complains with &quot;2:16: The

For one, ANTLR must complain that there is no rule obviously followed  
by EOF.  In this case, though, I think it's saying that there is no  
input that will predict bypassing the (...)?, which of course there  
isn't due to lack of start rule.  It should become ('+' a) in the  
output and probably never terminate. :)

hooray for ANTLR v3's analysis engine. :) ;)

Oh, yeah. I know about it.

Funny story: A few years back, I had a disk crash wipe out months worth 
of work (yeah, yeah, what kind of programmer doesn't do back-ups&#8212;this 
kind, apparently) and when I reimplemented all the work I'd lost back 
to the most recent back-up, the result was distinctly superior. The 
whole project was largely experimental, and I could use what I'd 
learned the first time around to make the second attempt better.


&gt;<i> ...

I believe in progress. The new is often better than what it replaces. 
Not always, but then, not all engineers are good ones.


&gt;<i> That said, it's the best IDE I've ever used. :)  that's why i like
</I>&gt;<i> it.  I put up with quirks to get the right functionality.
</I>
You mean IDEA? I'd have to agree. But then, of all the many I've tried, 
it's the only one worth using at all!

Damn! I missed that opportunity to moan ;) Seriously, that discussion  
somehow escaped me. strange.
So, if you use those extensions already, for the next beta release  
I'll pick them up, too. Unless of course we want to use creator codes  
and resource forks and leave non-Mac users out in the cold :P

yup, they are as good as any.

&gt;<i> I don't support T.g3t -&gt; T.java in general as it is not orthogonal.  
</I>&gt;<i> But, whatever ;-)

Yeah, sorta. It has bugged me to have the TreeParser suffix, but  
after all it's just a name, so I don't care too deeply. Nice to have  
a system to it, I agree.

Still, I'm against forcing the extensions onto users. We can advise  
and tell people that some tools won't be able to work properly if  
they ignore the advice, but force? No need.
ANTLR could generate .g3l lexers for combined grammars to find its  
own file, but other than that it shouldn't care. This is a  
documentation issue, IMHO.

cheers,

<PRE>Hi Ivan,

As part of an experiment several years ago, I created a project where the
basic interface of all primary classes was specified in an intermediate
language. I used a tool to generate the C++ header files for one particular
reason: I wanted the headers to prefer forward declarations to #include
statements absolutely wherever possible. The result was one of the fastest
compiling (reasonably large) C++ projects I've ever worked on - we're
talking approach plain C speed. I wouldn't ever expect a developer to be
able to maintain the accuracy of this separation manually.

To handle inline functions which are normally placed in the header, if one
or more functions was marked inline in the intermediate language then the
declaration in the header was marked inline and it emitted a line like this
at the end of the header:

#include &quot;HeaderName.inl&quot;

The generated code had a number of other features not normally possible in
hand-written code:

1. The classes had the construction semantics of languages like C# and Java

1a. The vtable was fully initialized for the derived class before user code
in the base constructor executed.

1b. All fields were initialized to default values when the class was
constructed (the intermediate language allowed overriding this value).

2. The classes supported constant-time (3 inline assembly instructions on
x86) class-to-class dynamic cast (we're talking instanceof here, not type
equality).

Hi,
I have to warn you, that generally your request is nonsense and no tool can
fulfill it.
1. header file is something like an interface, you usually design is before
the .cpp file 2. the header file and .cpp file both include other headers
and in most cases the header's headers are only subset on the .cpp ones.
This is fundamental problem.
You do not want mix &quot;interface&quot; dependencies with &quot;implementation&quot;  
dependencies.
3. You usually do not want all the implementation internals to be exported
the header.
The tool would have to support some kind of blacklisting.
4. It is very hard to guarantee that the generated headers are &quot;correct&quot; and
compileable.
For example imagine two classes cyclically dependent. Implementation of
class A depends on B.hpp and viceversa. The tool can simply generate headers
with the infinite inclusion recursion.
5. It is also not easy to order the content of the header file.  
Imagine that you have
some types declared via preprocessor macros.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I took a look a more detailed look at that and lzz. I prefer the   
</I>&gt;<i> approach of makeheaders - unfortunately it is old enough that it   
</I>&gt;<i> does not understand namespaces. Still, for a project that does not   
</I>&gt;<i> need namespaces, it might just work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I find it AMAZING that C/C++ programmers put up with the hassle of

<PRE>I just wanted to follow up back on the list to thank John and endorse the
grammar. This does successfully solve the problem I was encountering. I have
not yet had time to dig in deep enough to figure out why my grammar was
losing parts of the AST during back tracking and John's is not. I will reply
again if I figure that out.

I also wanted to make sure we got on the list that this grammar requires
ANTLR 3.1 beta. I have been able to use it in the bundled mac ANTLRWorks
version 1.2 beta (after changing to VMOptions in Info.plist to allow more
heap space...).

Thanks, John!

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem, though.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That is, I can't seem to modify the grammar so that it doesn't require
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; backtracking. With backtracking, however, critical (for my purposes) parts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the AST are missing. For example, the branches that should be generated

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; f.getName().length()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is incomplete. I can get either the f.getName() function call in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tree or the length() function call, but not both.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So far I have tried using rule scopes, global scopes, parameters, return
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; values, and standard rewrite rules. I'm really confused that this is so hard
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for me. Could anyone give me some guidance?

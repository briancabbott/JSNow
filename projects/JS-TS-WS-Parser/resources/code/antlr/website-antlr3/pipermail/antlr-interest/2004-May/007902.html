<PRE>Hi Rob.

Cracked it! It looks like the bit of code you quoted was lifted pretty
much from your grammar ... but I was correct in saying &quot;consume&quot; added
the consumed token to the text. And the reason I was seeing it was
because the label &quot;123&quot; matches the INT rule, not the IDENT rule. Your
get/set length code was never getting touched because of the &quot;start in
column 1&quot; guard rule I'd implemented.

Anyway, I've now modified my INT rule to add a colon if it's a label and
there's no colon, and I've taken out the get and set length lines in the
IDENT rule. That means all user-defined labels must, internally, end in
colons (so I'll have to fix GOTO and GOSUB to add them if the user
doesn't :-). And all my internally generated labels don't end in a colon
so I'm guaranteed separate namespaces :-)

So here's to GOTO, and then on to argument lists. And isn't there a
function that uses ';' instead of ',' somewhere? Yuck :-(

Anyway, what's wrong with COBOL (which I've never used?). It's far
better than spaghetti (if you're programming, that is), though not
better than pizzas in most peoples' minds, I expect :-) As I said, the
Pr1me rule is &quot;implement the good stuff, not the braindead stuff :-)

Cheers,
Wol

You did not show the whole rule, you must have done something further
down.

Perhaps insert a before and after print statement ie
         if (state == STATEMENT) {
                 if (LA(1) == ':' &amp;&amp; getColumn() == 1) {
                                 System.err.println(&quot;text = &quot; + text);
                                 int len=text.length();
                                 consume();
                                 text.setLength(len);
                                 System.err.println(&quot;text = &quot; + text);
                                 _ttype = LABEL;


&gt;<i>And reading the UniVerse manual on labels it says &quot;A statement label
</I>can
&gt;<i>be put either in front of a BASIC statement or on its own line. The
</I>&gt;<i>label must be first on the line - that is it cannot start with a
</I>space.&quot;
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I read that as that a label MUST start in column 1 of a line ...
</I>&gt;<i>(although I admit it is ambiguous).
</I>
Its up to you, if you want to reinvent cobol go right ahead...;-)

If you really want to use getColumn(), then you will need to subtract
off 
the matched token length

ie getColumn() - $getText.length() == 1

&gt;<i>If other MVBasics allow labels in the middle of a line, I don't care.
</I>&gt;<i>None of the ones I know permit it ... And I'm inclined to follow the
</I>&gt;<i>Pr1me engineering philosopy - if it don't make sense, leave it out.
</I>Like
&gt;<i>I intend to do with implicit formats! If someone else wants it bad
</I>&gt;<i>enough, they can add it themselves :-)
</I>
Labels at the beginning of any logical  line and the implicit format are

both supported in the grammar i linked previously.

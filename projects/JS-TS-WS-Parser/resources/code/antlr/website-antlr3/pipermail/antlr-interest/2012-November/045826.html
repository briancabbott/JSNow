<PRE>I don't want to rain on anyone's parade but maintaining an ANTLR
target is a LOT of work and mist people get
bored/dissatisfied/upset/married/divorced/etc and we end up with half
finished targets or ones that fall away - JavaScript, python, ruby,
C++ in v3 for instance.

OK, so this is Parrr (pun intended) fir the course and we want anyone
and everyone to have a go. However, I think that for v4, it would be
helpful to have something akin to a commissioning or approval process
such that people could see whether a target was an experiment vs
production quality.

It could be as simple as not including a target in a code release
unless it is known to be good and up to date. The other targets you
could download and use, but that in itself would tell you not to put
too much faith in it.

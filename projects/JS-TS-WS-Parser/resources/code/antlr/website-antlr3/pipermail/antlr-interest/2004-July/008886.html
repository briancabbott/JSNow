<PRE>I have an architectural question re: parser reusability.

I have a parser for Javascript / Actionscript and am deriving a couple 
of products from it -- a Javadoc-style compiler and a Eclipse editor 
plugin with &quot;lint&quot; functionality.

The parser generates a straightforward AST, and I've been using a tree 
parser on the result to recognize and rename ordinary function 
declarations into constructors and methods. However, when I want to do 
Javadoc, I may actually need to post-process with two tree parsers -- 
one to rewrite some of the nodes, the other to assemble the Javadoc 
output.

I've thought of a way to do this in one parser, but I don't want to 
modify the generic language parser as that kills reusability. So, I'm 
asking your advice: which of these would you do, given the choice:
1) Alter the base parser for each application
2) Subclass the base parser and roll the changes into the subclass
3) Go ahead with a generic parser and apply transforms to the resulting 
trees?

I'd appreciate hearing from the more experienced folks here :)

Thanks,

  ...Richard

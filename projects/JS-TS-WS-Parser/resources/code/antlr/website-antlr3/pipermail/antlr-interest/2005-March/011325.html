<PRE>I've been an antlr advocate since it was pccts (Hi Terence :) but I've
not really had occasion to use it much since then.

My boss stopped by today with a question that I'm relaying here as I'm
really not familiar enough with the mechanics to know if antlr
supports this mode of operation.

What he'd like is to be able to keep the specification clean and the
code separate. He mentioned Grammatica which uses the EBNF to produce
a parser, but you implement the actions by extending the class for
each leaf in the generated code.

Have I made myself clear? Is this something that antlr supports?
Pointers to where I can easily resolve this are as (if not more)
welcome as direct answers.

Thanks for any information.

My approach is different, since I want to use ANTLR to parse a
scripting/template DSL in web pages. There is no 1:1 translation possible,
since there's a lot of environment stuff involved.

ASTs can be cached, avoiding re-reading the file for each request. ASTs mean
that the language parsing engine is decoupled from the execution engine, so
I only need to rebuild the parser when the language itself changes rather
than for every bugfix. ASTs mean that I don't need to write a whole new
runtime for ANTLR in PHP.

Anyway, the biggest one is decoupling and separation-of-concerns. I just
don't think a grammar is a good place for executable code except where it is
specifically enables understanding (not execution) of the input.

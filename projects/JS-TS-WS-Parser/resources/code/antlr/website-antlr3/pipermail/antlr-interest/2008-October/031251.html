 &gt;Just my 2 cents, but shouldn't duplicate imports be supported at

If you think of grammar imports as class inheritance (which is 
what they behave most like), then I think you'll find that those 
other languages don't really support it all that well either :)

In C#, multiple inheritance of interfaces is supported cleanly, 
but interfaces carry no implementation.  Since the 
implementation-inheritance model is single-inheritance, there's no 
possibility of a serious clash.  I'm not sure about Java exactly, 
but I believe it's similar.

In C++, if you try to make class C inherit from both B1 and B2 
(where B2 inherits from B1), then it will indeed include an extra 
copy of B1 (in what's known as a &quot;deadly diamond&quot;), unless B1 is a 
virtual base class.  This seems like the same behaviour as what 
ANTLR exhibits, except that (currently at least) ANTLR provides no 
means to make it a virtual base :)

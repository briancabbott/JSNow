<PRE>Hi folks,

I've finally upgraded my little interpreter from Antlr 3.1 to Antlr
3.3, but I'm getting different behavior in the treewalkers than I did
before and I'm not quite sure what to make of it. Specifically, I have
a rule for parsing if statements in my grammar. It's nothing fancy,
but here is a snippet:

IF condition = root_expression if_then = THEN
{
//do some processing on the expressions
process_this( $condition.eval.getType(), $condition.step);
}

What's odd, however, is that in  antlr 3.3, the values I pass into the
condition in my returns statement seem to be null under conditions
that I have not been able to ascertain. For example, in the &quot;Object&quot;
class in my language, I have the following method:

action Compare(Object object) returns CompareResult
        CompareResult result
        integer myHash = this:GetHashCode()
        integer oHash = object:GetHashCode()

        if(myHash &lt; oHash) then
            result:result = result:SMALLER
        end else if myHash = oHash then
            result:result = result:EQUAL
        end else then
            result:result = result:LARGER
        end
        return result
    end

And Antlr fails when it tries to process if(myHash &lt; oHash) then in
the tree walker. However, if I take basically the same code and place
it into another method (e.g., or call it from somewhere, adjust it,
really anything I've thought of), for example:

action Main
        CompareResult result
        integer myHash = this:GetHashCode()
        integer oHash = this:GetHashCode()
        if myHash &lt; oHash then
        end
    end

The exact same comparison does not fail. So far as I can tell, both
work correctly in Antlr 3.1. So, a few questions:

1. Did anything change between these versions that might cause
something like this?

2. Did anything change with the way &quot;returns&quot; are done? I didn't
notice anything in the documentation, but my expression rules in the
tree grammar do lots of stuff like this:

expression	returns[ExpressionValue eval, ExecutionStep step]
	:
		NOT expr = expression
	{
		//do some processing
		$eval = result.getValue();
		$step = result.getStep();
	}
Do I need to change this to be 3.3 compatible in some way?

Any tips would be appreciated,

Stefik

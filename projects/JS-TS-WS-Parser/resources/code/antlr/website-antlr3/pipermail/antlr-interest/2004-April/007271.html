<PRE>I was reading the Antlr tutorial by Ashley J.S Mills and was wondering 
about the newline function.  She (or maybe he), says

&quot;newline() method which tells Antlr to bump up it's line count and goto 
the next line.  Without this the lexer would be stuck on one line!&quot; page 9 
if printed

This has to do with her example of 

WS      :
        ( ' '
        | '\t'
        | '\r' '\n' { newline(); }
        | '\n'       { newline(); }
        )
        { $setType(Token.SKIP); }
        ;

I am also checking for which space and newlines, however I do not have the 
newline function being used (also don't have the setType call).  When I do

java Main
test
MATCHED TEST
test
MATCHED TEST
test
MATCHED TEST

that appears to me that antlr is handling newline just fine without the 
function call.  Any idea if I am wrong or am I missing something from the 
tutorial?

Thanks
Ron

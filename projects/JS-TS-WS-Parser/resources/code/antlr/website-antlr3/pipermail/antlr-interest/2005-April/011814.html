Hi Loring,

Yep, I definitely have been thinking about refactoring and such.  I am 
also thinking about exemplar-based grammar development; got some cool 
ideas.

Thanks for the list of stuff...need to add &quot;remove left-recursion&quot; i 
think.

As for the aspect stuff, I think Monty may be right that simply 
modifying the code gen template locally could be promising.  You might 
have some standard mods in a lib dir somewhere then use 
target=TraceJava instead of target=Java or something.

&gt;<i> REFACTORING SUPPORT
</I>&gt;<i> The basic refactorings for parser/lexer grammars (they also apply to 
</I>&gt;<i> tree
</I>&gt;<i> grammars, but I can identify a much richer set of tree refactorings) 
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> can be easily implemented include
</I>&gt;<i> 1.)  Rule renaming (all references are renamed)
</I>&gt;<i> 2.)  Extract rule (replaces &quot;all&quot; instances of a given token sequence 
</I>&gt;<i> with a
</I>&gt;<i> rule reference--user should get yes/no choices for each instance)
</I>&gt;<i> 3.)  Inline rule (case-by-case or global)
</I>&gt;<i> 4.)  Clone rule (Copies and renames a rule definition; user is given
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity to select which version applies for every reference to the
</I>&gt;<i> original rule).  Usually, the cloned rule will then be &quot;specialized&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> to have
</I>&gt;<i> a different set of actions and/or attributes from the original rule.
</I>&gt;<i> 5.)  Transform loop to recursion
</I>&gt;<i> 6.)  Transform recursion to loop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And, with only a little more effort
</I>&gt;<i> 7.)  Left factor alternatives in rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One big advantage grammars have for refactoring is that you do not 
</I>&gt;<i> have much
</I>&gt;<i> semantic state to worry about; I'd be very surprised if it took more 
</I>&gt;<i> than a
</I>&gt;<i> few days to implement all of the above functionality--especially 
</I>&gt;<i> considering
</I>&gt;<i> that most of the underlying support routines are probably already 
</I>&gt;<i> present.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SOURCE-TO-SOURCE manipulations
</I>&gt;<i> There is quite a bit that can be done simply by regenerating grammars 
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> addition/subtraction of features with what should be minimal effort.  
</I>&gt;<i> It
</I>&gt;<i> would be nice if some of these were supported at the editing level.
</I>&gt;<i> 1.)  Extract/import target source:  This would be to enable 
</I>&gt;<i> refactoring of
</I>&gt;<i> action code.  Basically, the idea is to extract the usual block of 
</I>&gt;<i> action
</I>&gt;<i> code (methods) plus all actions (including semantic predicates).  The 
</I>&gt;<i> action
</I>&gt;<i> snippets would be extracted as methods, perhaps named &lt;rule&gt;action&lt;n&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> (the
</I>&gt;<i> naming should make re-import easy).
</I>&gt;<i> 2.) pre-Aspect ANTLR:  Insert actions after ':' or before ';', 
</I>&gt;<i> before/after
</I>&gt;<i> '(', ')', ')+', ')*', ')?' in cloned grammar.  This, coupled with
</I>&gt;<i> extract/inline rule, encompasses most of the functionality of an Aspect
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR; additionally making the insertion dependent on finding a 
</I>&gt;<i> sequence of
</I>&gt;<i> token types would provide most of the remaining support needed.  (Note 
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> this provides a simple mechanism for the &quot;traceIn/traceOut&quot; feature of 
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR
</I>&gt;<i> 2 and PCCTS).  Monty might have some further suggestions.
</I>&gt;<i> 3.)  Test rule generator:  clone the grammar, adding a top-level rule 
</I>&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;<i> has each rule as an alternative, with a preamble.  (The preamble might
</I>&gt;<i> recognize &quot;test&quot; &lt;rule&gt; and then a sequence of tokens representing a 
</I>&gt;<i> test
</I>&gt;<i> case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These require more effort than the refactoring support, but the added
</I>&gt;<i> capability would probably be more than worth the effort.

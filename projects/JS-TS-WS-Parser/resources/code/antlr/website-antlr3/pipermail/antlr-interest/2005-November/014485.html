For the C++ support code I've been experimenting with this. It works
really great, by plugging in different Position Tracking objects you get
a customized lexer that only tracks what's needed. Even on small toy
grammars this safes quite some space. (and hopefully also overhead)

The only thing I still need to figure out is the d*mn unicode handling,
where you have issues with binary offset and logical (character) offset.
For unicode I only want to decode a character once, but that's tricky
atm with how I set up the prototype.

I'll only maintain one version e.g. a templatized version. A C++
compiler that can't deal with basic templates should go the dino way
asap. But if someone wants to maintain another version he's welcome :)

Cheers,

Ric

ANTLR will make all the Java syntax available to you in an AST to
manipulate with pure Java code, an ANTLR tree parser, or whatever.

By using something the JDT DOM, you will get *extra* support on top of
syntax recognition.  e.g. given...

  foo.get(bar)

...either approach will tell you that you've got a method call, but a
good Java representation will directly support you being able to ask for
the types of the different variable references, so that you could
translate, for instance, java.util.List accesses in one way, and
java.util.Map accesses in another.  

Then, you code-up a load of translation logic based on what the model
exposes from the source.

Of course, this approach is trying to do a better job with the
language-specific issues, so it won't really help when you switch to a
different input language, like C++.

So, if you're just looking to translate syntax, ANTLR on its own will do
well.  If you want to translate some (tiny part) of the semantics too,
consider a framework that 'knows' the code better.

Finally, even *if* you go for a more complex/capable representation, it
will still fail to handle the really fiddly cases, like translating
idioms between languages.

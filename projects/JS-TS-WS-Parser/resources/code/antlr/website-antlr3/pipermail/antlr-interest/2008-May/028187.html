&gt;<i> Hello, I started poking a bit at ANTLR today after crawling all over the 
</I>&gt;<i> web site and wiki.  I am generating a C# lexer and parser and had a 
</I>&gt;<i> couple of comments and questions.  Mostly I think my problems are 
</I>&gt;<i> version confusion.  FYI I'm using VSPro 2008 but it doesn't seem to be 
</I>&gt;<i> causing any problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I quickly noticed that the CSharp target doesn't quite work the same 
</I>&gt;<i> between ANTLR 3.0.1 and 3.1b2 (which I believe are the versions that 
</I>&gt;<i> I've tried, using ANTLRWorks 1.1.7 and 1.2b2).  I am referencing 
</I>&gt;<i> Antlr3.Runtime.dll from the source download (that being the only runtime 
</I>&gt;<i> I could find), I think it's a 3.0.1 runtime.
</I>
Under &lt;<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/download/build/">http://www.antlr.org/download/build/</A>&gt; you can get the latest 
daily builds. Unfortunately, the last one is a bit outdated as well. Ter 
should push a new one soon.

&gt;<i> Using the Antlr3.Runtime.dll and AntlrWorks 1.1.7, I am able to tokenize 
</I>&gt;<i> and parse in a little command line C# app.  I can't do the parse tree 
</I>&gt;<i> example and I am not generating AST nodes so it's not super useful yet 
</I>&gt;<i> but it runs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Q: Is a .net runtime of ANTLR 3.1 available yet, and if not when 
</I>&gt;<i> approximately will it appear?  Am I correct in assuming the runtimes 
</I>&gt;<i> provided in the 3.0.1 source distribution are the older 3.0.1 and 2.7.7 
</I>&gt;<i> runtimes?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd rather go CSharp2 for everything, for one thing, and for another 
</I>&gt;<i> thing it appears that in the 3.0.1 runtime there's no such thing as 
</I>&gt;<i> Antlr.Runtime.RecognizerSharedState --- so I can't generate a parse tree 
</I>&gt;<i> based on the wiki's example (I am guessing this is C. Mundi's problem as 
</I>&gt;<i> well).
</I>
The daily build includes a new library version.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Q: Is the following fixable and am I even understanding the problem 
</I>&gt;<i> properly?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using options{language=CSharp2} doesn't work, I believe I'm at least 
</I>&gt;<i> missing the CSharp2.stg file and I am getting an error to this effect.  
</I>&gt;<i> This seems contrary to the documentation which suggests it should work 
</I>&gt;<i> under ANTLRWorks 1.2b2/ANTLR 3.1b2.  It doesn't seem to be provided in 
</I>&gt;<i> the downloadable sources, but that makes sense because the sources 
</I>&gt;<i> appear to be for ANTLR 3.0.1 (and CSharp2 is new as of ANTLR 3.1, right?).
</I>
Correct. The appropriate sources are included in the daily build. 
ANTLRworks 1.2b2 doesn't support CSharp2 yet - it includes a too old 
version of ANTLR.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Q: Is there a practical way to contribute documentation for the .net 
</I>&gt;<i> assembly so that Intellisense becomes useful?
</I>
What resources does Intellisense need actually? As I can use the source 
files I don't have difficulties with Intellisense myself, but that 
doesn't help you. In the case of still missing data, we can talk about 
further contributions.

&gt;<i> Not having any intellisense documentation is kind of a bummer.  I notice 
</I>&gt;<i> that the online Java documentation is close but not quite in line with 
</I>&gt;<i> the CSharp target (for one thing, in the 3.0.1 Java target, 
</I>&gt;<i> RecognizerSharedState exists).
</I>
My guess is that the docs describe not 3.0.1, but an alpha version of 3.1.

&gt;<i> Finally, one comment: It is hugely confusing for the documentation to 
</I>&gt;<i> reference ANTLR 3.1 as if it exists when various features don't yet 
</I>&gt;<i> exist as far as I can tell.
</I>
I've made it a bit more clear in one case that I refer to a new version 
of ANTLR. Otherwise you are simply using the wrong libraries and sources.

Johannes

&gt;<i>  Is this a problem with the documentation or 
</I>&gt;<i> do I simply not have the right versions of things yet?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any help on these matters would be greatly appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> thanks,

There are a few tricks that can be applied to ANTLR implementation. 
One is simply to sort token types by name before numbering them; it
might also be desirable to add an aliasing option to go along with
this, and to make the &quot;=&lt;number&gt;&quot; part of the &lt;tokens&gt;.txt entries
optional (number assigned by sequence, as in &quot;C&quot; enums) to support
merges and use of diff'ed output.  Back-translating items such as
LITERAL_if (to &quot;if&quot;) might be useful, as well.

Another approach at the application level is to support a renumbering
&quot;visitor&quot; pass that translates between two token mappings.

I've worried at this issue off and on because I think that it may be
practical to use parse trees as an output formatting device.  Parse
tree grammars can be automatically generated for any input grammar; by
transforming another language into that parse tree format, it might be
possible to quickly develop a language translator for paradigmatically
similar languages.  More flexible token numbering support is worth
considering for ANTLR 3.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;/java&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ===
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Presumably, I want to build an AST that looks like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (DOCUMENT (TEXT &quot;This is a document with C code and Java code:\n&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   (C (CLASS (NAME &quot;Bar&quot;) ...))
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   (TEXT &quot;\nJava is here.\n&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   (JAVA (CLASS (NAME &quot;Foo&quot;) ...)))
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and then use a tree walker to do my work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Assume that I have an independently created C parser and Java parser
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that I want to just use.  I can't just use in my own parser
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; options {
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   importVocab = CParser;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   importVocab = JavaParser;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; }
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so I have to do something else.  As I mentioned, what I am doing is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; generating a CommonTokenTypes.txt by parsing the CParserTokenTypes.txt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and JavaParserTokenTypes.txt and merging the vocabularies, and then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; importing Common back into CParser and JavaParser and regenerating.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This seems to be exactly what you are proposing:  ensuring that a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Common vocabulary be imported!  Or am I misunderstanding you?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Gang,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [warning: this got long] ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good question / interesting problem.  Since I'm working on the vocab 
</I>&gt;<i> stuff for 3.0 at the moment, perhaps I'll think about this for a 
</I>&gt;<i> paragraph or two or ten.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem you have is that both a C and a Java grammar will export 
</I>&gt;<i> the same token, say, IF with different token types.  Moreover, the 
</I>&gt;<i> parsers have generated constant defs that say IF=342 and IF=2 or 
</I>&gt;<i> something.  Seems like it would be pretty hard to get a single lexer to 
</I>&gt;<i> generate two different values.  Ok, so that means one needs to have 
</I>&gt;<i> separate lexers for both C and for Java.  No problems as the token 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;spaces&quot; are then totally independent.  One simply needs an overall 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;controller&quot; (could be a higher-level grammar) that invokes the C or 
</I>&gt;<i> Java parser.  Problem is the trees of course...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Second choice is as you did: create a merged vocab and have both C and 
</I>&gt;<i> Java parsers/lexers import that merged vocab.  Only trouble is that the 
</I>&gt;<i> vocab files needed to merge are created after ANTLR has generated the 
</I>&gt;<i> parsers so one needs to run ANTLR again on the C and Java parser to get 
</I>&gt;<i> their token types in sync.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One could have the Java parser import the C parser's vocab then the 
</I>&gt;<i> output vocab of the Java parser would be the combined one.  The C 
</I>&gt;<i> parser would have to be regenerated though.  This is a drag.  I wonder 
</I>&gt;<i> if we shouldn't change the problem around.  You are really saying that 
</I>&gt;<i> you want to build a new grammar composed of other grammars.  That is, 
</I>&gt;<i> you want to import the grammar not the vocabulary really.  I plan on 
</I>&gt;<i> *not* allowing inheritance ala ANTLR 2.x.  It will become grammar 
</I>&gt;<i> composition or I may leave it to an IDE tool living above ANTLR to do 
</I>&gt;<i> the composition, but for now let's look at what it might look like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> grammar combined;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> import C; // include all rules from C
</I>&gt;<i> import Java.expr; // include rule expr and all rules invoked by expr
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this way, the token type issue is resolved because I don't have to 
</I>&gt;<i> rely on two different recognizers generated with independent token 
</I>&gt;<i> types.  I would literally cut/paste (like I did with inheritance) the 
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate rules into the new combined grammar.  Yes, i have to 
</I>&gt;<i> cut/paste because rules are not independent.  If I override a rule in 
</I>&gt;<i> combined that is invoked by a rule in Java or C grammars then every 
</I>&gt;<i> rule could change it's lookahead (this is very unlike method 
</I>&gt;<i> inheritance).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now on to trees.  Problem is solved because ID for both input grammars 
</I>&gt;<i> is now the single ID of combined grammar.  Any trees created have the 
</I>&gt;<i> unique ID token type value. :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are systems such as Visser's SDF that allow grammars to be reused 
</I>&gt;<i> when they are placed in so-called &quot;modules&quot;.  You can import whatever 
</I>&gt;<i> rules you want or whole grammars.  You can set parameters too.  I can 
</I>&gt;<i> imagine a generic rule for a list of IDs that could handle 
</I>&gt;<i> comma-separated, colon-separated, or whatever lists.  You could define 
</I>&gt;<i> the grammar like a template:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> grammar commonStuff;
</I>&gt;<i> idList&lt;separator&gt; : ID (&lt;separator&gt; ID)* ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then in another grammar, you could do this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> grammar whatever;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> import commonStuff.idList&lt;COMMA&gt; as idList;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> decl : &quot;int&quot; idList SEMI ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Something like that.  Looks cool, but you know every time I try to 
</I>&gt;<i> think of a really great example of re-usage with parameterized rule 
</I>&gt;<i> imports, I get stuck.  Seems like just plain &quot;import a bunch of rules&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> is what we want.  The normal usage would be to import an existing 
</I>&gt;<i> grammar and then change a few rules (for syntax or action changes) or 
</I>&gt;<i> to import rules from a few grammars to make a new one.  The latter case 
</I>&gt;<i> is the only time it's more &quot;powerful&quot; than plain single inheritance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Still I question whether even this is that useful (ignoring tree 
</I>&gt;<i> walkers for now).  Are you really ever going to build a new grammar by 
</I>&gt;<i> grabbing the Java expr rule set and the C statement set and then 
</I>&gt;<i> somehow hope the merged grammar will work?  Perhaps if we made smaller 
</I>&gt;<i> grammars that were really just grammar subsets that were useful.  
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm...even then, I've never ever been in a situation where I felt I 
</I>&gt;<i> could wholesale grab large chunks of another grammar and reuse without 
</I>&gt;<i> serious modifications (read that cut/paste and modify).  Now, I start 
</I>&gt;<i> most grammars by having to type or cut/paste lexer rules such as ID, 
</I>&gt;<i> WS, INT, and so on.  I can see importing lexer rules as they are 
</I>&gt;<i> independent of each other, but an IDE could simply let you pick from a 
</I>&gt;<i> list of standard lexical rules to get you started.  Seems hardly worth 
</I>&gt;<i> complicating the tool for this simple application.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Back to trees with vocab not grammar imports...I'd like to hear from 
</I>&gt;<i> Monty to hear more about his use of combined vocabs in his tree walkers 
</I>&gt;<i> and his use of inheritance.  I think Monty made a tree supergrammar 
</I>&gt;<i> that had all the tokens in it and then each tree walker phase of the 
</I>&gt;<i> translator subclassed that grammar to get all the tokens.  That is 
</I>&gt;<i> basically the same as doing an importVocab on a combined vocab you 
</I>&gt;<i> built.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In summary, i have no good solution ;)  Can anybody add to this 
</I>&gt;<i> conversation about importing grammars and such?

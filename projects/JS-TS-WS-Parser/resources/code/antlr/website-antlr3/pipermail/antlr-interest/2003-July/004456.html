<PRE>You misunderstand.  An attribute syntax would also need to be added 
(not a problem--that would provide a base for specifications that 
could be for used automatic AST class generation) to properly support 
heterogeneous AST classes, but I think that we should do that anyway.  
The idea of using a &quot;smart custom allocator&quot; sounds good in theory, 
but may not save much in practice--initialization still has to be done 
for each &quot;new&quot;, and a good allocator is already fairly efficient for 
reusing memory blocks.

As far as the usage that you mention, the major impact would be to 
move some AST processing from the parsing pass to a tree walker 
pass.  I don't see that as being a problem.

ANTLR 3 tree support (including heterogeneous AST) will be better and 
more actively maintained--my version of antlr.g uses heteroASTs 
for tree grammar construction--than in ANTLR 2.

</I>&gt;<i> Really!  That seems a little extreme to me.  Not only does it remove 
</I>the
&gt;<i> ability to work on the heterogeneous ASTS, it seems to remove the 
</I>ability to
&gt;<i> work on the current AST completely?!?  Do you really think it will

&gt;<i> it do this?  Wouldn't a clever allocator (that recycled ASTs) be 
</I>much
&gt;<i> better?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would be really disappointing (in my opinion) because I work on 
</I>the

&gt;<i> nodes with relationship information).  Sure I have to do a silly 
</I>cast now
&gt;<i> (because of the lack of heteroAST support), but I couldn't even use 
</I>my
&gt;<i> casting trick in this case! (if I'm understanding you correctly)

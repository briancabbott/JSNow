If you use the -html switch to antlr.Tool, you can generate HTML which 
contains just the grammar.  You can then copy and paste the grammar, without 
actions, back into a text file and you now have an action free grammar.

It's kind of a hack, but it should work.  I find the formatting particularly 
annoying, but that's just my personal preference....

Hope that helps.

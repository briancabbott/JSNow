<PRE>Hello,

I am looking for a person who is experienced with ANTLR for writing a parser
for a rather unique prolog-like language.

I have all code for actually producing the executable ready, but currently,
my parser is based on regular expressions and string matching (which means
the error handling is not too good either). I wish I had more time to dive
into ANTLR and write proper grammar/parser, but unfortunately, I do not.
Still, I would like to distribute this language as open source (with a
&quot;real&quot; parser), as I believe it is unique and interesting both industrially
and for educational purposes as well.

If anyone is interested, I can send him/her more details, with possibly a
prototype of a BNF grammar. If someone is interested in being paid for
writing a grammar/parser (in Java), I may be willing to accept a reasonable
offer. I believe the language itself is not that complex, a person with good
experience with ANTLR and Java should be able to develop a working prototype
in two to three working days.

Any other ideas where I could find such a person are appreciated.


Thanks,


Jerr.

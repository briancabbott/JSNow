<PRE>Hehe neat trick, developing without installing devtools ;)
I think you're misunderstanding , Antlr can generate python as output -
it isn't written in python. When people say Antlr c#/python/java,
they're talking about the code it generates not the language Antlr is
written in.
if you don't want to install the java runtime, you can download the
precompiled win32 binaries which should grant you your wish of avoiding
c# &amp; java ;) IIRC there's a link to the binaries somewhere on the Antlr
home page.


Cheers,

Subject: [antlr-interest] Newbie Question - does antlr.py work?

I am trying to use Antlr with Python.  I have a Windoze box that does
not have Make or any compilers.  I don't have Java or C#, nor do I wish
to use them.

I used a .msi file to install a binary on my system.  In the lib
directory is a file called antlr.py, which looks like it should be the
program.  But I cannot seem to use it.  Can I create my parser files
using:

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>python antlr.py test.g
</I>...which should spit out the parser, lexer, etc.?

If so, what is the secret to doing this?  It seems that if I build from
source on my computer, something like that may work, but as I said, I
cannot do that.  I don't understand the Python examples because it looks
like you need Make in order to use them.

If this is not possible, then what exactly is the purpose of the file
antlr.py?

Thanks,
gevans

<PRE>Hi,

I'm finalizing how lexers emit tokens and possibly alter the text for  
tokens.  I thought I'd run the ideas past you to make sure I'm not  
crazy (about this anyway!) :)

There are a few main things I want to be able to do:

1. emit more than one token per lexer.nextToken() invocation (needed  
for python etc...)

2. allow you to modify the text of a text either with setText() or  
text=foo;

3. allow ! on lexical rule elements to delete text elements from  
token easily

4. I need the common case to be fast and I don't want to clutter up  
the simple Lexer object

Re #1: Currently, there is an emit(Token) method that can be  
overridden to have a queue; nextToken would then be overridden to  
pull from the queue.  When the user emits manually, the token rule  
must avoid doing so.  Sounds easy but what happens when one rule  
calls another?

FLOAT : INT '.' INT ;
INT : '0'..'9'+ ;

How does INT know not to emit a token?  Currently I check &quot;if token! 
=null emit&quot; but that emits two tokens.  So I think I need to add a  
lexical rule nesting level var and a check &quot;if token!=null &amp;&amp;  
level==0 emit&quot;.  That adds extra work and each rule would need to  
have inc/dec code for the level.  This infrastructure will still work  
for multiple token emits as emit can just set token to the last token  
emitted to prevent auto emitting.

Re #2: you need to be able to set the text of a token.  There is the  
notion of a single token being matched and so it's ok to have the  
idea of &quot;current text&quot;; i.e., an instance var.  A setText method can  
alter a String and auto token emit can use this instead of indexes  
into the charbuf if nonnull.  Easy until you realize you might want  
to modify it as a buffer of char.  Then it must be a StringBuffer not  
just a string...may be hard to avoid creating a buf for each  
nextToken invocation.  Still it's pretty straightforward.

Re #3.  Now, we need automatic modification of a text buffer to build  
up a string.  Users should be careful doing manual alteration of a  
buffer and using ! on elements.  The first ! that is encountered even  
if deeply nested in multiple lexer rules must create a buffer and  
copy all text from start of token (in the char buffer) to the new  
StringBuffer.  At level==0, we need to add whatever other text  
remains and we need to emit a token using either the modified buffer  
or just pointing into the char buffer (for unmodified text).

Re #4.  We end up with a complicated chunk of code at the end of each  
lexer rule, which costs time/space:

         // token rule postamble
         level--;
         if ( token==null &amp;&amp; level==0 ) {
             if ( _buf!=null ) {
                 _buf.append(input.substring(_start, getCharIndex()-1));
             }
             emit(type,line,charPosition,channel,start,getCharIndex 
()-1);
         }

To avoid creating a new StringBuffer each time, I could reuse and set  
the length to 0 at the start of each nextToken.  Otherwise I need to do

if ( _buf==null ) { _buf = new StringBuffer(); }

at each char reference or other element with a bang.  So, i guess I  
need &quot;if ( _buf.length()&gt;0 )&quot; check not _buf==null check.  I hate to  
slow down the token matching speed for every token to set the length  
(the StringBuffer.setLength() method actually requires a fair bit of  
code).

Anybody wanna comment on the implementation?

Ter

Hi!
I've some language with good LL(1) grammar.
1. I need to develop an interactive interface for &quot;stupid&quot; user.
   It means the interface has to incorporate hiding options (tokens)
   which are impossible to enter after some sequence of tokens.
2. Also the interface has to incorporate options to &quot;remove last word&quot;
   i.e. going back and reenter some input.

As for problem 1 - I don't quite understand how should I use FIRST and
FOLLOW in my case since because of 2 reasons:
1. I have to provide lookahead token before production is made, so I
   have no alternatives for the LA (am I correct)
2. assume we have r1 -&gt; X r2 Y and some more rules using the r2.
   after going to r1 and making r2 production my exected is FIRST(Y)
   which is subset of FOLLOW(r2).
   How can I know it before getting back to r1 from r2?

Problem 2:
I understand that backtracking here is bad idea because of actions which
have to be either undone or abandoned.
Is reparsing the whole sequence the only option?
Maybe &lt;wordback&gt; should be special unhandled token which will cause
an expception? But how then can I get back to the correct state?

Thank you in advance,

Nick

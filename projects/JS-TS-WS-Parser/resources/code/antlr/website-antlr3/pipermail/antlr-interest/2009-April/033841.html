But by the sound of it, in Ola's case, at lest some of the collisions 
are of the sort I describe:

&gt;<i>      [java] warning(200): ioke.g:269:5: Decision can match input such as &quot;'#'&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> using multiple alternatives: 1, 2
</I>&gt;<i>      [java] As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input
</I>
Okay, that sounds like it probably ought to be factored, from what 
little info we have.

&gt;<i>      [java] warning(209): ioke.g:323:1: Multiple token rules can match input
</I>&gt;<i> such as &quot;'#'&quot;: T__38, Identifier, StringLiteral, RegexpLiteral, LineComment
</I>&gt;<i>      [java] 
</I>&gt;<i>      [java] As a result, token(s)
</I>&gt;<i> Identifier,StringLiteral,RegexpLiteral,LineComment were disabled for that input
</I>
At least T_38 is presumably finite-length and shouldn't be included. 
Something sounds odd in the language if identifiers, string literals, 
regex literals (and they are separate?) and one-line comments can all 
start with a hash...

&gt;<i>      [java] warning(209): ioke.g:202:1: Multiple token rules can match input
</I>&gt;<i> such as &quot;'['&quot;: T__34, Identifier
</I>&gt;<i>      [java] 
</I>&gt;<i>      [java] As a result, token(s) Identifier were disabled for that input
</I>
Ditto above

&gt;<i>      [java] warning(209): ioke.g:202:1: Multiple token rules can match input
</I>&gt;<i> such as &quot;'{'&quot;: T__36, Identifier
</I>&gt;<i>      [java] 
</I>&gt;<i>      [java] As a result, token(s) Identifier were disabled for that input
</I>
And again...

Sounds like something may well be a bit wrong with the grammar (would 
have to look at it to judge better), but sounds like something is wrong 
with the ambiguity detection (or it's falling back to k=1 without saying 
so) as well.

Probably.

However, it's important to realize that ANTLR &quot;only&quot; helps create 
syntactic recognizers. There is much more to  writing language 
interpreters than merely performing syntax analysis. I've only resorted 
to YACC, Bison, JavaCC, ANTLR, etc. when I didn't dictate the language 
I had to accept. When I do, I've preferred to use S-Expressions. I 
wrote a Common Lisp reader for Java (complete with programmable reader 
macros and other CL fluff), and I generally use it as the starting 
point when I want an extension language.

From the philosophical perspective, it's just that the creation of 
entirely new languages should be viewed as something that demands a 
specific justification. The world (i.e., users; i.e., humans) do _not_ 
require more languages! They want to use the ones they already know!


&gt;<i> Get a already implemented grammar will help and save the day? If

</I>
How is that possible? We know nothing about your application's domain! 
Nothing about what you need to accomplish with a scripting / extension 
language. There are no generic solutions. (Except, of course, for 
S-Expressions...)

Languages are all about what you want to allow its &quot;speakers&quot; to be able 
to say and what you want to make succinct.


&gt;<i> Thanks!

</I>
After thinking about it, I wonder if what I'm really looking for isn't 
just a wizard. Something that would step through the grammar 
specification process, whip up a lexer and a parser, and then stay out 
of the way. Most of the rest of it could be done by differencing with 
existing languages:

What is the purpose of this recognizer: [ compiling | interpreting | 
rewriting | validating ]

Use traditional 'C' identifier tokens? [y/n]
Allow these extra characters *inside* an identifier: [_____]
Allow these extra characters to *start* an identifier: [______]

What operator syntax do you want to use: [C | Fortran | SQL]

What keywords do you want to start with: [C | C++ | Java | Eiffel | SQL 
|<i> Fortran ]
</I>
Edit the list of keywords here: [ (big text entry box) ]


This would obviously get more elaborate as more languages were brought 
into the fold, and it would also get more elaborate as more &quot;purposes&quot; 
were added -- possibly to the point of providing tree parsers 
automatically as well.



&gt;<i> Actually even the first half of that (input =&gt; token stream) would be 
</I>&gt;<i> a big help in many cases.  Since ANTLR doesn't have much debugging 
</I>&gt;<i> support for lexers, it's easy to accidentally break something in weird 
</I>&gt;<i> ways (especially if you don't have unit tests).
</I>
I'm working on that right now. I've got a rewrite of gunit that does 
token stream checking -- that's the string expression thingy I was 
talking about. I've got to actually &quot;go to work&quot; next week, but I'll 
probably have something alpha-ready sometime during or shortly after the 
holidays.

<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Hi all,

I'm looking to figure out ANTLR and so I'm reading this page:
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Quick+Starter+on+Parser+Grammars+-+No+Past+Experience+Required">http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Quick+Starter+on+Parser+Grammars+-+No+Past+Experience+Required</A>

But there are a number of things I'm stuck on - and so I'm asking here
for both a good explanation and so that someone with edit permission
can hopefully update the wiki page to actually be &quot;no past experience&quot;
and more helpful for future newbies.


&quot;Left recursion.&quot;
Maybe it's me being dim, but it took me a while to figure how &quot;a : a B
|<i> C ;&quot; translated to &quot;a : C B*;&quot; - and whilst I get it now, perhaps a
</I>quick sentence to explain the transition might be helpful for the wiki
page?


&quot;syntactic predicates&quot;
So, they're an advanced category discussed in a book... yippee! I
don't have the book, and the absolute earliest I could get it (if I
choose to) is Tuesday, so that's not particularly helpful. If they're
going to be mentioned, they should at least have a brief explanation
of when they apply, and preferably a link to an online resource that
covers them.
(I tried reading the Wikipedia article, but that waffles on without
being very helpful.)

Can anyone provide [a link to] a good, concise definition of syntactic
predicates and semantic predicates and any other terms like this - for
that matter, is there a good online glossary for all this sort of
compiler/parser related stuff?


&quot;Difference between lexer and parser rules&quot;
This whole paragraph leaves me going &quot;wha?&quot;. I don't know what the
difference between a lexer and a parser is, so attempting to explain
the difference between their rules doesn't mean much yet.

There's a vague suggestion that lexers look at literals (whether
explicit or combined via multiple rules), and parsers look at
everything else, but even then I'm not sure I get the implications of
that?

What's a symbolic name?

In the example, what does the &quot;EQUALS='=';&quot; syntax do? Should that be
a colon, or is something else happening?
What about IMAGINERY_TOKEN - what's that doing?

I'm now confused about tokens and non-terminal symbols - they are
obviously different, but how?

In the example for &quot;How to build a grammar from a language
specification&quot;, the FILE rule is not in the tokens section
Does that make it a non-terminal symbol?
Is this example grammar handled by a lexer or a parser or both?


I do have some other questions, but they're not directly related to
the wiki page, so I'll leave them for a later email, once I have a
better idea of what's what.


Thanks,

Peter

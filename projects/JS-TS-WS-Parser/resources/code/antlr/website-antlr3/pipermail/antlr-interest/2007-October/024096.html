<PRE>Either your parser is bombing out early or some construct is lacking within
it and it is just stopping at some point because of this. For a start, make
sure that you have a rule that looks for EOF as the last token, as this
might help you see why it is stopping early. After that, if cannot debug it
in ANTLRWorks, then you need to debug it in the target language (I am
presuming Java here as you don&#8217;t say, and Netbeans does a decent job if so).

Subject: [antlr-interest] Antlr parse cannot parse the file completly

 

Hi,

 

Need your help.

 

With the help of ANTLR i generated lexer &amp; parser from the grammar . The
grammer i developed for my requirement is to trace out indirect function
calls like function pointers.

 

My project directory contains 500+ files.I give one file at a time to the
parser.

But it seems it does not parse the file completely... i have put some
information below about the lines it lefts out.

 

FileName         Detects Upto Line       Last Line in the file
Difference

file1                 20997                        21415
418

file2                 15047                        15672
625

file3                 8187                          8187
0

file4                 430                           450
20

file5                18870                        18920
50

file6                7957                          7988
31

 

 

I tried to use the java command like this

java -Xmx1024m Main doutput.txt&gt;goutput.txt

 

(The doutput contains the file paths &amp; goutput contains the parsed data.)

But still it same.

Pls let me know am i doing mistake anywhere or some limitation??

 

Many Thanks..

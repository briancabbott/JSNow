The original grammar also has non-determinism warnings. I guess it should
do the 'right' thing in places where it happens. Some of them you can't
circumvent.

Indeed removing the language option for C++ is the right way to go. For the
C++ actions it depends wether you want #line information at least most of
it is to deal with #line statements if I recall right.

&gt;<i> The only thing that I need a clean grammar (without any antlr action

</I>
The only antlr grammar that does C++ I'm aware of is the one you used from
David. It depends on how thorougly you want to recognize C++ wether it will
work without action code or subsequent tree walking/post processing.

Cheers,

Ric

Verrrry interesting.  Wish I had been invited ;)

&gt;<i> Apparently, the gurus for a bunch of dynamic languages
</I>&gt;<i> (Perl, Parrot, Python, Groovy) had a little meeting at
</I>&gt;<i> Sun, and one thing they came away with had to do with
</I>&gt;<i> bytecode generation. To quote the article:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lesson: Bytecode Generation A lot of people these days are generating
</I>&gt;<i> bytecode: not just Jython and Groovy, but AOP tools and XPath/XSLT
</I>&gt;<i> tools and others too. They're all doing it by hand without any
</I>&gt;<i> abstractions to help, and it's difficult and messy and they're
</I>&gt;<i> probably not doing that great a job. &#182;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So it would be super-handy for a lot of people if there were a
</I>&gt;<i> higher-level approach to this, perhaps at the AST level, so you could
</I>&gt;<i> automate the bytecode generation for some common idioms like switches
</I>&gt;<i> and loops and so on. It's trickier than you might think, since the
</I>&gt;<i> semantics of something as apparently simple as assignment to a
</I>&gt;<i> variable can get very complex in a dynamic language.
</I>
I have thought about AST or other high level language neutral byte code 
gen myself as I hack out bytecodes.  My templates are pretty small for 
my DFA so it's no biggie, but I thought I should spend some time and 
package up my class file writer and assembler plus some high level 
stuff on top as a separate doohickie, but I already have too much to 
work on ;)

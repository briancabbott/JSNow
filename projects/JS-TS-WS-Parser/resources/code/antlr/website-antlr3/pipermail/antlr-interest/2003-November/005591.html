<PRE>Actually made it through the paper while getting nervous with the
proofs ;)

While he has linear time &quot;backtracking&quot; performance, ANTLR is worst
case exponential. I was wondering why: ANTLR does not combine its
depth first search (aka backtracking in this context) into a table
while Bryan's approach does (at least I understand it this way). The
problem Bryan will come across (given my understanding is halfway
correct) is ACTIONS. As with LR and combined states, the problem is
when to execute associated semantic actions. The drawback is well
known and and leads to reduction in parsing power. 

Might sound weird, but I thought if we still combined states even
though they are associated with different actions and simple execute
all actions, there would be no loss of power :) Silly? Not if you have
a transactional language that allows you to roll back actions that
turn out to be invalid later and roll forward the valid ones.

Technically this is possible. Does it make sense as well? Am I slowly
going crazy? ;)

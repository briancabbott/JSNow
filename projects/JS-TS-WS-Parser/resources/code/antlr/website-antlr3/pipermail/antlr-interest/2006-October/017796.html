&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is my new philosophy about translation:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Language L to L':  build a single tree structure and have multiple  
</I>&gt;<i> tree phases that use the same grammar but different actions.  Or, as  
</I>&gt;<i> we are discussing, you could have something that would skip certain  
</I>&gt;<i> pieces that you don't care about.  All of the phases up until last  
</I>&gt;<i> one will simply collect information, possibly annotating the tree  
</I>&gt;<i> nodes as well.  The last phase walks the tree grammar generating  
</I>&gt;<i> string templates that get put together and yield eventually one big  
</I>&gt;<i> string.  This is the approach I'm taking for Mantra.

</I>&gt;<i> Ter
</I>
The problem with this approach is that it will be *very* difficult to
work with only one tree structure. Say you're doing COBOL to
Java (as I am). Sounds like you're saying that all your phases work on a
&quot;COBOL AST&quot;, and the last step takes
the annotated &quot;COBOL AST&quot; and produces a &quot;Java AST&quot; (or just &quot;Java
text&quot;). The problem is that a &quot;COBOL AST&quot; looks almost nothing
like a &quot;Java AST&quot;, and in the later phases, it will be nearly impossible
to do Java-like processing. For example, my last
phase adds needed &quot;import&quot; statements by looking through the Java code
to see what's needed. To find out what
Java library classes are referenced, you really do need a copy of the
actual Java code to analyze, not
an annotated &quot;COBOL AST&quot;. Or how about adding try/catch blocks as
needed. Here, you need to not only look
for references to methods that throw non-Runtime exceptions, but need to
see whether exceptions are already being
caught.

This &quot;single tree structure&quot; approach might work if, at the start of the
last phase,
you essentially have the entire Java program existing in bits and pieces
as annotations on your COBOL tree. But I don't see how you could do
that, because the tree structures are quite
different. For example, In COBOL, you typically have a &quot;variable
representing a file&quot; declared in one place, its mapping to
a filename in another place, an &quot;open&quot; call in a third place. Those
three should map to a single
&quot;FileReader reader = new FileReader(&quot;myfile&quot;);&quot; Java statement.

You might think &quot;well, I can use multiple AST structures through
inheritence or heterogeneous trees&quot;, but that
just seems messy to me. I prefer an approach where you have, say, 100
phases. Each phase translates a small piece
(e.g. a single phase might handle the file-example above). So the code
gradually transforms from COBOL to Java,
one small step at a time.

Okay, I see what you are talking about. Java's Character class does have 
support for some catagories; see 
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/lang/Character.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/java/lang/Character.html</A>

Please look at the listed catagories and let me know if it is too 
limited. In particular, java.lang.Character.getType(), and the static 
final catagory constants.

&gt;&gt;<i>I was thinking of patching ANTLR's Java generator to be able to use

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
I would rather not have my Unicode-parsing application depend on IBM's 
library since I would have to distribute it. I think that the 
java.lang.Character class's support is sufficient.

Presumably, the modified ANTLR would then generate code like this:
     int type = Character.getType(LA(1));
     switch (type) {
        case Character.END_PUNCTUATION:
             mRULE(true);
             theRetToken=_returnToken;
             break;
        ....
     }

What do you think?

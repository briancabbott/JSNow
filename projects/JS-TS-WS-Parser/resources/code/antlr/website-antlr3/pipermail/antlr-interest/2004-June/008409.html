<PRE>Hi Monty,

Thanks a bunch. I was thinking about following your punctuation-rooting
solution. Right now, I'm thinking about adding LPAREN (left paranthesis) to
the tree and set its type to INIT_BEGIN (initialization begins with LPAREN
in my grammar). I sure will look at your GCC grammar and get back to you
soon. 

Thank you very much, again!

Bharath.

</I>&gt;<i> punctuations, it would lead to some or lot of non-determinisms. What's 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> usual way of handling this?
</I>
Two ways.  First is to use &quot;root&quot;ing appropriately to group things that 
belong together.  Sometimes I root with punctuation itself, like 
rooting with LPAREN, then dropping the RPAREN, which is implied by the 
end of the children of LPAREN.

Second is to root with imaginary nodes.  Like #(STATEMENT ...) which 
would imply the semicolon at the end of the statement's children.

Then sometimes you make the tree structure very regular to imply 
punctuation.  C's &quot;for&quot; construct allows empty loops like for (;;) -- 
remove the semicolons and then if there is only one expression in there 
you don't now if it is first, second or third.  So instead i use a NONE 
placeholder inserted by the parser.  Then my tree rule is like #(FOR 
expr expr expr) and one of expr's alts is NONE.

Plenty of examples are in my GCC grammar.

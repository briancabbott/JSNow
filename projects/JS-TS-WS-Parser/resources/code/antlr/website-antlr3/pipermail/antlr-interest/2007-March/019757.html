With the new gated predicate version of (...)=&gt;, the pred is always  
evaluated because that is what you said.  I cannot  know whether you  
have a pred that matches a longer string than the alt like:

A : ('a' DIGIT)=&gt; 'a'
    | 'a'
    | 'b'
    ;

For this, 'a9' must match first alt and 'a' must match 2nd alt.  No  
pred is evaluated for 'b' though.

ha hah hah!

&gt;<i> I think it's better to generate correct lexer/parsers, then to

yup.

&gt;<i> 2) leave it out if you can resolve it out correctly in advance.
</I>
that could be optimized out later if we can know.  Might be  
undecidable; figuring out if L(G1)==L(G2) is anyway if I remember.

Thanks!

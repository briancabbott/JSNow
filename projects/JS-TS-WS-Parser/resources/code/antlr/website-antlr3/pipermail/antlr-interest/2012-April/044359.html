<PRE>Aha!  Island grammars!  Thank you - that's the pointer I needed.

</I>&gt;<i> 1. Check out combined grammars. i.e. A grammar with an embedded grammar,
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. JavaScript inside of HTML. I believe the examples from the downloads
</I>&gt;<i> page has one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Token stream rewriting between the lexer and the parser. ANTLR includes
</I>&gt;<i> methods to help do this; they are noted in the API.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Just my thoughts or thinking out loud on this.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I played around with RTF a few years ago because I wanted to make an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> editor/diff tool that could add tags to change the properties of the text,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> i.e. color, underlining, etc., something like HTML. If I remember
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> correctly, one of the interesting aspects of RTF was that it was designed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to be read and processed sequentially in one pass. If the tags were done
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> correctly, you could start at a marked boundary and continue processing,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> even in the middle of the stream. This was highly advantageous when working
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with long documents of hundreds of pages or more.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> From the Rich Text Format (RTF) Specification Version 1.9.1
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;A sample RTF parsing reader program is given in Appendix A: Sample RTF
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Reader Application. This sample RTF reader is designed for use in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> conjunction with this document to assist those interested in developing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> their own RTF readers. The sample RTF reader is not a for-sale product, and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Microsoft does not provide technical support or any other kind of support
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for the sample RTF parsing reader code or this document. &quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I would seriously read the RTF specs first and truly understand how RTF
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> works before using ANTLR with it. You may be walking through a door you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> wish you never opened.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Do not take this as implying ANTLR is terrible. It is merely that you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> should use the right tool for the right job and here ANTLR is not the right
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tool, the tool you need is outlined in the RTF spec.

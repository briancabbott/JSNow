Well, not quite.  What actually happens is that every named lexer 
rule (including those listed in the &quot;tokens&quot; block) gets assigned 
a token type id -- you can see this in the .tokens file that it 
generates.

At the parser level, you are not referring to rules as such, you 
are just saying &quot;I am expecting a token with this type id&quot;.

Every lexer has a single automatic rule (&quot;Tokens&quot;, with the 
generated code in the mTokens method) which is what really gets 
called to generate the token stream.  This rule automatically 
refers to all lexer rules (and non-empty &quot;tokens&quot; block entries), 
except for those marked as being &quot;fragment&quot;s.  The rules called by 
the Tokens rule are usually called &quot;top level rules&quot;.

Each call to the mTokens method is expected to generate exactly 
one token; while by default the token type will match that of the 
top-level rule being called, but that rule can assign a different 
type if it wants to.  That's what is in play here.  Since all 
lexer rules (including fragments) have type ids, any of them are 
possible values.

&gt;<i>fragment DIGIT: '0'..'9'; // this is a genuine fragment rule
</I>&gt;<i>imaginary NUMBER: DIGIT+; // this is an imaginary / special token
</I>&gt;<i>imaginary FLOAT: NUMBER DOT NUMBER; // this is an imaginary / 
</I>&gt;<i>special token
</I>&gt;<i>generator INT_OR_FLOAT
</I>&gt;<i>   :  NUMBER // =&gt; NUMBER is implicit here?
</I>&gt;<i>      ( (DOT DIGIT) =&gt; DOT NUMBER { $type = FLOAT; } )?
</I>&gt;<i>   ;
</I>
I agree.  I find it a bit irritating that I can't say &quot;I'm 
creating this rule just for convenience; it doesn't need a token 
type id&quot;.  Although I'd probably be happier with something like 
this:

tokens { FLOAT; }          // imaginary: type id generated but no 
warning
fragment DIGIT: '0'..'9';  // fragment: no type id generated
fragment NUMBER: DIGIT+;   // again, no type id
INT                        // type id generated
   : NUMBER
     ( (DOT DIGIT) =&gt; DOT NUMBER { $type = FLOAT; } )?
   ;

This actually *is* valid syntax right now, but for some weird 
reason the use of purely imaginary tokens (those in the tokens 
block without bodies) started generating warnings for no apparent 
reason a while ago, and fragments have always generated type ids 
(and I don't think they should).

&gt;<i>       Because ANTLR assumes that all lexer rules are valid 
</I>&gt;<i> tokens, you must prefix
</I>&gt;<i>       factored &quot;helper rules&quot; with the fragment keyword. This 
</I>&gt;<i> keyword tells ANTLR
</I>&gt;<i>       that you intend for this rule to be called only by other 
</I>&gt;<i> rules and that it
</I>&gt;<i>       should not yield a token to the parser.
</I>[...]
&gt;<i>       The token type (nonzero positive integer) of the token 
</I>&gt;<i> such as INT;
</I>&gt;<i>       translates to a call to getType().
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>No mention of a restriction for fragment rules there, so one 
</I>&gt;<i>should be able to manipulate the type information in this case.
</I>
No, I think you're misinterpreting.  The first paragraph basically 
says &quot;rules marked with 'fragment' don't generate tokens&quot;, while 
the second says &quot;$type holds the type id for the token that will 
be generated&quot;.  From the combination it should be evident that 
$type is not valid in fragment rules.

&gt;<i>So when I see the keyword 'fragment' it is explicitly 
</I>&gt;<i>communicating 'do not refer to me in a parser rule'.
</I>
No, it's saying &quot;I don't automatically generate a token&quot;, which is 
not quite the same thing.

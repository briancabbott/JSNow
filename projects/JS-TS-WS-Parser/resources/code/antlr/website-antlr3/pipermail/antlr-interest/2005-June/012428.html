<PRE>Okay, I'm top-posting, which I actually think is naff, but unfortunately
(a) I don't have any choice about mail-client, and (b) I don't have any
choice about how it's configured. (Oh, and bottom posting is just as bad
- they both indicate a lack of concern about other people.)

The fact is, nettiquette was thrashed out as a very workable setup by
people who knew what they were doing. Things only got screwed up when a
couple of big corporations let hordes of clueless lusers onto the net.

Oh - by the way - which server are you going to &quot;fix&quot;? Because as far as
I'm concerned, Ter's server has nothing to fix, and I don't know what
other server has anything to do with this list.

Actually, there might be something to fix. I *think* list servers aren't
supposed to muck about with message ids, and any sensible mail client
should handle duplicate messages. But I guess that's too much to ask for
a lot of programmers ...

At the end of the day, the list is designed to &quot;fail safe&quot;. I'm on
plenty of others that don't, and it gets embarrassing the amount of
private mail that ends up where it shouldn't be ... or the lists that
WON'T let you &quot;reply sender&quot; so you *have* to reply to the list even
when it ought to be taken to private mail :-(

Cheers,
Wol

Ahem. 

One server. Many users.

Where does it make sense to fix the problem. Hmmmm...

Oh, I know, let's blame the many different clients that the many
different
users like and use.

If you find top-posting annoying, the server should allow you to
reformat
messages (like this one)that are only top posts. Some folks like
top-posting, esp if reading individual mails. I realize it's harder for
digest-readers, but the constant page-forward requirement of bottom
posting
makes it hard for single-mail readers. In short, the server should be
smart
enough to have a reformatting option.

Later,
-- Scott

&gt;<i> Maybe you should be blaming your mail client instead. The 
</I>&gt;<i> client I'm using allows me to define lists I am subscribed to 
</I>&gt;<i> and has 3 options for
</I>&gt;<i> replying: reply (to author only, which should be the 
</I>&gt;<i> reply-to), list reply (to the list address that I defined) 
</I>&gt;<i> and group reply (to all recipients).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And while we're talking about things that irritate, I find 
</I>&gt;<i> top-posting and quoting entire messages without using them as 
</I>&gt;<i> context to be quite annoying as well.

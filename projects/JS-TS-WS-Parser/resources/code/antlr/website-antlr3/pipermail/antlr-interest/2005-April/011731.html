<PRE>If you can wait a few days, I should have a beta of the latest version (with
a candidate antlr 2.7.6) available.
 
The existing plugin doesn't work properly with 3.1 (\t doesn't expand in the
editor). You can only use it with eclipse 3.0.x.
 
The existing plugin includes antlr 2.7.4.
 
If you can't wait a few days, or would like to help me test the plugin,
gimme a yell and I'll tell you where I've got the alpha test at. (It's in
really good shape, but I'd like some folks to bang on it).
 
If anyone else wants to help test the new plugin and the 2.7.6 candidate
(with JSR-45 debugging) and the XML support, drop me an email and I'll point
you to the update site.
 
Later,
-- Scott

Subject: [antlr-interest] Antlr-eclipse plugin



I posted a message on the antlr plugin page on sourceforge, but that doesn't
seem to have too much activity.  I'm trying to get more info on the plugin.
It's not really clear what pieces I need in order to install it, especially
on Eclipse 3.1.  I'm already running antlr 2.7.5

Thanks, 
Peter

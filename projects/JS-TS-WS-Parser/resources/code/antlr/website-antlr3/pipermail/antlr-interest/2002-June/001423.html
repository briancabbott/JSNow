<PRE>Monty--

I have the impression that attribute grammar systems implement 
aspect-oriented programming for language processing systems, and that 
Ter's idea for code generation also also has similarities.  AG systems 
tend to look fairly primitive--more like yacc than ANTLR in terms of 
level of useability--and have a fairly static view of attributes.  
There is room here for building something better for use with ANTLR, 
but the strength of aspects seem to be that they add orthogonal 
(&quot;cross-cutting&quot;) semantics to the inline semantics of procedural 
programs.  (AGs add semantics to otherwise semantics-free 
specification of syntactic structure.)

What you are suggesting for a proof-of-concept is almost equivalent to 
replacing the body of action statements with m4 macros and then 
running m4 over the generated code, but then adds the idea of implicit 
macros.  (I'm skeptical of the value of the implicit macros:  these 
seem more appropriate to adding orthogonal semantics, and I think that 
the explicit macros at least have the advantage of visual association 
of semantics to syntax.)  Language-independent specification of 
actions would be a *good thing*; is there any reason to go beyond 
this?  What am I missing--can you clarify your goals for adding 
aspects to ANTLR?

If you do importing at the level of grammar specification
(&quot;import ANTLRLexer.TOKEN_REF&quot;) then you run into the version 
problem--what happens when ANTLRLexer.TOKEN_REF is altered in the 
latest version?  I tend to believe that composition is best handled at 
the IDE level, not at a processing level.

&gt;<i> I would write:

<PRE>Hello Bart,

And thank you for your quick answer:

&gt;<i> The rule:
</I>&gt;<i> SOMETOKEN
</I>&gt;<i>  :  ('a')*
</I>&gt;<i>  ;
</I>&gt;<i> matches empty strings, and there are an infinite amount of them before your
</I>&gt;<i> input &quot;&lt;&quot;. This is probably the cause of the behavior you're
</I>&gt;<i> witnessing.
</I>Thus I understood that I was stuck in a thinking of looking at my example grammar in a BNF-like way (that way only &quot;a&quot; and the empty string would have been viable inputs to my grammar). Contrary to this perspective, the cause for the mentioned behaviour is the (inevitable) context-unawareness of the lexer, as I defined a lexer token possibly matching empty input.

&gt;<i> Change it into 'a'+ and see if things run differently.
</I>I changed the grammar as advised:

--------------------------------------------------------
grammar problem;

main_rule
        :       SOMETOKEN;

SOMETOKEN
        :       ('a')+;
--------------------------------------------------------

Executing the generated code on the input string &quot;&lt;&quot;, the before-mentioned memory usage disappears, but I get a seemingly endless stream of the following output lines on my console:

        &quot;line 1:0 required (...)+ loop did not match anything at character '&lt;'&quot;

Up to this point I thought, I got it. I assume, that the above output line is generated by the lexer. I defined only one lexer token in my grammar, which is wouldn't match an empty string anymore. So why doesn't the lexer stop after unsuccessfully trying to match the string - and runs on instead?

Thanks in advance and best regards,
   Ralf Cremerius

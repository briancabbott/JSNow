OK - I am still not following you exactly here. Do you mean that you
want the spaces and tabs to come back to the parser as individual
tokens? In which case you just specify them as part of lexer rules or in
their own lexer rule and they will come back as their own tokens.
Whitespace has no special meaning to ANTLR unless you make it so.

So you can say:

SPACE : ' ';
TAB : '\t';

or even:
TAB : '\t';

SPACE : ' ' (('   ')=&gt;'   ' { $type = TAB; })? ;

And the parser can say:

rule : indent DATA;

indent : (SPACE|TAB)* ;



&gt;<i> &gt; so if you just throw it away you won't have

</I>

Sure. It might not be the best way to parse it but there will be nothing
wrong with an ANTLR parser that does it, but the hairyness is what is
causing all your semantic predicates to be be necessary of course and
when they are combined in the generated code, they are causing all your
complicated if statements. The predicates are in the target language and
ANTLR does not really knwo what they are other than they are something
that can be used to give boolean true or false. 

We can see that:
:<i>
</I>{ A }?
{ !A} ?
;

Covers all cases and there is no need to ask if (A &amp;&amp; !A) then if (A)
else if (!A), but ANTLR does not know this. Of course, it is also
generating too many repeats of some of these things, as you surmise.

I wonder if you are trying to do too much in the parser and what you
really need is for the parer to pick up anything that looks like valid
syntax, and have it produce a tree, which you then walk and match up
indent levels and so on?

<PRE>Hi all,
 
I want to embed the C grammar in a C# program as an interpreted scripting language (what we use now is a rough approximation of C, and having the real C grammar would give us more functionality), and some searching brought me to Antlr.  I've played around with it a good deal now, and it's a great tool, but I'm getting to the point time-wise where I'd rather not re-invent the wheel if I don't have to, as fun as that may be.
 
I saw two example C grammars on the Antlr web site: a simple ISO C implementation in Antlr v3, and and GnuC extended one in Antlr v2.  I've gotten both built in their respective versions of Antlr, but neither one is quite right for my purposes.  The ISO C grammar doesn't build the ASTs (which would help me out a lot, compared to doing my own) and the GnuC grammar is written for v2 and I'm having trouble getting it to work with a C# target (I haven't seen any good examples of this in v2).  My question is, has anyone created an updated C grammar that outputs ASTs, preferably by updating the GnuC one to v3 (I wouldn't mind having the Gnu extensions)?
 
Thanks for any help!
 
Nick

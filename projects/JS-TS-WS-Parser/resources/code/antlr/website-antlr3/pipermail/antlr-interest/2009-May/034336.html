<PRE>My next question:

I am building an interpreter based on the ideas in 
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Simple+tree-based+interpeter.">http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Simple+tree-based+interpeter.</A>  
In particular, I am taking the first approach of starting a new tree 
parser for each function invocation.

Now I need to implement if statements (well, actually I have &quot;smaller?&quot;, 
&quot;notsmaller?&quot;, &quot;same?&quot;.... but once I get one figured out I can 
generalize...) and I'm not quite sure how to do it.  I read through the 
recent thread on this list &quot;Skip subtrees in tree grammar&quot; since it 
touches on this subject, but I don't see how to adapt what was discussed 
in that thread to my situation.

My parser builds trees as follows:


statement
    : ...
    |  SAME val val NL+  block --&gt; ^(SAME_CMD val val block)
    | ...
    ;


(where NL is a newline, val is essentially a standard expression rule, 
block is a list of statements)


Now in the tree parser, I have

statement
    : ...
    | ^(SAME_CMD a=val b=val .) {
                      int aval = $a.value;
                      int bval = $b.value;
                      if (a == b) {
                            // help ?!?
                      }
    }
    | ...
    ;

If I had ^(SAME_CMD a=val b=val block), then block is automatically 
evaluated before the action is run.  So it seems to me that I need to 
skip the block in the matching (as I have above) and then (at the spot 
marked 'help') get hold of the root of the block tree, create a new 
evaluator and run it.  But I haven't been able to figure out how to do 
that. 

One possibility I thought of was in the parser, each time I come to a 
block I could create a function with a unique name to wrap the block, 
but that seems like a kludge.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Matt

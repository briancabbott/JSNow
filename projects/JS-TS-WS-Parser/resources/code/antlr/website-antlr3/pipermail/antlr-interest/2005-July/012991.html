</I>
Not sure.. it can also be due to other parts of your grammar non 
determinism errors are usually dependent on your whole grammar (the 
links didn't work when I tried). Also you left out which rules in the 
above are protected. I would suspect that leftNumFactor should be 
protected in a lexer (all non protected rules get or-ed together in the 
nextToken rule which usually leads for newcomers to unexpected non 
determinism)

I'd be inclined to write the left factor like:

coefficient : INT {$setType(INT);}( DOT INT {$setType(FLOAT) )?;

&gt;<i> I am really in the dark here. I am sure I left factored right, so 
</I>&gt;<i> where is the problem ? I might mention that the program is working 
</I>&gt;<i> just as I wanted, but I feel bad about any warnings ;)
</I>
Some antlr warnings are hard to shut up. (I personally do not bother 
about them since adding/removing/modifying a rule can turn up things 
that you want to be warned about in spots were you previously turned of 
warnings)

&gt;<i> On the other hand, an alternate version of mine, which employs 
</I>&gt;<i> syntactic predicate on FLOAT and INT seems to work too, but issues 
</I>&gt;<i> similar nondeterminism warnings in the TreeWalker ?
</I>
Syntactic predicates are performance killers. Only use them during 
prototyping and when you really cannot do something else. Or if you have 
other reasons like readability etc.

&gt;<i> What am I doing wrong in the tree walker ?
</I>&gt;<i> Also, what are your views on left factoring vs. syntactic predicates 
</I>
Left factoring is better performance wise. It may kill the readability 
of your grammar though.

Cheers,

Ric

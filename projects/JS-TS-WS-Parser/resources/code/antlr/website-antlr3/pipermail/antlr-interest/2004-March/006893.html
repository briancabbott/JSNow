<PRE>I had trouble with the mutlti-pass translator/optimizer I built.

The translation was not 1:1  It produced an algorithmic numerical derivative
of the input expression (not a symbolic derivative).
Algorithmic derivatives accurately calculate the derivative of a function
numerically at a given point without using the small differences usually
found in
numerical derivatives, but you would not want to write the code by hand even
for simple functions.
So the tree manipulations were extreme with mulitple replications of
slightly different versions of various branches.

The problems mainly had to do with getting the result tree back into the
main tree without infinite loops and also cutting up, adding new sub-trees
and stitching back together various parts of the branch in one go.
I ended up doing most of it by hand coded optimization routines that worked
on expressions identified by the tree walker.

My comments on reworking of the tree syntax is an attempt to overcome this
problem as the hand coded stuff is
messy and hard to support now that I have forgotten what I was doing.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My understanding is that AntLR can be used to generate the front-end of
</I>a
&gt;<i> &gt; compiler (lex-parser-AST). What about the backend? (code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; generation/optimization?). As of now, I am getting clear ideas about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; defining the &quot;structured text&quot; language's syntax+semantics; How would i
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; convert it to bytecode?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, write a set of tree grammars that performs various tree
</I>&gt;<i> transformations (such as optimizations) and side effects (such as use-def
</I>&gt;<i> chains, constants table creation, etc.) and then a final tree grammar
</I>which
&gt;<i> takes all of that and spits out the output in your desired format.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, it goes without saying that the output of that last pass may
</I>&gt;<i> also be the input for other code generation tools.

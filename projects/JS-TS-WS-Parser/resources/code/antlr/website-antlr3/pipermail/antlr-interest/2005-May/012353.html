<PRE>Howdy,

In the old days, public domain was the most generous license to use  
for software.  Oddly enough, now it's not good at all.  I think a  
large company with 3 letters in their name has emailed me like 4  
times from different groups asking if I have a certification from  
every contributor of patches over the last 15 years that they had the  
right to submit the patch and that they granted me a license etc...   
You get the picture.  Basically, nobody wants to use software anymore  
that could include stolen work etc...

Going forward, I must ask that people submit everything through the  
website, which will track everything and have a &quot;contributor's  
license&quot; agreement etc...  It just asks that you certify you created  
whatever you're sending in and give me license to do whatever I want  
with it.  Here is my tentative language (in the box at the bottom):

Comments on the language and/or issues?

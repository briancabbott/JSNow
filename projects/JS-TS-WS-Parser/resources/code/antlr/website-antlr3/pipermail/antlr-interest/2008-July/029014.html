</I>Yes, UTF-16 characters may be 2x16 bit, but the decoding should not have 
to be in the grammar (which would be extremely impractical). It should 
be taken care of internally. As far as I can tell, this would require 
changing the LA method (which already returns an int) and adding another 
escape sequence for characters in the range from U+100000 to U+10FFFF (I 
may be wrong though).

Generally speaking, things have gone about as far
as they can possibly go, when things have gotten
about as bad as they can reasonably get.

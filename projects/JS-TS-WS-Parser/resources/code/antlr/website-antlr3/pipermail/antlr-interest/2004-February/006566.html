<PRE>I ran some tests comparing Lexers generated by different tools in
terms of speed. The sophistication of my Lexer specification that I
used as input for the Lexer generators is about that of a lexer for C.
The average numbers I found by repeatedly running the generated lexers
on a large source file were these:

ANTLR           8300ms
JLex            6500ms
JFlex 1.4pre5   2000ms
Flex            1900ms

I used current versions of all tools. For the ANTLR comparison I had
to adjust the Lexer specification, but tried to make it as efficient
as possible. For the Flex comparison, I basically called Flex's
yylex() function from Java via JNI. Also in the case of Flex I
generated fewer Java objects as output than for the others, and if I
take that into account, Flex's time would probably be more similar to
JFlex's.

I was surprised to find that ANTLR generated the slowest lexer.
Naturally, when interpreting these numbers keep in mind that the
outcome may have been different on a different lexer specification or
lexer input text. On the other hand, it makes sense to me that a DFA
would be faster on average than a more powerful recursive-descent parser.

Are there other performance numbers available? I have not been able to
dig up anything substantial. I also wonder how ANTLR-generated LL(k)
parsers perform compared to LALR(1) parsers.

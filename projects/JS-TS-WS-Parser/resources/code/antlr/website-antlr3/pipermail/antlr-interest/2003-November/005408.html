<PRE>While you're at it, check out port80.org--very cool, very spartan 
animation.  Judging from what SourceForge reports, Chris Leung seems 
to be fairly prolific.

I can't say that I like the LLK syntax (way too verbose for my 
tastes among other things).  As Oliver comments, he seems to have 
resurrected--or reinvented, more likely--the guarded predicates from 
PCCTS.

After poking around, I have to say that the code looks more 
ANTLR-influenced than ANTLR-derived--there is nothing that looks like 
ANTLR 2 internals (except in concept), and he has avoided reproducing 
the more eccentric design features of ANTLR 2 internals.  He's done 
the traditional lex/flex substring stuff in the lexer (match, but 
leave characters in place; store string start and end 
pointers/offsets) in token objects; he also has the DFA in NextToken() 
implemented for fixed character sequences, but not for keywords.

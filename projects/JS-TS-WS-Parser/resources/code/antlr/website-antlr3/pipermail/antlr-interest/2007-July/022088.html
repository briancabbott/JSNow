<PRE>&gt;<i>  &gt;I don't understand.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;I've reread the sentence below many times now, and I just can't
</I>&gt;<i> see
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;how it relates in any way to price. To say &quot;use...is permitted&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;implies nothing about price.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course not.  The BSD license is all about &quot;free as in liberty&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> not &quot;free as in beer&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, it's perfectly legal and in accordance with the license
</I>&gt;<i> if an up-front purchase is required to get the initial copy of the
</I>&gt;<i> source and/or binary -- it's just that the receiver of said source
</I>&gt;<i> is then at liberty to give it to others without charge or payment
</I>&gt;<i> if they wish, or charge for it if they wish to do that too.
</I>
Right! Consequently, were the author to attempt to charge for the
source, it would quickly end up on SourceForge or FreshMeat or some
other repository as a free (as in beer, not just liberty) source
distribution. I have never seen anybody attempt to sell copies of
BSD-licensed source code as a business model. (You could sell GPL
programs too--albeit you'd have to supply the source for free if
requested by someone with the binary--and the same result would
occur.)

It's not fair to look at the matter only theoretically. Practical
reality does matter.

Theoretically I have to agree that ANTLR is 100% open-source.
Practically -- well, I certainly found it hard to use ANTLR without
the book, which the main reason I bought it -- but I wouldn't go so
far as Scott. The fact that many programs are open source, but have no
documentation whatsoever (free or otherwise), should logically imply
that ANTLR--which has more documentation than those--is indeed
open-source. Even though the book is neither open nor source.

Hmmm!

I finally realize that we're beating a dead horse. Time to move on...

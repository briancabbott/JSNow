<PRE>Hi Dan,

&gt;<i> I just downloaded antlr 2.7.2, the zip file version. I'm trying to 
</I>build it
&gt;<i> with VC7, which by itself is not too difficult, starting from the 
</I>existing
&gt;<i> VC6 .dsp file. I've run into a few minor annoyances that were 
</I>easily fixed.
&gt;<i> Once I've gotten further along and verified the changes, I'd be 
</I>happy to
&gt;<i> send a diff if someone will tell me where to send it and how to 
</I>generate it.
&gt;<i> (I have the cygwin tools handy, I'm just not conversant with 
</I>generate patch
&gt;<i> diffs.)
</I>
A /tar/gzip/zip/etc archive with:
1. all changed files
2. all new files
3. instructions for updating a copy of antlr-2.7.2 
would be one useful way of submitting it. 

If your new archive can simply be extracted over a 2.7.2 installation 
(i.e the archived files contained paths relative to a 2.7.2 top-level 
dir), all the better. That's how C# support was added to ANTLR 
initially - grab the C# zipfile, extract into the ANTLR directory 
and.. done!.

Once you have that, just post it to the list and Ric (or one of us) 
would pick it up to test/integrate. Sample build-and-run scripts to 
allow straight forward testing of the changes would be great.

&lt;SNIP&gt;

&gt;<i> I've gotten the library to compile and link cleanly. Remains to be 
</I>seen if
&gt;<i> it works; I have to come back up to speed on ANTLR, since I haven't 
</I>used it
&gt;<i> in a couple of years.
</I>
A few words about your experiences with 2.7.2 compared to whatever 
version you were using before would be much appreciated. Perhaps try 
it on projects initially developed with the previous version?

Cheers,

Micheal

;) Before you ask, it's gcc 4.0.1 and yes it sucks...

I was talking about building up lists of matched tokens when building  
ASTs. Most of the time these lists are built up but not subsequently  
used in rewriting actions. I'm not totally sure whether I can  
influence this in codegen, or if ANTLR must detect this.
So in a sense, it is used, but useless...

I agree that time should be spent where it helps most. This is  
currently bugfixing and not getting rid of warnings about unused  
variables.

It surprises me that you don't have warnings about unused variables  
created for lookahead chars/tokens. They don't hurt and get optimized  
away properly but nevertheless they bug me. For my C grammar I get  
about 190 of the in the parser.
I could turn off these warnings, but I'd rather fix the cause than  
suppress the symptoms. But it is not pressing.

cheers,

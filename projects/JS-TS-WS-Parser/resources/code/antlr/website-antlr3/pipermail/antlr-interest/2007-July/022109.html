I'm happy to help.

Now perhaps you could help others in turn.

Messages to mailing lists with subjects like &quot;newbie question&quot; (you've 
sent two of these today!) are very uninformative. It's far preferable 
to put something specific in the subject. For example, for your first 
question, something like &quot;How do I include an apostrophe in a quoted 
string?&quot; would be suitable. For the second one (harder, admittedly) 
perhaps &quot;Help understanding ANTLR syntax error&quot; (since that' really all 
you have to go on, I take it).

Please try to keep in mind that mailing lists are not just 
ephemeral, &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; things, but rather permanent 
records of the attempts of a community of users' to use some particular 
software. When people use Google or other search service to look for 
help before themselves resorting to a list posting, meaningful subject 
headers will help them find knowledge that's already out there. That's 
something we all prefer to do, right? Help ourselves? Avoid burdening 
others?

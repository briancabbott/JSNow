Maybe, but Antlr is so cool ...

I did try replacing * with + and I got the same error.  Blech.  I really
didn't want to write a parser by hand for all of this.  I've got
significantly more to do than what I've got here, the rest of which
should be easy to handle for antlr.

So, there is really no viable way to have Antlr read the rest of the
line of input?  I would be happy to just write the Java code for that
one line:

shell -timeout 30 find /var/log -name ....

If I could just get hold of the input stream, read to end of line,
I could hand-parse the '-timeout N' part, etc., and then let the
lexer continue reading on the next line.  Is there no way to &quot;cut out&quot;
a part of the input like this to process separately?

Actually, I think I have a sick idea: Since this is line-based stuff,
and small files, I can read this all in to memory.  I can hand-parse
the shell command lines, and replace them with an empty line (to
preserve line numbers in case of error) in the input, noting which
lines I modified.  Then, I can give the massaged input to Antlr.  The
parser is going to produce one instance of a Command class for each
line, and return a list of them, in order.  I can just put the shell
Command instances back in the list where they belong and be on my
merry way..

As I said though, it would be really cool if I could just do this all
in Antlr.

Hooray!

You can use whatever tree type you want.  Set ASTLabelType I think as  
an option  in the grammar.

&gt;<i>    Also, if even if we use the tree parser, what should we do if we  
</I>&gt;<i> need more than one way to do the translation from of the same node  
</I>&gt;<i> (an expression node for example)?  Using more than one tree parser  
</I>&gt;<i> may be a little bit confusing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    for example, can we do this in the same grammar file
</I>&gt;<i>        subroutineName1=expression: ......... will be translated to  
</I>&gt;<i> subroutine named subroutineName1
</I>&gt;<i>        subroutineName2=expression: ......... will be translated to  
</I>&gt;<i> subroutine named subroutineName2
</I>
That differs by an ID...how are you differentiating them?

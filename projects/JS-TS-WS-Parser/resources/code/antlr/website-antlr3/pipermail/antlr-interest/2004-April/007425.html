<PRE>Hi - 

I work for these guys : www.boxtelematics.com, and they make a 
hardware unit that offers a scripting abilty.

So... anyway I figured that it would be nice to provide a nice IDE 
to develop the scripts in - one that looks for syntax errors etc, 
and one that I could look for logical errors in script design in.

Anyway - my first step has been to define a lexicon, describing all 
of the tokens (right terminology?) thant can be inputted in the 
stream - my idea is start small (say less than 10 commands) and add 
the rest in once the concept has been proved.

Anyway - here's my lexer grammar ...

protected NEWLINE
    :   '\r' '\n'   // DOS
    |   '\n'        // UNIX
    ;
BOXDALLASKEY				:		
	('0'..'9')+;
BOXaddkey					:		
	&quot;.addkey&quot;  			
	{System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;&lt;&lt;Lex :: .addkey&gt;&gt;&quot;);}; 
BOXalarm					:		
	&quot;.alarm&quot;  			
	{System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;&lt;&lt;Lex :: .alarm&gt;&gt;&quot;);}; 
BOXalive					:		
	&quot;.alive&quot;  			
	{System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;&lt;&lt;Lex :: .alive&gt;&gt;&quot;);}; 

at the moment i am just experimenting, so I have put the print lines 
there to prove it's all working.

to provide the main structure for the commands, the following parser 
grammar has been constructed :



 box_addkey		:			BOXaddkey 
BOXDALLASKEY NEWLINE		; 
 box_ai			:			BOXai 		
						;


ok - hopefully everyone's clear with that.  Anyway - what I wanted 
to do was to compile this little lot to give a lexer / parser that I 
could use in C#, to provide a gui to the user - and that 'seems' to 
have worked ok - however I am unsure if I am doing this right.  Does 
anyone have any advice regarding my structure here?  Can i get away 
with merely a lexer( I'm sort of thinking that I can - I'm only 
interested in returning valid tokens not interpreting them - am I 
missing something?)?  

Is there any documentation for the c# lexer and parsers?  


I'm using the eclipse IDE, and the ANTLR plugin (by the way - that 
doesn't seem to like compiling if language = CSHARP?  any ideas?)

Cheers guys -

<PRE>Thanks for the advice Monty. I think I'll use a custom AST then. I've
been following the examples and now have a good idea of how to do it
(C++ output).

It's about VHDL, and as I said before the idea is to represent the
source code (a hw digital design) in a hierarchical way. The tool down
the line will modify it, so some basic info must stored although we are
no making a VHDL compiler.
One of the simplest cases I came across so far (this one is not
difficult to solve):

In this case I am interested only on the source of context clause, which
has to be kept as list or vector of string (the tree has a method for
the input of the source code on a line basis). In more complex cases,
the call hierarchy would be deeper and, for example, I would have to
keep the source code as in this case but also individual items (going
back to the example I could be interested in having as well all the
IDENTIFIERs associated to logical_name_list because they would be needed
to invoke a tree construction method).
I hope this gives an idea of what I have to do. I don't post more
complex examples because it's already a pain for me to follow them in
the grammar even though I built the creature.

context_clause
	:  (context_item)*
	;

context_item
	:  library_clause
	|  use_clause
	;

library_clause
     	:  &quot;library&quot; logical_name_list SEMICOLON
     	;

logical_name_list 
   	:  ln1:logical_name (COMMA logical_name)*
	;

logical_name
	:  IDENTIFIER
	;

Would you still go for the custom AST option?

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [antlr-interest] Dilemma
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> 	I have an antlr recognizer already built. Now I am adding
</I>actions to
&gt;<i> produce the output, which is the generation of a tree (not an AST, it
</I>is a
&gt;<i> custom tree-structure representing the hierarchy of the source code).
</I>I
&gt;<i> decided to build the tree manually, mostly because I don't have
</I>control
&gt;<i> over
</I>&gt;<i> it, only access to the methods for creating it. From the input source
</I>code
&gt;<i> the important thing is to recognize some key structures which are the
</I>&gt;<i> inputs
</I>&gt;<i> to the tree construction methods, mainly names, numbers and portions
</I>of
&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> source code (in the form of strings).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	The dilemma I face is to find the simplest (performance not
</I>&gt;<i> critical) way to do this (the grammar has already some 2000 lines and
</I>over
&gt;<i> 200 rules). The basic problems I face are that the grammar decomposes
</I>a
&gt;<i> rule
</I>&gt;<i> (for which I have some tree construction method) into several levels
</I>of
&gt;<i> calls to other sub rules. Each sub rule will match some text (a name,
</I>a
&gt;<i> list
</I>&gt;<i> of names, or more complex structures) and then I have to return this
</I>info
&gt;<i> back to the main rule in some way. This is the key point. I have
</I>devised
&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;<i> far several ways of doing this (in each case with some limitations):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	1. Use rule return values. -&gt; Cumbersome when the sub rule is n
</I>&gt;<i> levels below. One possible return value; when in need to return
</I>multiple
&gt;<i> things they have to be grouped; manually done all the way
</I>&gt;<i> 	2. Use AST= true and take advantage of nodes' text as a sort of
</I>&gt;<i> antlr-managed string-type return value. -&gt; Limited to strings, still a
</I>bit
&gt;<i> cumbersome when sub rule is deep down in the call hierarchy, adds a
</I>lot of
&gt;<i> overhead.
</I>&gt;<i> 	3. Create some data members in the parser class or some
</I>automatic
&gt;<i> objects within the class' rules, and communicate through them. -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Difficult
</I>&gt;<i> to follow, I think it might be prone to hide bugs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	So far my ideas, right now I might be going for a combination of
</I>2
&gt;<i> and 3, but I am looking forward to learning from other people's
</I>experience
&gt;<i> and knowledge. Any help is appreciated,
</I>&gt;<i>

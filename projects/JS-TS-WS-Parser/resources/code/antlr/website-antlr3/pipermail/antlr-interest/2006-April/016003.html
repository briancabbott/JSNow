Hi Rob!  Ok, got the wiki started and added a v2 versus v3 page:

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/The+difference+between+ANTLR">http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/The+difference+between+ANTLR</A> 
+v2+and+v3

We need a migration page too.  I know lots of people have made some  
notes, let's start collecting them!

&gt;<i> I've seen that string template has it's own docs, so I suspect that  
</I>&gt;<i> once I get that far, I can use that for reference (and from what  
</I>&gt;<i> I've seen as examples so far, it looks pretty straight forward).
</I>
i should also have a paper out in draft form very shortly.

&gt;<i> (Q2) Once I've produced all the code (future task), how would I  
</I>&gt;<i> dump out my variable declarations? In the scope is there an &quot;@done&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> production where I can drop in some code to generate that output?  
</I>&gt;<i> (Or, quite possibly, a string template reference?)
</I>
You eventually call .toString on the outer most template. Just put an  
action somewhere to create that string and send it to a file.  There  
is an @finally {...}Action for rules that is executed when the rule  
exits if you want.

&gt;<i> (Q3) Also, when I'm in ANTLR Works, is there some way to work with  
</I>&gt;<i> a template (group) file?
</I>
Not yet. Jean Bovet and I are talking about this.

&gt;<i> I see the example for &quot;cminus&quot; uses multiple group templates, but  
</I>&gt;<i> there is a separate Java program setting that up. When I've started  
</I>&gt;<i> monkeying with templates, it starts looking for template files  
</I>&gt;<i> named after each individual template - but I couldn't figure out  
</I>&gt;<i> either where they need to be or what they should be named. I'm just  
</I>&gt;<i> trying to figure out where ANTLR Works stops and Eclipse begins...
</I>
you are specifically loading a template group files with a reader so  
you or specifying the location. Do not use the StringTempalteGroup   
constructors that do not tak a group file format.

&gt;<i> (Q4) I think I just need verification on this: Those productions  
</I>&gt;<i> that aren't in caps (invokes other productions maybe) return an  
</I>&gt;<i> object that has a String Template in the &quot;.st&quot; portion
</I>
the return  argument is called $st not &quot;.st&quot;.

&gt;<i> and the productions that are in CAPS (somewhat more in the constant  
</I>&gt;<i> realm) do not have String Templates, but they do have a &quot;.text&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> node that contains the value. What is returned and what is  
</I>&gt;<i> available on these nodes?
</I>
CAPS implies token. lowercase implies rule reference.

&gt;<i> (Q5) Oh yeah, on a purely not getting it scale, can I declare a  
</I>&gt;<i> global scope (this is assembly after all) and keep the  
</I>&gt;<i> initialization of the variables outside of the program declaration  
</I>&gt;<i> itself? I think it may be a tad bit cleaner. I tried something like  
</I>&gt;<i> the snippet below, but the global_scope itself (a Stack) never got  
</I>&gt;<i> initialized.  This was placed before the program production but  
</I>&gt;<i> after the options declaration.
</I>&gt;<i>     scope global {
</I>&gt;<i>         List variables;
</I>&gt;<i>     }
</I>&gt;<i>     @init {
</I>&gt;<i>         $global::variables = new ArrayList();
</I>&gt;<i>     }
</I>
  my recommendation is that you do not play with &quot;scopes&quot; until you  
really know what to doing. Using instance variables.

&gt;<i> (Q6) What the heck is channel 99? Are there others?
</I>
  all white spacecharacters are sent to the parser on a hidden  
channel so that the parser has them but does not parse them. It is  
like listening to a different radio channel.

&gt;<i> Shoot, as usual, this grew. Sorry and thanks in advance for your  
</I>&gt;<i> advice!
</I>
My pleasure.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi!

</I>&gt;<i> 2. assume we have r1 -&gt; X r2 Y and some more rules using the r2.
</I>&gt;<i>    after going to r1 and making r2 production my exected is FIRST(Y)
</I>&gt;<i>    which is subset of FOLLOW(r2).
</I>&gt;<i>    How can I know it before getting back to r1 from r2?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Regarding problem 1 I think I've solved the problem using $FIRST and
stack:

s -&gt; {push(FIRST(b), expect = FIRST(a)}
     a {pop(), push(FIRST(c), expect = FIRST(b)}
     b {pop(), push(EOF), expect = FIRST(c)}
     c

a -&gt; {expect = FIRST(a)}
     X {expect = FIRST(c) or top()}
    (c)*

and so on.

It seems to work good for k=1, but for k=2 it doesn't work, since
FIRST set is set of 1-length sequences of tokens.

As I understand from the group antlr 3.0 is going to be table based
and thus will provide some way to calculate the expect set.

When will it be released?

As for problem 2 - I'm still looking for advice.

&gt;<i> Problem 2:
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that backtracking here is bad idea because of actions 
</I>which
&gt;<i> have to be either undone or abandoned.
</I>&gt;<i> Is reparsing the whole sequence the only option?
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe &lt;wordback&gt; should be special unhandled token which will cause
</I>&gt;<i> an expception? But how then can I get back to the correct state?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you in advance,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nick
</I>
Sincerely,

Nick

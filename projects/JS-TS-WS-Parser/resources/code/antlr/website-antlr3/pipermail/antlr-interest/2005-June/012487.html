I find this box a bit strange, too, but given one gets used to it... at
least for accessibility reasons, you should, well, place more emphasis
on it. The line stroke is a bit thin/the color too bright for a white
background. It is also no good using color only to distinguish important
things like + and * for the same reason, IMO.

<PRE>Hi,

Are you saying that there isn't any source code for 3.0.1?  What is the
process by which the .dll is created? It sounds like some byte-code to IL
code conversion.  I'm asking from the point of view of support for bug
fixes.  Sounds like all the effort, rightly so, is going into 3.1, though
that would force us to drop support for .NET 1.1.  I'll check into the
latest beta/daily build and ping back if there are issues.

BTW, there is a way to sign after the fact.  

ildasm Antlr3.Runtime.dll /out:Antlr3.Runtime.il

ilasm Antlr3.Runtime.il /dll /res:Antlr3.Runtime.res /key:Spring.Net.snk
/out:Antlr3.Runtime.dll

Could you sign the current assemblies this way?

Cheers,
Mark

(3.0.1)

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We use Antlr quite heavily in an open source project, Spring.NET, and we
</I>&gt;<i> must sign all of our assemblies.  I want to update from 2.7 to 3.0.1 but
</I>&gt;<i> noticed that the assembly is not strongly signed.  In the past
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&lt;<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2006-January/015149.html">http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2006-January/015149.html</A>
&gt;<i> &gt; I was able to track down the source code and recompile myself but I
</I>&gt;<i> can't
</I>&gt;<i> locate the source for Antlr3.Runtime.dll now and it would of course be
</I>&gt;<i> better if it was done by the Antlr team.
</I>
The reason is that the only avaliable source was the reflactored source code
version. Even I as the new maintainer never had the original source code for
that. But while I can't help you there, 3.1 already includes strongnamed
assemblies - at least they should be strongnamed. Never tested that myself,
as I didn't create the build files. Look at the latest beta or daily build
for the current source code and assemblies.

Johannes
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is it possible to get a strongly signed 3.0.1 runtime dll?  If not, can it
</I>&gt;<i> be done for the 3.1 release?   I'm happy to lend a hand to help out and
</I>&gt;<i> even
</I>&gt;<i> compile myself, contribute back, if you can point me in the right
</I>&gt;<i> direction.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks again for the great software!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mark

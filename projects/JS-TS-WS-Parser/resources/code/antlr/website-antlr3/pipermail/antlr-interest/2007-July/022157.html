&gt;<i> Hi, Wincent
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have updated the version of FishEye on the server to the latest  
</I>&gt;<i> version and
</I>&gt;<i> this should resolve the problem in regard to the zip not including  
</I>&gt;<i> all files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you try again, and see how you get on.
</I>
Thanks for your attention to that. I'm sure I'm not the only one who  
appreciates this.

I performed some testing. The files which were missing from the  
archive are present now. I haven't done an exhaustive check to see if  
everything is present because it's a little difficult to compare (the  
official ANTLR distribution contains more than what's in FishEye;  
it's over 3MB whereas the stuff in FishEye yields an archive just  
under 2MB in size)... but at a glance it does appear that everything  
is there (at least &quot;ant build&quot; at the top level of the extracted  
archive works).

So both the tgz and zip archives now appear to be complete, although  
the tbz2 archive appears to be truncated:

$ tar -tjf antlr.tbz2

bzip2: Compressed file ends unexpectedly;
         perhaps it is corrupted?  *Possible* reason follows.
bzip2: Inappropriate ioctl for device
         Input file = (stdin), output file = (stdout)

It is possible that the compressed file(s) have become corrupted.
You can use the -tvv option to test integrity of such files.

You can use the `bzip2recover' program to attempt to recover
data from undamaged sections of corrupted files.

tar: Child returned status 2
tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors



Performance is still a bit of an issue. These were downloaded from  
FishEye:

- Downloaded over 3Mb ADSL connection:

10:22:43 (5.61 KB/s) - `antlr.tgz' saved [1928104]
10:28:13 (5.91 KB/s) - `antlr.tgz' saved [1928104]

04:22:32 (21.80 KB/s) - `antlr.tgz' saved [160730]

Compare that with downloading from the official ANTLR site (static  
archive served over HTTP):

11:00:22 (237.19 KB/s) - `antlr-3.0.tar.gz' saved [3257540/3257540]

Cheers,

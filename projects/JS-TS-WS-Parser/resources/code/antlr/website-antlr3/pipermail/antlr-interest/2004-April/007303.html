Understood. As I said to the poster of the previous VB-ish grammar,
&quot;please consider a less restrive license like the BSD&quot;.

If you feel that way, then you should.

</I>
No. Well, perhaps. &quot;No&quot; because I didn't know there was a parser. I
just couldn't understand how your lexer wasn't working hence my
request for input and messages.

&quot;Perhaps&quot; because, it a little difficult trying to help if I have no
idea of what's in your grammar. If the grammar needs to remain
confidential and you still need help, you should consider hiring a
skilled ANTLR/language design consultant. Just ask on the list.

</I>
Don't sound like not working to me. End of input maybe?. Unless you
meant to say it terminated abruptly (i.e. crashed, stack-tracked,
core-dump or similar).

Are you building an AST yet?. Look at the Java grammar sample - if you
are developing in C# or Java - for an example of how to display this
AST in an ASTFrame.

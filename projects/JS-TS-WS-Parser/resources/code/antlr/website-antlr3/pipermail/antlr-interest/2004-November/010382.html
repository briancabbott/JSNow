&gt;<i> And to add my tuppence-worth, speaking as an *engineer* (actually,
</I>&gt;<i> scientist by training), the computer mathematicians are making exactly
</I>&gt;<i> the same mistake as the hardware people, namely a belief in abstraction
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
Indeed.  What I was describing is a dichotomy.  Neither side is, a priori,
correct/right/true.


&gt;<i> Okay, I'm more into database theory, but you're talking about logic,
</I>&gt;<i> symbolism and abstraction - all branches of PURE mathematics. Where is
</I>&gt;<i> the *scientific* evidence that all this maths is *relevant* to problem in
</I>&gt;<i> hand (stuff like experiment, statistics, etc etc).
</I>
IMHO, both sides are better looked at as being tools in our kit to solving
the problem at hand.

[...]

&gt;<i> Sorry if I'm drifting way off topic, but I really get wound up when
</I>&gt;<i> people seek to justify their world view through mathematics. There's a
</I>&gt;<i> very big gulf between *correct* maths and *relevant* maths, and too many
</I>&gt;<i> people seem to think that just because it's the former, it has to be the
</I>&gt;<i> latter too. (Look at modern physics - we have many &quot;correct&quot; theories,
</I>&gt;<i> we're just trying to work out which ones are &quot;relevant&quot;.)
</I>
Indeed, that tiny issue of dealing with reality is something that the
software world has spent way too much time in denial about.

Thanks,

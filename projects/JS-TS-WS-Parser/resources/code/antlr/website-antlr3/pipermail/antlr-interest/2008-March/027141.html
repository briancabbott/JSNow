<PRE>Good points, Jim - and you're right, I have done no work on identifying time
spent lexing/parsing/generating - I just notice some log steps take longer
than others. Most of this is happening in memory, as I'm trying to do all
this as a Perl XS module (not wanting to fork JVM from Perl, which is awful
in almost every sense). I should probably better performance measurement,
and try a better string output - although as I said, I'm trying out an
event-based model which might well render all that obsolete.
 
Actually, the really slow bit (which I didn't include) is fixing up the
parse to actually handle C and C++ oddities and context-sensitivities. The
grammar itself is k=1 (except in two rules with k=2) with no backtracking,
and I'm not using any kind of treewalker. I probably should be, and it would
be a better solution, but it would further complicate the fact that I really
want some connection to the input text to be preserved. However, speed is
not an issue for me, really: if it took 10 times as long I'd still be happy,
if it kept the underlying text association, as at present I have to do the
annotation by parsing the text all over again. (Also, I was doing everything
until today on a vintage 1.5 GHz Pentium 4 - so  my newly arrived 4 core
machine should take care of a lot of speed-up.)
 
I don't think any vague performance comparison of an XML parser and ANTLR is
fair, for all sorts of reasons. XML is essentially tiny and designed to be
easy to parse (even on tiny devices) where with ANTLR (and XML schemas) it
is possible to construct grammatical monsters. I was just indicating that
considering core XML to be slower than ANTLR surprises me. If XML is not
faster, given a comparison of equivalent size/complexity input, then it
really should be (validation, schemas, URL-based entities, and DOM memory
management aside). I admit the size/complexity of (most) Java XML parsing
generally does surprise me, but small parsers for mobile devices will do
most XML in about 10k of basic (CLDC) Java source code. It is validation,
schemas, URL-based entities, and DOM than make XML slow, big, and nasty -
and to be honest, none of these are especially important to its core
purpose: marking up text. 
 
The scenario I flagged is illustrative only of my particular task, where I
want the best of an AST and of the text. This is not quite associating
comments and structure, but of generating annotated/formatted text. I was
just commenting that XML technologies can be very helpful for certain tasks
(like these) and that combining ANTLR and XML for tasks like these ought to
be easier than having to muck around at the text layer manually. I still
hope this is possible, but if not, I'll maybe have to think how to manage
the architecture better. 
 
All the best
Stuart

I would need to see your code to comment on why you feel that your XML
generator is 5X slower than libxml, but do bear in mind the following:

 

1)      ANTLR is for recognition of the things you specify via grammar, and
the xml library is hand crafted to go straight at internal structure, hence
it is likely using things like memchr to locate the next spot in the input
it is concerned with and so on. This isn't a defense of the C runtime by the
way, it should be obvious that when you know exactly what the input looks
like, you can hand craft something that will be faster than a generic
program;

2)      You are generating the XML after reading in and lexing, parsing ;-)
Hence it isn't quite a fair competition unless you are going to get libxml2
to do something equivalent J

3)      You might try the optimized scanning in the C runtime if you can
pre-know the input encoding is 8 or 16 bits (I will provide a UTF32 version
before too long). This skips calling a function to find the next input
character and instead maintains a pointer into the input stream. See the
Java parsing example in the downloads.

4)      If you are using the built in string stuff, then note that you don't
have to do that. It is generic and so when you ask for the text, it creates
some memory and so on. If you are in fact building up a long output string,
then you could easily write a function that given a pCOMMON_TOKEN, memcpy's
the input text directly where you want it to go. This is a big advantage in
ANTLR 3 as you are not forced into incurring penalties you do not need.
Otherwise you are probably asking for the $text of a token, which is going
to copy it from the input stream then appending it some buffer. There is no
need for the intermediate step.

5)      Make sure you are not using expensive predicates and backtracking of
course.

6)      If you want me to take a look, feel free to send me the code off
list.

 

So in short, I am sure that you can improve your performance quite a lot
(perhaps using a profiler will help you here), but you probably can't
compete with something that isn't really tokenizing anything if it is
written well. Loring is correct in his assessment of XML processors in
general though, according to my own experience, but that doesn't mean that
there are not some good ones around ;-)

 

My other thought here is that to accurately gauge a 5X performance with just
your own 'gut feel' you would have to be parsing an input stream that is
pretty huge. My own parsers don't take long enough for me to measure
anything with a single input stream, it is just 'done' almost as soon as it
is called in terms of human time spans. Are you by any chance traversing an
input directory, where you must read the file from the filesystem, but then
calling libxml2 with an in memory string? You might try breaking out the
time for each component. For instance, when testing the C runtime against
the Java runtime, I was parsing the whole of JDK 1.6. In the end, the time
taken to get the files off disk was more than the parsing and until I found
a way to remove this as a bottle neck, the C parser was only looking about
50% faster as most of the time was reading from the file system for both
Java and C. 

 

 I will point out that while associating comments with code seems to be an
easy task, you soon find out that it is almost impossible to get all the
associations correct unless you are starting out with some pre-canned rules
for what you are going to see, such as how doxygen works. There is a lot of
information on this stuff elsewhere of course.

 

Anyway, I am happy to hear you have been successful building your
parser/toolset!

 

Jim

Yep, I see this, and I'm certainly no fan of XML from a user's perspective.
I agree 110% with the rant. XML is not written for humans, nor should people
have to read/write it. I have ranted myself against the semantic web
community in much the same (they seem to imagine people can write not only
XML, but RDF!!) But as a way of annotating text flexibly, I can't see much
wrong with it. And I can't see why a parse tree of some kind (ideally with
lexing information) at the least cannot be overlaid on the text in this
manner. I suppose the question is: do you need to maintain association with
the underlying text? If not, an AST is fine. If so, why not use a flexible
text markup language. The comment issue seems (to me) to fit into the
category of maintaining association with the underlying text. And it is not
that hard - as far as I can tell, ANTLR could be made to do it just fine in
a couple of hundred lines of code, in the tree writer. 

 

Performance doesn't seem to match what I've been getting. I can slurp in
immense amounts of XML fast using libxml2 - this is certainly (subjectively)
quicker than parsing using ANTLR and the C runtime. However, I did choose
libxml2 carefully (I led a project on the INEX XML information retrieval
competition, and needed something capable of large-scale fast XML, as we
were indexing the whole of Wikipedia). I've not benchmarked it, but my C
parser feels about 5 times slower than reading the XML I generate from its
back end. 

 

It is the &quot;horizontal problems&quot; I'm actually working on, trying to integrate
information from multiple interlocking source languages, many of which are
(a) sloppily defined (C, C++, COBOL:, etc.) and (b) which embed each other
in all sorts of interesting ways. This includes not only obvious stuff
(&lt;script&gt; in HTML) but far less obvious ones - C strings that happen to be
SQL queries. It is as if everything can be delegated (the obvious solution)
- but this raises the interesting challenge of how to make sense of stuff
that comes from multiple source languages, even within a single processing
unit. However, if a group of people have written fast code for searching
trees for patterns (this is not walking the tree, but searching it) this is
useful technology to me. As an ex-IR person maybe my roots in the XML
community are making me see things differently. 

 

It may be that the task I am trying to solve involves a weak version of a
grammar. Quite simply, I do not need to parse everything. I do need to
tokenise everything, in some form, but rarely do I need a complete tree.
With some languages (C, C++, COBOL:, etc.) parsing is a big enough challenge
on its own that I'd rather not bother. For the processing I am doing, I do
not care about control structures, for example. The C parser I developed
(successfully in ANTLR) is skeletal to the point of not classifying most
statements, but tracks nesting of parentheses, braces, etc. 

 

XML does not equate to making huge files out of things. SAX is a perfectly
good way of producing output, and being stream/event oriented, is great for
filtering tasks. The design I've been playing with is a generic
event-stream-oriented approach to parsing. That way I can (and do) stuff
gigabytes of text into the parsing systems without actually writing them
into files. 

 

Consider the following scenario. Imagine I want to annotate C into HTML,
making function calls into hyperlinks, and maybe a few other things, such as
colorising comments. Two tasks: recognising function calls, and annotating
the original text. To do this, the original text needs to be preserved, and
the text parsed in some way. This feels like a non-trivial task, but surely
it is not that unusual. It feels to me that an XML parse tree annotation on
the original text would make this a trivial task, for what ought to be a
modest additional to ANTLR. Obviously, if you felt strongly you could do it
directly, but there are good (separation of concerns) reasons for not
tangling the styling details into the parser, and XML would allow this kind
of separation. 

 

All the best

Stuart

You can do XML and DOM--ANTLR 2 had an AST serializer built in--but there is
not much point to doing so other than that you have some familiarity with
the tools.  For any vertical translation problem (one language to
translate), ANTLR will be faster (XML processing is _slow_ from a machine
perspective), more powerful, and easier to use if you learn how to use ANTLR
effectively.  There are horizontal problems--extracting information from a
collection of trees generated by different source languages and different
translators--for which XML is usable, but again this is not the way to go if
you are comfortable with language processing technology.

The value of XML is that it is an agreed upon format for structured text
that is portable and can be adapted for general information retrieval (&quot;the
semantic web&quot;)--or at least has that as a hoped for goal.  It is not a
technology for language processing; indeed, the XML community seems to be
almost allergic to language processing technology.  &quot;Everything is a  tree&quot;
does not remove the need for grammars--the XML community calls them &quot;schema&quot;
and writes applications in XSLT to convert from one schema to another
without intermediate analysis.

You might also take a look at Ter's rant on XML,

<PRE>Hi,

Yah but planning ahead on non implemented languages seems a bit overdone.
At least I still have no clue what variables you mean exactly. And if
patching should be done in something else than input files for the
examples.

&gt;<i> I am happy for someone to just change the affected shared example

</I>
Think that shared is a big word in the context of the examples. Most of the
examples are quite incompatible between Java/C++. Maybe it's better for
Java/C# ?

&gt;<i> (who keeps tracks of changes in the examples accross languages?).
</I>
The language maintainers might port changes done in examples. In a very
rare case someone posts a patch for all examples. In general nobody keeps
track of this stuff. At least I noticed no such activity since starting to
work on antlr.

Easiest is to just make the changes for the C# dir I guess.

Cheers,

Ric

I too am quite interested in this topic -- but have been diverted away
from it for quite some time.

I think the key here is defining the meta-notation for describing the
semantic analysis to be performed. It would seem that in defining the
meta-notation you might just end up with yet another programming
language.....

Altho some researchers appear to have obtained some interesting results.
Google for &quot;action semantics&quot; and &quot;asf+sdf&quot; and i am sure there are
others along those lines.... You might try also googling &quot;suif&quot; and/or
&quot;llvm&quot; but these last two seem to be more related to the code generation
phase rather than the analysis phase.

I quite like the Post system notation that Benjamin Pierce uses in his
book &quot;Types and Programming Languages&quot;, MIT Press, 2002, ISBN
0-262-16209-1

Hope this helps

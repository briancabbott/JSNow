Oh, I was talking about the case where I don't have any bangs in the  
rule. But from entering the rule I cannot look forward onto all the  
atoms within
the rule, can I? (Or rather, the tree walker isn't doing that.)
So in the general case without any bangs, I don't want to create any  
string. I want to rely on the indices into the input buffer.

</I>
As straightforward as possible ;) The first thing that should would  
work are the literals, I agree. The rest should be quite similar,  
though.

<PRE>@Kevin - thanks for the reply:
&gt;<i>Why can't ' ' be a part of either OTHERCHARS or STRCHAR?  Then you don't
</I>need the syntactic predicate in your STRING_LITERAL rule....
I don't see your rule for handling the &quot; characters.
If you are worried about strings containing NLs or TABs (which would be
errors), then you might want your STRING_LITERAL rule to check for them
(in a semantic predicate instead and explicitly disallow them) instead
of trying to allow blanks.

** I tried making the blank part of OTHERCHARS or STRCHAR; that didn't work for me, either. Perhaps I'm running into the interpreter problems John mentioned.

&gt;<i> Ouch, your not going to try and parse:
</I>
&quot;identifier =two words&quot;

as if it was

identifier =&quot;two parts&quot; are you??

** No, I'm not! There are actually 2 different cases. More fully:

..., keywordOne=&quot;id1=uservalue&quot; | &quot;id2= two words&quot;, keywordTwo=&quot; a bunch of words here. maybe spaces maybe not&quot;

This is just part of a more complicated grammar, with nested structures separated by curly brackets, lists separated by vertical bars, and more. I didn't include the whole grammar showing the handling of the quotation marks.
</PRE>

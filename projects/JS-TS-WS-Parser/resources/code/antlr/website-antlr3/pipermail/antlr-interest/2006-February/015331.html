If there are no bangs lexically present in the rule, don't generate  
the special code. :)

Yep.  Only do new stuff if you see a !.  Even if it's in a (..)? block.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Just recording the indices and copy to buffer once I see a bang  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and pick up after that was the first idea I had...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I could probably set some flag if I've seen a bang and only then  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> really copy the buffer. Yeah, that might work...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> True, but messier I suppose.  Perhaps we should think about the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> literals...how complicated do you want the average case to be...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As straightforward as possible ;) The first thing that should would

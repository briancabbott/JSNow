<PRE>All,

I used ANTLR 2.7 in the past and I consider using ANTLR 3.0 for a new 
project.

However, it is very difficult to find relevant information on ANTLR 3.0. 
I noticed the new ANTLR 3 wiki but it seems to be rather incomplete. For 
instance, &quot;fragment&quot; is not listed as a rule option.

May I assume that the 2.7 documentation still applies unless the 3.0 
documentation states the opposite? Concretely, I wondering whether the 
error handling is the same in 2.7 and 3.0 (exception hierarchy, parser 
exception handlers, defaultErrorHandler, ...). The wiki says nothing 
about this topic. Why don't you use the 2.7 documentation as a starting 
point and modify it where needed?

All in all I think that the ANTLR web site is too complicated. The 
average user is confronted with so many different things of varying 
importance (just count the links on the home page!) that (s)he doesn't 
know where to start. It reminds me of the Eclispe web site which is also 
concerned with so many things that the guys forgot to announce version 
3.2.1 on their home page.

Please don't take my comments personally. ANTLR is a great tool and I 
love it! Just make it simpler to understand its concepts!

Kind regards,

Michael Gerz (formerly known as Michael Schmitt)

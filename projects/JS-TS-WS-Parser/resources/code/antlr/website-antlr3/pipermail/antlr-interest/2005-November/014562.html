<PRE>&gt;<i> Don't give up.  You're very close to groking ANTLR.  I think you tried
</I>&gt;<i> to merge what several people suggested, but there were not really
</I>&gt;<i> meant to work together.  They were more ideas bouncing around.
</I>
Not a problem - I'm finding the syntax confusing, which is ironic
since I'm working on writing an expression parser and a compiler,
isn't it? If you've been following my questions, I've got a project at
home to do a BASIC compiler, and we think having a good expression
parser at work will really allow us to enhance our product (my
&quot;lunchtime&quot; projects sometimes get carried away). I've then created a
simpler version of the expression parser at home to work out issues
(evaluates to doubles; the one at work is capable of handling Doubles,
Dates, Booleans, and Strings), plus the little sideline ones for WTF
resolution.  I'm confused myself - I have at least 4 grammars going
right now.  :-|

&gt;<i> If you are lost, then we failed in our attempt to assimilate you into
</I>&gt;<i> the uber-ANTLR collective, and we must try again :-)
</I>
I think part of it is that my single compiler course was between 1988
and 1990, so that's 15 years ago. I've forgotton a lot, plus I've
never used lex or yacc (or bison or flex or ...) so the terminology
and capabilities are a mystery. I've got the Dragon Book, but that's
all I have for resources and I've only spot-checked stuff since my
compiler class.

&gt;<i> The lexer appears okay (even to the &quot;evil DOS&quot; comment!).
</I>
That was stolen from an example I read, so I can take no credit.

&gt;<i> The parser and the tree parser both look &quot;correct&quot;, but they don't
</I>&gt;<i> play well together.
</I>
You may have hit the nail on the head. When I'm working on this, I'm
not thinking of the AST created. From what you're saying, that's
something I better try to pay attention to... and maybe why I've
gotten lost on the argument list - I may need pictures (or verbal
descriptions of them).

&gt;<i> The parser you have written... (snip)
</I>
The good news is that with your suggestions, my simple expression
parser WORKS now. I'm not actually performing any functions, but I'm
getting output for the arguments before I see that the function is
being evaluated.

Let me walk the AST for the functions...

(1) In the parser, &quot;IDENTIFIER LPAREN^ argList RPAREN!&quot; instructs
ANTLR to build an AST with LPAREN (literally &quot;(&quot;) as the root node.
This becomes my &quot;key&quot; to seeing the function call. IDENTIFIER becomes
the first child and argList is the second child.

(2) Still in the parser, for argList, &quot;expression (COMMA! expression)*
{ ## = #( #[ARGLIST,&quot;ARGLIST&quot;], ## ); }&quot; requires one expression
optionally followed by additional expressions separated by commas. The
comma is not stored in the AST.

I *think*, after re-reading this thread, that &quot;##&quot; stuff creates one
AST tree with &quot;ARGLIST&quot; as the root and each expression being appended
as a child... ?  I think this is instead of having multiple
parent-children structures?

Ok, I cannot figure out what it would look like without the ARGLIST
building stuff. I'd have &quot;(&quot; as the parent, first child would be
IDENTIFIER, and then... additional children with expression? Which
wouldn't be a problem, except I have no way to match the argument list
in the tree parser??

(3) In the tree parser, the expression rule, &quot;#(LPAREN i:IDENTIFIER
args:argList) { System.out.println(&quot;i=&quot; + i + &quot;, args=&quot; + args); }&quot; is
sort of a regex expression to match the AST created by (1). &quot;i&quot; and
&quot;args&quot; are just AST trees. &quot;i&quot; is useful because that gives me the
function name, but &quot;args&quot; is worthless - right? It's just an AST
without any of the evaluated values. I need to track those in the
argList rule.

(4) Finally, in the tree parser,

argList
{ double v; }
	:	#( ARGLIST
			(
				v=expression
				{
					System.out.println(&quot;expression = &quot; + v);
				}
			)*
  		)
  	;

This mess matches the fake token &quot;ARGLIST&quot; and then forces the
argument expressions to be evaluated. &quot;v&quot;, in this case, is a double.
I think I need to create a List somewhere and start collecting the
value which the function call would reference and then clear up.

----

Close?

I hope so... 'cause then I'll have more questions, but I think this is
plenty enough for you kind souls to answer!!! Plus I don't want to go
too far overboard...

Thanks!
-Rob

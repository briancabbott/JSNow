&gt;<i> And in the name of all that's holy, please don't bring in angle 
</I>&gt;<i> brackets!  What's next, dollar signs and percents?  :-).
</I>
rule
 scope { String fred }
 : blah blah bl=blah

   {    $rule::fred = $bl.toString() }
 ;

Too late to object to dollars! Now, what should % be used for?...

Actually I wonder about the option of making a verbose and a symbolic
syntax. Most people look at things akin: {fred} ##&lt;$&gt;&gt;&lt;1&gt;//!!%

And go &quot;huh?&quot;, whereas once you are familiar with the symbols it is
easy. If there were more wordy forms like (sorry, couldn't resist the %
here ;-)):

%synpred   [ ]
%rulepred  [ ]
%hoistpred [ ]
%gatepred  [ ]

And so on, it might be useful for people new to the stuff, though I
don't suggest this being the only form.

However, the hash/pound symbol # looks to me very much like a gate,
otherwise it means NOT in a lot of languages I have to work with. 

Optional rules being [ ] depends on what language manual you are looking
at of course. A lot of manuals seem to use {}:

CRT {Identifier}

- Identifier is optional

And use [] for &quot;one of&quot;:

WRITE [Identifier | Expression] {:}


I think that once the symbols are settled upon that people will soon
forget the ANTLR 2 syntax (which could of course be a bit of a problem
when you go back to look at ANTLR 2 grammars). 

I think then that the best thing to do is be mindful of &quot;syntaxes which
have gone before&quot; but in the main to concentrate on making the ANTLR3
syntax as logical as possible.

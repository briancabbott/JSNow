<PRE>Hi Subhobroto,

 

I have been trying to achieve the same thing for some time now.

I was advised a week or two ago to drop the TreeParser and just parse the
expressions using a standard grammar parser without the tree.

 

I think using trees is a better approach, because you are able to walk the
parsed tree using several different tree parsers that process the grammar in
different ways. This is often quite useful.

 

I have been struggling for a while to get the tree correct.

I will send you my whole grammar, although it does not use a tree.

 

Regards

Craig.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Walking AST, and rule dilemma

 

  
I want to walk exprs. like &quot;a = 5 + b&quot; [AST : ( = a ( + 5 b ) )], using
something like :

          #(PLUS in2:INT statement)
          {
               show(&quot;;add to it '&quot; + in2-&gt;getText() + &quot;'&quot;);
          }

but I have a rule #(PLUS id2:ID statement) is already defined [ID :
('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'|'_') ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'|'_'|'0'..'9')*; INT :
('0'..'9')+]

The later rule matches exprs. like &quot;a = b + 5&quot; - but it's obvious that this
rule will not match the first expression. If I would have tried to
incorporate both rules, it would be a non-deterministic rule

What do I do ?

Also, how do I handle exprs. like &quot;a = b&quot; ?
For example, if such exprs. are encountered, I would like to print &quot;'b' is
assigned to 'a'&quot;

The complete ANTLR grammar containing these rules is available at
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/subhobrotosinha/novel.txt">http://www.geocities.com/subhobrotosinha/novel.txt</A>
The driver (C++) is available at
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/subhobrotosinha/noveldriver.txt">http://www.geocities.com/subhobrotosinha/noveldriver.txt</A>

It should be obvious that I have been using ANTLR seriously for the last 6
hours, so PLEASE make comments regarding my approach and code, even if you
cannot help me out re. this topic.

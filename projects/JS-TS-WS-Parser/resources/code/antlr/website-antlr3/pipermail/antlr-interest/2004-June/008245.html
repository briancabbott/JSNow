<PRE>I've looked at the example and it does make sense. Also I've not tried it yet but I see where your re-write below is going and will let you know how it goes.
 
Many thanks,
 
Craig

	Actually, following up to myself, you can probably just forget about the setlen/getlen stuff and say AMP!

	Okay. First things first - you NEED to look up that ESC example in the manual I gave you. But now let's try to rewrite your rule.
	 
	
	STRING_LITERAL
	// string literals - the only token that can be split with an '&amp;'.
	options {paraphrase = &quot;a string&quot;;}
	 : '&quot;'! (AMP{token.setlen(token.getlen()-3);}|{greedy=false;}.)* '&quot;'!
	 ;
	 
	What this is doing is first it finds your &quot; to start the string. Then it looks for either an AMP, or anything that doesn't match your final &quot; (that's the point of the &quot;greedy = false&quot; - the . won't eat any token that matches the following token-match). And when it finds an AMP, the setlen/getlen deletes it from the STRING_LITERAL that it's building.
	 
	This probably won't compile straight off - I've almost certainly got my cases wrong, and there's probably other minor faults. But I hope I've explained clearly what it's doing, and you should be able easily to clean it up.
	 
	Cheers,
	Wol

	Hi Anthony,
	 
	Thanks for your input to this, it's been doing my head in!
	 
	Indeed, I've got the following worked out so far:

	options {
	 exportVocab=PVocab;
	 k=3;
	filter=AMP;
	}
	 
	protected
	AMP
	//an &amp; and line break.
	 :  '&amp;' '\r' '\n' {System.out.println(&quot;&amp; HIT!&quot;);newline();}
	 ; 
	 
	STRING_LITERAL
	// string literals - the only token that can be split with an '&amp;'.
	options {paraphrase = &quot;a string&quot;;}
	 : '&quot;'! (~('&quot;'))* '&quot;'!
	 ;
	 
	This solves the first problem very well but the second point is that I still want the STRING_LITERAL token to be passed as one token, even when it's been split over 2 or more lines.
	 
	ie:
	 
	getrec(tag,&quot;select * from acct,x__ir &amp;
	where acct001 = x__ir001 and &amp;
	x__ir006 = 'V'&quot;)
	 
	Effectively I need the 3 lines of strings to be treated as 1 single STRING_LITERAL token, eg:
	 
	getrec(tag,&quot;select * from acct,x__ir where acct001 = x__ir001 and x_ir006 = 'V'&quot;)
	 
	and unfortuately shaving the last 3 characters wouldn't always work.
	 
	Again many thanks for your help,
	 
	Cheers
	 
	Craig

You can  ask Jim Idle about that, but we decided to use methods for  
setting the text rather than implementing ! which makes everything  
inefficient. I could swear there was something in the documentation.

&gt;<i> On an only-slightly-related note, I was also wondering what's the

</I>&gt;<i> literally, not as escapes, and another context (anywhere else)  
</I>&gt;<i> where they should be used as an escape sequence.  And again,  
</I>&gt;<i> ideally I want the resulting token to contain the 'real' string  
</I>&gt;<i> (ie. after escapes had been acted on).  Is this even possible?  (I  
</I>&gt;<i> imagine you could do it by treating it as an island grammar.  But  
</I>&gt;<i> that seems a little heavyweight.)
</I>
Easy enough, just match \  with a rule called FILENAME after '#include'.

&gt;<i>  And to be honest, there's no &quot;official&quot;

</I>
I presume you mean support for &quot;using the ANTLR C++ code generator and
runtime library with MSVC++ on Windows&quot;. If so, all I can say is that
the support has gotten much better since 2.7.4 was released (Ric now
has MS's compiler I believe). There has been a lot of useful
discussion on this list about ANTLR/C++ on Windows.

&gt;<i> &gt; Given developers with the same level of proficiency and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; experience with C++ and Java, most will be able to produce an 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; application like ANTLR much more quickly and easily with Java 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than C++. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, with all due respect I'm not sure how you can make that assertion.
</I>
I based it on my experience, that of many colleagues and employers
(past and present) and, on the findings of quite a few published
studies including:

&gt;<i> IMO, it depends to a large degree on the individual programmer.
</I>
Yes, productivity is generally more affected by individual programmer
skill than choice of implementation language.

&gt;<i> If any
</I>&gt;<i> particular language was significantly easier to use, everyone would
</I>be using
&gt;<i> it.
</I>
True. Of course no language is best at *everything* so we still get to
cherry pick...

&gt;<i> In any case, this is a philosophical issue on which we may simply
</I>&gt;<i> disagree.
</I>
Not really. Productivity can be measured.

&gt;<i> &gt;           There are of course some applications where the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need to optimize memory usage and/or speed aggressively 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suggest C++ (or perhaps C or assembly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; language) might be a better choice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, like parsers &lt;g&gt;.  In a debug build, it takes my
</I>antlr-generated (C++)
&gt;<i> parser about 15 seconds to parse a 77k source file.  With full
</I>optimizations
&gt;<i> enabled, the same code finishes in slightly under 2 seconds.  I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> kidding.  I was sweating bullets when got my parser to work and
</I>found it was
&gt;<i> so slow.
</I>
There are some efficiency issues with ANTLR lexers (especially if you
use the more advanced ANTLR lexer options) which ANTLR3 should fix.
The distribution has a sample showing how to couple Flex lexers to
ANTLR parsers. Search the list for past discussions.

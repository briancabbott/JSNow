<PRE>I believe 'transform' is a common term for this action in other circles.

Subject: [antlr-interest] we need a name for a new rewriting tool

Hi, Leon Su, the maniac that brings you gUnit is currently working  
with me on a rewrite system similar to other rewrite engines such as  
ASF+SDF, Stratego, TXL etc...  I believe the tool is in line with the  
strategy championed by Andy Tripp.

You'll be able to say things like &quot;whenever you see x+0 in an IF  
expression, rewrite it to x&quot;:

---------------------
rewrite Java; // applies rewrite rules to external java grammar
tokens {
	x=ID;
}

[ifstat ... expr]:
	&quot;x+0&quot; -&gt; &quot;x&quot;
	&quot;0+x&quot; -&gt; &quot;x&quot;
	...
---------------------

It is going to be extremely cool and will also work for tree rewrites.

The only problem we have is that we don't know what to call it. I  
originally had a nice tree rewriting system called Sorcerer (14 years  
ago) but now there are things like sourcerer and so on. can anybody  
help us name this tool?

THesaurus entries:

rewrite: revise, recast,reword, rephrase, redraft.

transform: change, alter,convert, metamorphose, transfigure,  
transmute, mutate; revolutionize,overhaul; remodel, reshape, redo,  
reconstruct, rebuild, reorganize, rearrange,rework, renew, revamp,  
remake, retool, transmogrify, morph

rebuild: reconstruct, renovate, restore, remodel, remake,reassemble.

Do any of those words help us?

I think &quot;morph&quot; is actually not bad.  Morpheme sounds cooler but makes  
less sense.  Morphica?  Morphic?  Morphologic? Morphomatic? ha! that  
one is funny.

How about metamorph? I like that one! google search only reveals a  
molecular device and some stupid school has taken metamorph.org. I  
guess that is no big deal because we will be using the antlr.org  
website for that.

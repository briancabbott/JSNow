I suppose 1.6 megabytes is pretty big for a Java source file and the 
odds are good that once compiled the resulting class file will exceed 
the limits of the JVM itself.

On the other hand, other editors, Vim e.g., easily handle files far 
larger than this! Of course, such editors don't need to build such a 
complex model of the file it's editing.


&gt;<i>   I am not sometimes able to see the code for parser on the screen

</I>&gt;<i>   How can I deal with this?

Now we get to the question of whether ANTLR is the proper tool to use to 
produce a URI parser. Still, there are always better and worse ways to 
craft a concrete grammar specification that captures a given 
specification.

Is your ANTLR grammar something you could disclose to us, or is it 
proprietary? If others with more experience than you (or me) could look 
at it, they might be able to suggest ways to pare down the size of the 
resulting parser code.

OK. I'll have a quick look at how C++ does this. Was this feature 
already present in 2.7.2a2 or should I be looking at 2.7.2a4 only?

I guess I was worried about situations such as:

1. the nodes have direct or indirect links (via object reference 
chains) to really big object graphs such as the symbol table.

2. the nodes have bidirectional links - i.e. parent&lt;-&gt;child and 
sibling1&lt;-&gt;sibling2..&lt;-&gt;..siblingN - that will effectively turn every 
dup()/dupXXX() into a full tree copy.

It's a worry that the use of these methods will incur a severe 
memory/space cost essentially. A deep clone would always deep copy 
all such linked objects too. 

&gt;&gt;<i>From our initial investigations, it seems that implementing deep 
</I>cloning semantics will have to be an all or nothing proposition in C# 
else the level of support needed in *all* classes becomes a real 
headache.

<PRE>I am handling &quot;include files&quot; in my lexer, as in the java example 
provided with antlr.  This means that fact the lexer is in an 
included file is transparent to the parser.

However, it turns out that I want the parser to be made aware of the 
fact that the lexer is in an included file. (Kindly assume that I 
have a sound design reason for this ;-) Given the amount of lookahead 
that may occur, I am sure that the only safe way to do this is by 
putting the correct &quot;notification&quot; on the stream of tokens passed to 
the parser.

Is it possible to have the lexer pass a back a &quot;bad&quot; token (i.e. one 
that the parser can never recognize), catch a resultant exception, 
and then (here's the important part) force the parser to take up 
right where is was when it got the &quot;bad&quot; token?  It would amount to 
skipping over the &quot;bad&quot; token, except that the exception handling 
code would set a flag or two that would be available later to parser 
semantic actions.

I have looked at the exception handling documentation, and sifted 
through my generated parser.  It is not clear to me if my strategy 
will work.

BTW, I am still using antlr 2.7.1 - I want to try to finish what I am 
doing before trying the switch to 2.7.2.

Thanks.

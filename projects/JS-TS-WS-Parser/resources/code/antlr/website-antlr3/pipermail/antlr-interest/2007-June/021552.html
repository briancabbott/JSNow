<PRE>Have you looked into Tidy <A HREF="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">http://tidy.sourceforge.net/</A>
and JTidy <A HREF="http://jtidy.sourceforge.net/">http://jtidy.sourceforge.net/</A>   ?

I'd start with one of these and keep going.
Doesn't sound like ANTLR is the right tool for this.

&gt;<i> One of the many translation tasks I'd like to use ANTLR for is 
</I>&gt;<i> translating wikitext to HTML. Two things make this quite difficult:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The translator has to be extremely tolerant of malformed input 
</I>&gt;<i> (users may not understand the wikitext syntax or may deliberately 
</I>&gt;<i> subvert it) and make reasonable &quot;cleanup&quot; attempts for bad input (such 
</I>&gt;<i> as closing tags that were left open by the user).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Wikitext structure is not unlike HTML structure, which means it is 
</I>&gt;<i> highly recursive and is very sensitive to nesting and ordering issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This means that the translator must be able to handle things like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - improperly interleaved tags: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - missing closing tags: &lt;em&gt;foo
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - missing opening tags: foo&lt;/em&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - mismatched tags (really just a combination of the above): 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;em&gt;foo&lt;/strong&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And it must enforce scoping rules that can be quite complicated at 
</I>&gt;<i> times; for example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - an &lt;em&gt; span may appear inside a &lt;strong&gt; span;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - and a &lt;strong&gt; span may appear inside an &lt;em&gt; span;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - but an &lt;em&gt; span may not appear inside an &lt;em&gt; span, so both 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;foo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;foo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are 
</I>&gt;<i> invalid
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - a &lt;blockquote&gt; may contain other block level elements such as &lt;p&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> and even another &lt;blockquote&gt;;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - but &lt;p&gt; may not contain &lt;blockquote&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - etc, etc, etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if it weren't for the fact that the translator has to gracefully 
</I>&gt;<i> handle bad input the task would be significantly easier. In other 
</I>&gt;<i> words, if ANTLR could assume that all input were perfectly formed and 
</I>&gt;<i> just throw errors on encountering bad input then it wouldn't be too 
</I>&gt;<i> hard. But even assuming syntactically perfect input there is still the 
</I>&gt;<i> issue of the complicated scoping rules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My first na&#239;ve attempt at doing this had me trying to express scope 
</I>&gt;<i> restrictions using only standard parser rules, but I very quickly got 
</I>&gt;<i> into trouble with recursion due to non-LL(*) decisions and 
</I>&gt;<i> non-determinisms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I then tried using predicates combined with a stack stored in a 
</I>&gt;<i> global scope. Basically, on entering a new rule, information would be 
</I>&gt;<i> pushed onto the stack describing what tags were explicitly allowed and 
</I>&gt;<i> what tags explicitly disallowed. Semantic predicates could then be 
</I>&gt;<i> used in subsequent rules to check the stack to see if a particular 
</I>&gt;<i> alternative to match.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, on entering a &lt;blockquote&gt;, the list of allowed tags is 
</I>&gt;<i> basically any block-level tag (&lt;p&gt;, &lt;blockquote&gt; etc) so those are 
</I>&gt;<i> pushed as a list onto the stack. On entering a &lt;p&gt;, the list of 
</I>&gt;<i> allowed tags is basically any inline element (&lt;em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt; etc). The 
</I>&gt;<i> predicate's job is then basically to walk the stack and confirm that 
</I>&gt;<i> (a) a given tag is explicitly allowed, and (b) it is not explicitly 
</I>&gt;<i> disallowed in any previous level of the stack.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I soon found that the predicates were being hoisted/lowered into 
</I>&gt;<i> unexpected places which prevented that idea from working. Perhaps 
</I>&gt;<i> someone with more intimate knowledge of how ANTLR does this would be 
</I>&gt;<i> able to make the solution work, but I didn't see much hope of getting 
</I>&gt;<i> it to work so I abandoned it. I also wasn't even sure that my stack of 
</I>&gt;<i> allowed/disallowed tags was a good design, even in the abstract sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So finally, the thing I'm doing is jettisoning the parser entirely and 
</I>&gt;<i> doing absolutely everything in the lexer. Ok, not exactly: I've made 
</I>&gt;<i> an extremely simple filtering lexer which has no predicates, no 
</I>&gt;<i> actions, just spits out tokens and has a catch-all rule at the bottom 
</I>&gt;<i> so that all input characters are guaranteed to come out as tokens on 
</I>&gt;<i> the other end.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then in my support code I ask the lexer for tokens one at a time and 
</I>&gt;<i> perform translation &quot;by hand&quot;. Once again I maintain a stack, but this 
</I>&gt;<i> time a slightly simpler one. Instead of maintaining a list of allowed 
</I>&gt;<i> and disallowed tags at each level I instead maintain a stack which 
</I>&gt;<i> indicates my current scope, kind of like a CSS selector: ie. if I've 
</I>&gt;<i> previously seen &lt;blockquote&gt;, &lt;p&gt; and &lt;em&gt; then my stack contains 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;blockquote&quot;, &quot;p&quot; and &quot;em&quot;; if I see another &quot;&lt;em&gt;&quot; I know I can't 
</I>&gt;<i> match it because that's already on the stack, and on seeing &quot;&lt;/em&gt;&quot; I 
</I>&gt;<i> pop it off the stack. In this way I can basically ignore unexpected 
</I>&gt;<i> tags (well, actually I output them literally as &quot;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&quot; etc) and 
</I>&gt;<i> insert missing tags when I think I should have seen them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of this manually management is a bit of effort, but it does work 
</I>&gt;<i> and that's very important: the code is simple enough to look at and 
</I>&gt;<i> see that it will work. If I tried to do all of this in ANTLR then 
</I>&gt;<i> there would be an element of black magic; I'd never feel sure that I 
</I>&gt;<i> knew what ANTLR was really doing behind the scenes. But I am left with 
</I>&gt;<i> the lingering doubt that I might not be doing things the best way. Do 
</I>&gt;<i> you think that this lexer-only-plus-supporting-code approach is the 
</I>&gt;<i> using the right tool for the job? Or am I missing something obvious?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Wincent

</I>I think that it is unlikely that you need to do this as some of the 
reasons that you would do this in bison are not limitations in ANTLR. 
For parsing you only need a token type and then access to the text that 
this represents, then you may or may not require a custom token type for 
an AST node for your tree.

So, you can change token types in the lexer by looking ahead in the 
character stream and making decisions on what you see (which is 
sometimes required), or more likely, just return something generic like 
ID, and let the parser work out what this represents.

You can emit() multiple tokens if you really need to, but the chances 
are fairly slim that you really need to I think. Gavin pointed out where 
you start, but the code needed to implement this is fairly involved and 
I bet if you just rethink your lexer/parser in an 'ANTLR' way, you will 
find you don't need to do it.

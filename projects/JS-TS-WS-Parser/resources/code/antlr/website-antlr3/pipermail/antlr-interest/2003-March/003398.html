<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have run into an issue with ASTNULL and hetero-ASTs using Java 
</I>as 
&gt;<i> &gt; the target language (IIRC C# doesn't have ASTNULL and it isn't an 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issue with C++).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My comments about C# is inaccurate - it does have ASTNULL and hence 
</I>&gt;<i> the same problem. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In my limited analysis, ASTNULL seems to be used as a performance 
</I>&gt;<i> optimization essentially. I guess my focus is now on ideas for 
</I>&gt;<i> ensuring ASTNULL plays nice with hetero-AST usage.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is anyone mixing TreeParsers and hetero-ASTs?. Any issues?.
</I>
The basic issue is related to the casting of the cursor variable _t 
of type AST to other variables of hetero-AST types. The problem is 
that this variable sometimes contain the value ASTNULL (of type 
ASTNullType). 

Hetero-ASTs are typically derived from the AST-&gt;BaseAST-&gt;CommonAST 
lineage which doesn't include ASTNullType. Hence the 
classCastException.

If the lineage is changed to:
AST-&gt;ASTNullType-&gt;BaseAST-&gt;CommonAST

...the problem might go away. Question is, what - if anything - does 
this break?

&gt;<i> &gt; Specifically, there are a few situations where ASTNULL is 
</I>assigned 
&gt;<i> as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the value of a vriable then, an attempt is made to cast that 
</I>&gt;<i> variable 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whose value is ASTNULL to an hetero-AST class ==&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> classCastException! 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why does ANTLR-Java need ASTNULL?. 
</I>
&gt;<i> This issue only arises with TreeParsers incidentally and I've 
</I>&gt;<i> inherited a few I could do without ;-)
</I> 
Cheers,
 
Michael

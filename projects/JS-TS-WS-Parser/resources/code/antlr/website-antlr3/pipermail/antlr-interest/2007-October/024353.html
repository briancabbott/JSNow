Ter--

Take another look.  The '.' in the posted grammar is the character '.', not a wildcard; there is no ambiguity, just an LL(2) decision.  Unfortunately, the generated code makes an LL(1) decision and generates runtime errors as a result.  This is not a backtracking problem; note the selected workaround--it avoids having an epsilon alternative, but depends on k&gt;1.

--Loring

 &gt; ambig with NUMBER.  In lexers, ANTLR assumes you have prioritized the  
&gt;<i> rules in order so it hushes the warning and makes any digit predict  
</I>&gt;<i> number.  This is absolutely consistent with ANTLR parsers and tree  
</I>&gt;<i> parsers.  Done by same analyzer and code generator.  Please examine  
</I>&gt;<i> the following parser rule:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> test    :    DIGIT+ ('.' DIGIT+)?
</I>&gt;<i>     |    .
</I>&gt;<i>     ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR cannot possibly decide which alt to choose upon 0..9, right?   
</I>&gt;<i> It matches both alts.  ANTLR will complain.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I just love the discussion I see previously about how ANTLR is broken  
</I>&gt;<i> and doesn't do the right thing etc...  Trust me folks, I've been  
</I>&gt;<i> doing lexers, state machines etc... for a long time with the obsessed  
</I>&gt;<i> focus of a lunatic. You may not want antlr to do what it's doing in  
</I>&gt;<i> some cases, but I designed ANTLR to do precisely what it is doing in  
</I>&gt;<i> this case.  Not to say there aren't any bugs in other situations ;)   
</I>&gt;<i> There *is* a nasty analysis bug I have to track down at some point.   
</I>&gt;<i> Can't narrow it down yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway, looking at this it's clear to see that it examines only one  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; character of lookahead and basically decides that if there's a dot  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then the entire optional clause must be present
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> correct by how LL lexers (unlike lex lexers) work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -- despite the &quot;minimal satisfying input&quot; for that clause being a  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dot followed by at least one digit.  So its lookahead is clearly  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; insufficient for the task.  (It would have been right if that were  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a * or ? instead of a +, though.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Correct.  ANTLR would normally warn you about this problem, but in  
</I>&gt;<i> lexers it chooses not to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Remember folks: you can't just list a bunch of lexer rules that make  
</I>&gt;<i> sense to a human and expect ANTLR to &quot;make it so&quot;.  Same is true for  
</I>&gt;<i> parsers, right?  The confusion arises since antlr doesn't warn you.

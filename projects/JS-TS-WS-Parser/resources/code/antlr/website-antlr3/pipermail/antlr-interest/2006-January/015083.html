<PRE>I agree that &quot;protected&quot; is a bad wording, but I don't quite agree with
your splicing thing too. Basically your requiring the user to specify
within the rule that is using the &quot;spliced&quot; rule that the rule is
spliced. 

&gt;<i> which tells the reader explicitly that we're dealing with a 
</I>&gt;<i> non-tokenizing splice (no need to look up the defn).
</I>
I don't see why that would be desirable. To me, a &quot;spliced&quot; rule is
nothing special, except that it's internal to the lexer (maybe that
would be a much nicer wording?), and cannot be directly accessed from
the parser. The calling rule doesn't care about the fact, it just says
&quot;and at this point, I need the stuff defined in FOO&quot;.

Plus: it does not have the properties of a macro expansion, does it? And
if so: who cares? That's IMHO an implementation detail - from the
language point of view it's just a sequence of matches.

I'd propose to call those rules &quot;internal&quot; - as stated, they cannot be
directly accessed from outside of the Lexer (in the rule matching
meaning) and &quot;internal&quot; also expresses the Java protected behaviour.

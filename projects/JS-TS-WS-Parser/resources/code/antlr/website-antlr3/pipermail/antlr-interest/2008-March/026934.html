<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The &quot;meaning&quot; or &quot;semantics&quot; for a lexer is the sequence of output 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tokens.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The &quot;meaning&quot; or &quot;semantics&quot; for a parser is the output AST.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The &quot;meaning&quot; or &quot;semantics&quot; for a treewalker is whatever it outputs 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (some modified AST or whatever).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No.  Those are the output syntax forms of each (what I referred to as 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;sentences&quot; above) -- they do *not* represent semantics or meaning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you take an ANTLR grammar and remove all action code from it, then 
</I>&gt;<i> it will still take in input syntax and generate output syntax, but no 
</I>&gt;<i> inherent meaning is associated with it.  Thus left to itself ANTLR is 
</I>&gt;<i> a pure syntax recogniser/generator.  In addition to this is also 
</I>&gt;<i> permits semantic validation and constructs to be included, but this is 
</I>&gt;<i> convenience and is not essential to operation (except possibly for 
</I>&gt;<i> some syntactically ambiguous languages).
</I>
Hmmm. I disagree, but I'm not sure what to say.
A lexer takes letters 'c', 'a', and 't' as input and outputs the word &quot;cat&quot;.
If the word &quot;cat&quot; isn't the &quot;meaning&quot; of those letters, then I'm 
completely lost.
If you're saying that the lexer's ability to accept those letters in 
that sequence is &quot;meaning&quot;, well, I disagree.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We NEVER see an AST being referred to as a &quot;syntax diagram&quot; (or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;syntax&quot; anything) - we call it an AST.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, and what does AST actually stand for?  Abstract Syntax Tree.  Oh 
</I>&gt;<i> look, it *is* referred to as &quot;syntax&quot;.
</I>Yea, good point. However, it's referred to as &quot;Abstract Syntax&quot;,
which has quite a different meaning than just &quot;syntax&quot;:
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax</A>
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps another more concrete example is in order here.  The input is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   int x = doCalculation(5);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a character stream which the lexer might convert into the 
</I>&gt;<i> token stream:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   KEYWORD[int] IDENTIFIER[x] ASSIGN[=] IDENTIFIER[doCalculation] 
</I>&gt;<i> OPAREN[(] NUMBER[5] CPAREN[)] SEMI[;]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The parser takes that token stream and converts it into the following AST:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   ( DECLARATION KEYWORD[int] IDENTIFIER[x] )
</I>&gt;<i>   ( ASSIGN[=]
</I>&gt;<i>     IDENTIFIER[x]
</I>&gt;<i>     ( FUNCTIONCALL IDENTIFIER[doCalculation] ( NUMBER[5] ) )
</I>&gt;<i>   )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Everything we have done up to this point is still all just syntax.  
</I>&gt;<i> This is a perfectly valid AST and thus the input is valid syntactically.
</I>It doesn't seem odd to you that you're refering to the shape of the AST 
as &quot;valid syntactically&quot;?
Would you say that &quot;x int;&quot; is &quot;syntactically invalid&quot;?
I would say it's &quot;syntactially valid&quot;, but &quot;semantically invalid&quot;. When 
I say that, it's implied that I'm
talking about a parser, not a lexer (for which it's syntactically and 
semantically valid) or a treewalker
(for which it's a mute point, because the parser will not accept it).
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But what happens when we start to verify the semantics?  What happens 
</I>&gt;<i> if it turns out that &quot;doCalculation&quot; isn't actually a function, or 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't take a single numeric parameter, or doesn't return a type that 
</I>&gt;<i> can be compatibly assigned to an integer variable?  What happens if 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;x&quot; had already been declared as a string variable?  Those are all 
</I>&gt;<i> semantic tests and they are independent of the AST itself.  So what 
</I>&gt;<i> was perfectly valid syntax may be semantically incorrect.
</I>Yup.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR lets you choose whether you want to do the semantic checks right 
</I>&gt;<i> at the end (in your own driver code, or in a tree walker), or whether 
</I>&gt;<i> you want to do them inline at the lexing or parsing stages (either to 
</I>&gt;<i> fail quickly or to resolve syntactical ambiguities).  
</I>&gt;<i> But being able to insert them inline doesn't mean that they're 
</I>&gt;<i> directly linked the way you seem to have been saying.  They remain 
</I>&gt;<i> separate and distinct things.
</I>I'm not sure what you're saying here. What two things are distinct?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder if this is a similar confusion to that caused by having a 
</I>&gt;<i> combined grammar with literals in the parser rules -- it's permitted 
</I>&gt;<i> for convenience but it doesn't change the fact that they're treated 
</I>&gt;<i> separately (by modifying the lexer).
</I>Again, I'm not sure what you mean. Who is confused about what?

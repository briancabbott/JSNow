<PRE>ugh.  Ok, so anybody know mailman really well?  I had to set the 
reply-to field to be the sender not the list in order to avoid mail 
loops.  A quick check of the web indicates this is a known and nasty 
problem with vacation programs not looking at the &quot;bulk mail&quot; header 
and sending mail to a list.

The big question is, how does yahoo make this work?  They couldn't do 
anything else right ;)  (i.e., search, etc...).

I hate having to retype <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">antlr-interest at antlr.org</A> each time when I 
reply. :(  I also hate getting the vacation replies ;)  Ok, that's it.  
No more vacation for anybody! ;) &lt;snicker&gt; &lt;snort&gt;

Please send me mail directly (parrt at cs.usfca.edu) to let me know 
about suggestions etc...

One possible solution is to keep yahoogroups.com and I'll just fix the 
&quot;view/search mail archives&quot; problem.  It's easy.  I have 3 years of 
mail in a single mbox file and can index that trivially.  ugh...i'd 
kind of like to move off yahoo though.

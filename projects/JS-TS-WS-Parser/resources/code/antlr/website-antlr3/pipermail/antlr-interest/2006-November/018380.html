<PRE>Hello All:

I'm trying to use ANTLR 3.0b4 in ANTLRworks, and I have a few things I'd 
like to ask.

1) I'm chomping at the bit to try Ter's new Anltr 3.05b (if I have the 
version number right),
    so I'm looking forward to the new release of ANTLRworlks.  If anything 
I'm asking
    is fixed in the new version, I haven't had a chance to try it yet due to 
my choice of
    development environment, so just let me know.
2) I am using an AST but for some reason, neither @header{} @members{} seem
    to have the deisred behavior as  appears to be
    indicated in the wiki nor does header{} appear to work.  I want to set 
the java package
    name and perhaps use some imported libraries.

The relevant syntax looks like:
grammar MyGrammar;

options{
	output=AST;
}

/* This won't compile
@header{
	package mypackage;
}

// Additional members for the derived Parser class
@members{

	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
// Body of main omitted
	}

}
*/

tokens{
// This all works.
}

3) I would like to add some Java source to invoke some actions in my 
grammar.
    Do I need code to walk the AST, or can I try to accomplish them during 
the AST
    construction phase, I expect I'll be using both inherited and synthetic 
attributes in my rules.
If I have a rule like

command:
    (
        c1=commandType1-&gt;(COMMAND $c1) // Here I would like java code for 
command processing
    |
        c2=commandType2-&gt;(COMMAND $c2) // Here too
    );

I took a quick look at the wiki and it appears there is some @actions stuff 
but I don't grok it yet.

Regards:

Bill M.

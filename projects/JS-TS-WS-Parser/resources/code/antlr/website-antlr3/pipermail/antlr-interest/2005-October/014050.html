I tried some examples, but can you give me an example where the above
grammar fails?

&gt;<i> However, what you have ( if (int(...) &lt; )...) is not a syntactic but a

</I>So, can i take this as a rule of thumb:
&quot; If i am using an If in the action to check some property of the a
label, it can be made a semantic predicate in the rule&quot;.

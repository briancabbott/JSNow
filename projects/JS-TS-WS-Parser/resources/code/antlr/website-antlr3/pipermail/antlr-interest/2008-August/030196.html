Well,That was an interesting paradox I had to solve. basically, I  
realized that explaining how to print out &quot;3.152e-13&quot; is much easier  
than explaining how to recognize it properly. but, how can I talk  
about generators without talking about readers first. It turns out, we  
can do lots of things. The examples I chose include object to  
relational mapping (uses reflection) and a vector math to postscript  
translator that turns the printer into a vector math interpreter. At  
first, I have a set of handbuilt objects to represent operations. A  
GUI or something else could easily build these without resorting to a  
reader. Then I morph that into more of a standard tree structure and  
show how to use templates and so on to generate the appropriate  
postscript.

Then when I do readers, it will start to fall into place. :) Do you  
think that will work?

&gt;<i> And because you wrote that &quot;each part will use techniques and
</I>&gt;<i> patterns identified in the previous parts&quot; I find it quite confusing  
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> have Readers after Generators.
</I>
Agreed if you look just at the table of contents. You think my  
approach will work as explained above?

&gt;<i> Does the Readers part build upon
</I>&gt;<i> Generators?
</I>
Well, In fact it does the reader section now knows what its target is:  
trees. :) It provides the goal before the thing that can create those  
data structures.

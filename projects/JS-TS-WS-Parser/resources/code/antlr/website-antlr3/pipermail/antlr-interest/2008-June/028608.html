 &gt;That isn't supposed to be necessary. I did explicitly test all

Really -
 &gt;is this an isolated problem? I once had to use .Text in 3.0.1, 
too,
 &gt;which prompted my quest to undo this difference. But a search 
where
 &gt;.Text would be translated failed to show up any result, a test
 &gt;grammar created to replicate this issue worked fine (for 
whatever
 &gt;reason), and as the runtimes otherwise don't touch the action
 &gt;translation stuff, I doubt that the target choice does affect
 &gt;things. But you could test if Java gives the same problems. I'll 

 &gt;test that myself this week, once I get my development workbook 
back
 &gt;and can recreate my test environment. Due to an unforeseen 
problem
 &gt;with wildlife it may not be Monday as planned...

I've used $x.text successfully in both a combined parser and tree 
parser (build 2008-04-09.18, CSharp2 target).

One thing that I have noticed is that the attribute replacement 
only works to one level -- eg. $a.token and $b.text both work, but 
$a.token.text doesn't.  But that's not a big deal.

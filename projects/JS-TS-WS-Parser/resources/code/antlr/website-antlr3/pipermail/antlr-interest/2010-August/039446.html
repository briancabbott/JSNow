Input: aaaaXXXXbbbb wwwXXX ddddYYYzzzz

XXXX is the start marker, YYY is the end marker.
A non LL(1)-prefix of the marker(s) (here `XXX') may appear in between.
There is no separating char between markers and surrounding text.
Markers don't start with the same char.

There are ca. 20 start and 20 end markers, all of them different.
(This is a data file that must be analyzed.)

I need to detect (and validate) space separated words between the
markers.

With lexer backtracking, the grammar would read

----------
input : text
	START1 word (WS word)* END1
	word WS word
	START2 word (WS word)* END2
	text
	START1 word (WS word)* END1
	EOF
	;
text : (WS|NONWS)* ;
word : NONWS+ ;

START1 : 'XXXX' ;
END1 : 'YYY' ;
START2 : 'HHHH' ;
END2 : 'MMMM' ;
fragment WHITE : ' ' | '\n' ;
WS : WHITE ;
NONWS : ~WHITE ;
----------

with more START and END definitions, of course. And input is
longer, as it defines the whole data file structure, e.g., with
some alternatives in marker order or such.

Defining word as a lexer token is not possible as it would match
'aaaXXXXbbbb' and would be the longest match. Some different
lexical grammar? There is no selection of characters that are
specific to the markers. The definition of a word is really `a
sequence of non-whitespace characters that is followed by one of
the 40+ marker strings or a whitespace'. Using lexical filters is
not possible either; I analyze and validate the complete data file.

I hope this makes it more clear why I asked for the best practice
for lexical backtracking. It's at the heart of the grammar above
and was the minimal example that I came by that explains my problem
on technical level.

	Joachim

PS: I don't construct a tree, there are actions triggered by the
markers, the words are the parameters.

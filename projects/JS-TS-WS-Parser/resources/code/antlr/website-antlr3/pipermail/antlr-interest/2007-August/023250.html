</I>
&quot;List&quot; is a more general term and is frequently used to describe 
any sort of collection, although it is more commonly used to 
describe an ordered collection rather than a hashed one (those 
tend to be called &quot;hashtables&quot;, &quot;maps&quot;, or &quot;dictionaries&quot;).

Or if you prefer, &quot;list&quot; is an abstract base class, of which one 
implementation is &quot;vector&quot; and another is &quot;linked list&quot;.  (This is 
not really accurate, it's just using the terms in evil ways to try 
to present a point.)

&gt;<i>The reason I thought that list would supported persistent IDs is 
</I>&gt;<i>that the list routines are built on top of Jim's hash table 
</I>&gt;<i>routines.
</I>
I wasn't really referring to any of the current implementation -- 
I was just saying what those particular terms mean to me, and how 
I've commonly heard them used in the wider world -- and so 
consequently what sort of behaviour people would tend to expect 
when presented with a class-like structure that called itself a 
&quot;list&quot;.

&gt;<i>If that's the case, then one way to fix list to handle persistent 
</I>&gt;<i>IDs would be to use an increasing integer value as the key, 
</I>&gt;<i>supplied by list add(), to the hash routine.  Right now, it uses 
</I>&gt;<i>the size of the hash, which means it can decrease when items are 
</I>&gt;<i>deleted, causing keys to collide.
</I>
That solves the collision problem but doesn't solve the indexing 
problem (where if the first element is &quot;list[0]&quot; and then you 
delete it, you expect to see the former second element become 
&quot;list[0]&quot;).

I just don't think that something that calls itself a list should 
exhibit dictionary-like behaviour.  And I don't think 
dictionary-like behaviour is necessary in something like a list or 
tree of tokens.

As always, though, this is just my opinion :)  Offer void where 
prohibited.

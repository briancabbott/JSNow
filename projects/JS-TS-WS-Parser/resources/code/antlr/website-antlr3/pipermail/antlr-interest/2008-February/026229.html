Aha. The problem is that the grammar is not mine, I sort of inherited
it. It was written for antlr 2.7 (and it worked well) and my task was
to convert it so that it works with antlr 3. It is true that the
grammar has some ambiguity issues, there are more than three dozens of
syntactic and semantic predicates and the generated parser.java has
more than 100MB while the size of the parser generated by antlr2.7 was
only 2.3MB. I guess that conversion from 2.7 to 3.0 is not as easy as
I thought :)

Thank you very much, I shall do as you suggest - I'll try to rewrite
the problematic rules.

Hi,

In the java.g grammar, I'm trying to parse a list of statements, by repeatedly 
calling a rule statementComplete:

statementComplete:
	statement;

A statement, afaik, always ends with SEMI or &quot;}&quot;. However, it seems that the 
parser sometimes reads beyond that, probably for lookahead reasons.
For example, when parsing the following:

Method method = (Method) m;
final int myInt = 5;

After calling statementComplete once, and then calling the rewriteEngine's 
toOriginalString() method, I get:

&quot;Method method = (Method) m;
final&quot;

so the newline and &quot;final&quot; have been read as well, even though they obviously 
aren't part of the first statement. Is there a way to get rid of this? 
Preferrably a way to make sure no tokens are read beyond the actual 
statement?

Thanks,

Hans

PS Terence: there are a couple of minor bugs in the TokenStreamRewriteEngine 
as well:
1) In a couple of places, &quot;programName&quot; should be passed on to the 
addToSortedRewriteList, but isn't... (e.g. in public void replace(String 
programName, Token from, Token to, String text))
2) A delete operation should be defined as replace with text &quot;&quot;, not text 
null, because the latter will put the characters n-u-l-l in the string...

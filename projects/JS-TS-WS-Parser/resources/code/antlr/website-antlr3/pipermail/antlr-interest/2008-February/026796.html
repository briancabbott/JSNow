<PRE>Thank you Jim,
I did not Ignore the message, but I wasn't able to see where the real 
Problem was.

I have to check the Grammar again tomorrow but I think I know understand 
what Antlr tried to tell me.

</I>&gt;<i> Woah there! You are being misguided a bit here I think. Such warnings 
</I>&gt;<i> are real in that there are two ways that ANTLR could decide your 
</I>&gt;<i> grammar is structured and it is telling you that it is going to assume 
</I>&gt;<i> the alt other than the one it tells you is disabled. However, it is 
</I>&gt;<i> usually telling you this for a good reason. The reason is either that 
</I>&gt;<i> there is something actually wrong with your grammar, or that there is 
</I>&gt;<i> something wrong with the structure of your grammar. You should 
</I>&gt;<i> certainly not ignore such messages as they are far from irrelevant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here, I think you need to look at the precedence of your operators 
</I>&gt;<i> with respect to let. Then you probably would still end up with a 
</I>&gt;<i> warning because at a glance it seems there is a real ambiguity in the 
</I>&gt;<i> language. You can probably get rid of the warnings (once you rework 
</I>&gt;<i> this  a little) with small precedents if there is a real ambiguity in 
</I>&gt;<i> your language. I tend to do this just so I get a clean analysis and 
</I>&gt;<i> don&#8217;t miss any new warning that comes up. If you are the author of 
</I>&gt;<i> your language then consider that you might change it so that there are 
</I>&gt;<i> no ambiguities. For instance, is let really a part of the expression 
</I>&gt;<i> tree?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a (known) need to be able to turn off a particular warning 
</I>&gt;<i> for a particular decision in ANTLR, but of course you should only do 
</I>&gt;<i> this when you absolutely understand what it means and realize why you 
</I>&gt;<i> can turn it off. Don&#8217;t train yourself to ignore such warnings, learn 
</I>&gt;<i> how to turn them off as this will increase your knowledge of what is 
</I>&gt;<i> going on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In your grammar, the operators it is complaining of can associate with 
</I>&gt;<i> the expr that ends the let expr, which is probably what you are 
</I>&gt;<i> expecting, or the expr that contains the let as an expr. Your grammar 
</I>&gt;<i> allows let to be the expr that is part of a let, so you can have let x 
</I>&gt;<i> in let y in let b in g -&gt;yyyy  etc . SO, which let clause did you mean 
</I>&gt;<i> it to belong to? That is what ANTLR is telling you.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So it's not an &quot;error&quot; in my Grammar.
</I>&gt;<i> If this is so I'm glad, I spend hours to find a Way around this Message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was starting to think I just don't understand what Antlr is doing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I just discard dis Message.

</I>&gt;<i> I am not 100% sure that I am reading the red diagram correctly but 
</I>&gt;<i> this is my take on the problem. The green diagram says that an ARROW 
</I>&gt;<i> can follow an exp_direct as part of the dotorarrow rule. The red 
</I>&gt;<i> diagram says that the exit condition of dotorarrow (that is, a set of 
</I>&gt;<i> null transitions) can also lead to ARROW. This is caused by 
</I>&gt;<i> letexpression ending in exp which can ultimately be a dotorarrow. I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't know how to avoid the warning but I think both alternatives are 
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent. Alternative 1, the green arrow, is computationally more 
</I>&gt;<i> efficient and is probably what you want.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The bottom line is that there is an annoying irrelevant warning 
</I>&gt;<i> message that is hard to circumvent.
</I>&gt;<i> I would also appreciate any feedback on methods to avoid this kind of 
</I>&gt;<i> ambiguity.

</I>&gt;<i> so I set a scope with a boolean man variable and wanted to make a

 &gt;That's right, but how can I implement an island grammar under

 &gt;they have to be skpped in the lexer, and to avoid strings
 &gt;containing //s to be skipped, I implemented the string token
 &gt;rule also in the lexer. So I really need a way to handle my
 &gt;regexp problem in the lexer, too - or is there another way?

I vote for slapping the language authors around the head with an 
old fish ;)

Regexp literals like that are a hard problem, since you'll 
definitely need parser context to determine that it even is a 
regexp in the first place.  You might be able to cobble something 
together using a non-greedy token source (so it doesn't slurp the 
whole thing up in one go) combined with the &quot;island grammar under 
parser control&quot; example, so you can switch out the lexer and then 
switch back with the input position just after the regexp and keep 
going from there.  But it'll get messy.

Is there a good Perl grammar for v3 around somewhere?  That has 
the same kind of regexp literals, so that might give you some 
ideas.

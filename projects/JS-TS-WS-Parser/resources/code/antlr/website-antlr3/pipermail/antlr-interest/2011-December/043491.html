<PRE>I'm replying to a thread from awhile back, which I found on Nabble.  Hope
this is the right way to do it...just joined the list...pardon me if I have
the customs wrong here.

The error &quot;antlr3config.h: No such file or directory&quot; was the OP's problem,
and mine.  Jim Idle responded that the problem was that we just tried to
bring in the include/ and src/ folders from the source folders, and did not
actually install the runtime distribution.  He then pointed the OP to the
docs.

Unfortunately, doing it that way runs counter to my eventual goals.  I'm
trying to write code that will be incorporated into a larger project, and so
configuring and installing antlr on my particular machine does not solve my
problem.  Furthermore, my code is to be cross-platform, so I don't even want
to assume antlr installations/libraries exist in particular Unix-friendly
locations.

There must (?) be a way with a simple Makefile to get a C program that
includes antlr-generated sources to build and run.  (Perhaps I just need to
create a plain vanilla antlr3config.h by hand?)

Thank you for any help you can provide.

Nathan

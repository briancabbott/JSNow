<PRE>Ric,

Thanks for taking the time to respond.
 
&gt;<i> I trust you mean lex or flex?
</I>
Yup.  I've had way too much coffee this morning; of
course I meant flex.
 
&gt;<i> No. And it's not advisable to do so unless you
</I>&gt;<i> really really really really
</I>&gt;<i> know what you're doing. You'll very likely to break
</I>&gt;<i> the use of syntactic
</I>&gt;<i> predicates (if you use them). Line/column counting
</I>&gt;<i> might also be broken.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not saying it might not be possible to do though
</I>&gt;<i> but it would require
</I>&gt;<i> some serious debugging/testing, I would not be
</I>&gt;<i> surprised if it might be
</I>&gt;<i> impossible in some cases. It really sounds like you
</I>&gt;<i> want to use syntactic
</I>&gt;<i> predicates (e.g. guessing mode).
</I>
Yeah, I've had a closer look at the code since I
posted this morning and I realize now that there are
side affects I hadn't anticipated.  The line/column
stuff (a) seems easy enough to fix and (b) isn't very
important to me anyway, but the syntactic predicate
stuff is a different issue.  I don't use it currently
but I definitely want to keep that avenue open so I'm
probably going to ditch the 'roll your own' approach
and rework my grammar with predicates.  Thanks again
for your input.

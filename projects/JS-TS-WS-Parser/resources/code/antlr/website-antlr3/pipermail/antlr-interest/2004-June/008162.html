Bugger :-(

Yes, I did want to use a parser between my original lexer and parser. Or
can I put a lexer there instead? Basically, I don't care whether it's a
lexer or parser, I just want to sit it between my primary lexer and
parser to strip out stuff I don't want and/or modify stuff I do.

Can I lex a token stream as well as a character stream? And if so, will
the second lexer see hidden tokens (I presume not).

The trouble is (hint to Ter for the manual :-) that there's a chapter on
lexing, and a chapter on treeparsing, but nothing on parsing. And the
stuff on token streams implies substituting different lexers for
different things. I want to process the data in multiple passes, not
change to a different lexer.

Cheers,
Wol

If you're trying to make the rule work inside a ( )=&gt;( ) construct then
it
should be something RecognitionException like (or derived of it)

&gt;<i> feed the output from that into my main parser?
</I>
If you follow Monty's framework you should be ok I guess.

&gt;<i> And if I have a rule like
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> commentst : (EOL | SEMI) (&quot;*&quot; | &quot;!&quot;)! (~(EOL)*)! ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it will then eat everything between the initial eol/semi and final

&gt;<i> but it will let those two tokens through to the next parser?

If you write the code in nextToken to do that it will. The ! operator
controls treebuilding it's not the lexer's ! operator. At least I was
under
the impression you wanted to use a parser to do the filtering not a
lexer
in front of your original lexer.

<PRE>Tom--

This isn't an argument about ANTLR internals:  Oliver put forth an example for which he thought that tree transformation would be 
prohibitive due to lack of memory.  It was not a viable example, although he has yet to admit that.

As to performance:  there are always tradeoffs between performance and functionality.  Sometimes performance wins, sometimes 
functionality wins.  Chris Leung's LLK (which reminds me, I need to recreate a post--yahoo has Alzheimer's) errs on the side of 
performance, while ANTLR 2 errs on the functionality side (copying strings for tokens can be expensive, for example, but it also 
allows indefinite length input and editing of token text).  There is a reason that Chris sees a factor of five performance difference; at 
the same time, I don't think that he is (yet) headed in a direction that will support complex source-to-source transformation.  My 
experience with large software systems is that local optimization for performance (non-algorithmic) often makes global optimization 
difficult, as the code rapidly becomes &quot;unmaintainable&quot;, and can limit the potential for extending the system or using it as a building 
block in a larger system.  The trick is to properly assess the tradeoffs when making design decisions.

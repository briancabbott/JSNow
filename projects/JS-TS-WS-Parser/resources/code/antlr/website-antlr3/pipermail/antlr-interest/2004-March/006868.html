<PRE>Hi,

Hmmmm nice one you find a bug, the vanilla java grammar has indeed the same
problem. SL_COMMENT hangs when it's fed only '//'.

I can offer another solution now: switch to C++ mode it is doing the right
thing (complain it found an unexpected EOF). Also the sane fix for
SL_COMMENT which I expected to work works in C++ mode.

So...
a) Java codegen is generating the wrong bitset.
b) The java implementation of BitSet is incorrectly saying that EOF value
   65535 is in the bitset of what is supposed to be valid for the
   (~(\n|\r))* part.

Hmmm writing that down a little coin dropped...

c) Antlr should warn if you set the charVocabulary to '\u0003'..'\uFFFF';
   then it includes EOF. Which of course gets automagically added if you
   use ~ constructs.

So there's another easy fix e.g. limiting the charVocabulary of the lexer
to:

charVocabulary='\u0003'..'\u7FFF';

And change SL_COMMENT to:

SL_COMMENT
	:	&quot;//&quot;
		(~('\n'|'\r'))* ('\n'|'\r'('\n')?)?
		{$setType(Token.SKIP); newline();}
	;

And you should be set.

Cheers,

Ric

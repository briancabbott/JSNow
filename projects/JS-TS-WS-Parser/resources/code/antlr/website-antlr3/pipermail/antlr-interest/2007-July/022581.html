<PRE>I have a C++ parser but it parses preprocessed files not source files.
The problem with source files is that they can contain alternatives
controlled by #ifdef/#endif statements and they are not usually
complete and self contained anyway.
 
My version 3.1 is available from the antlr website but if you are
interested in it let me know as I have a 3.2 version nearing
completion which contains a number of corrections. However, AST
production would have to be added.
 
David.

Hello!

Maybe there are answers on my question allready on mailing list but I
am
trying to get informations to accomplish what I want too long so I
would be
very grateful and happy if somebody could help me...

I want to parse c++ source file to get AST so that I could make
queries:
- which functions are called in some function
- give me a list of all functions in this (header, cpp) file
- ...

So I would like to write a program that you input a source or header
file or
preprocessed file and you get AST. And then you can make queries...
And I would like to do that in windows and I would be really, really,
really
vary gratefull if somebody could tell me(give me links on tutorial,
tips,...) how to do that and if using ANTLR would be the best or is
there
anything easyer...

Tnx for any kind of answer!

marko

&quot;Real programmers are not afraid of regular expressions.&quot;

&quot;Without regular expressions, programming itself would be impossible.&quot;

And so on...


Truly, I don't know, but REs are surely better than some hand-written 
character-level analyzer, right?

Perhaps the answer is &quot;mu.&quot; That is, the question is the wrong one. 
Maybe trying to give users a half free-form, half markup language input 
format is just the wrong way to go. Give them either a real 
word-processing-style GUI or a nice rigorous mark-up language. Or, 
given how many people understand a little HTML (at least enough for 
italic, bold and the kind of things the OP mentioned), perhaps 
recognizing a very restricted set of HTML tags would not be a bad idea.

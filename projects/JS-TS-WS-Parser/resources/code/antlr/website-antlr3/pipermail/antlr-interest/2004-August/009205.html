<PRE> I am stuck with multiplexing + I have miscelleanous small questions
for which I am requesting your help

Let's consider the following text file that I want to parse:

java
{
 // some java code
}
c++
{
 // some c++ code
}

The structure is pretty obvious. I assume I have a java lexer/parser
and a cxx lexer/parser. Trying to reuse them, I make the following
grammar:
options {
   language=&quot;Cpp&quot;;
}
//++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
class multiparser extends Parser;
options {}

file
   : (javablock | cxxblock)* EOF
   ;
javablock
   : JAVA LBRACE
       {
           javaparser p(getInputState());
           p.parse();
       }
       RBRACE
   ;
cxxblock
   : CPP LBRACE
       {
           cppparser p(getInputState());
           p.parse();
       }
       RBRACE
   ;
//++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
class multilexer extends Lexer;
options
{
}

LBRACE: '{';
RBRACE: '}';
JAVA:   &quot;java&quot;;
CXX:    &quot;c++&quot;;

Now for the first problem: from what I understand of the example given
in the manual, the above lexer should switch a selector by pushing the
java lexer when we start the javablock, and pushing the cxx lexer when
we start a cxxblock. I also understand that switching lexers should
*not* be done in the parser (it was reminded in a recent thread about
&quot;rewinding tokens&quot;). So in my example, I should switch the selector
somewhere in the lexer, probably inLBRACE rule:
LBRACE: '{'
                {
                     selector.push(&quot;???&quot;);
                }
The problem is that in that rule, I cannot know which lexer to select!
This info is a semantic/parser one. And I do not want the lexer to
keep a pointer on the parser, do I?

The second problem is similar. Again from the example, I understand
that the popping of the selector should be done in the java/cxx
lexers. The problem is again that those lexers do not know that the
parsing of the java/cxx part is finished. In the manual example, the
termination of a &quot;lexer part&quot; is indicated by a very specific token
(such as //@} ) so lexers can catch them and pop the selector. But in
my example, the end of the block is indicated by } which is also a
regular (and widely used!) token of the java/cxx grammars. So I *have
to* do the popping of the selector in the parser !?!? Am I right? But
in that case, it does not work (I am trying it without success)
because of token lookahead (I understand that the &quot;closing }&quot; is eaten
by the java/cxx lexer and therefore not found by the multilexer when
the selector switch backs to it.

Any help on how to solve this (I believe rather simple) example?

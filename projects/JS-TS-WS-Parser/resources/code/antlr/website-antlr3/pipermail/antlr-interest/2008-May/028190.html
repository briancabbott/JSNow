 &gt;What resources does Intellisense need actually? As I can use the 

 &gt;source files I don't have difficulties with Intellisense myself, 

 &gt;but that doesn't help you. In the case of still missing data, we 

 &gt;can talk about further contributions.

The biggest aid to Intellisense is to enable XML documentation 
(project properties, Build, Output, XML Documentation File [your 
location may vary depending on IDE version]), then include the 
resulting .xml file in the binary distribution as well.

Of course that assumes you've been using XMLdocs in the C# 
source.  A cursory glance at it seems to show sporadic coverage 
(though not to worry -- enabling that option will generate 
compiler warnings for any publically-visible but undocumented 
elements).

The main thing to bear in mind is that Intellisense only really 
uses the &lt;summary&gt; and &lt;param&gt; elements.  While adding the other 
stuff is useful (both for reference in the source code and if you 
decide to run a full HTML doc generation), just remember that 
those need to be sufficiently understandable by themselves for the 
people who are only using Intellisense.

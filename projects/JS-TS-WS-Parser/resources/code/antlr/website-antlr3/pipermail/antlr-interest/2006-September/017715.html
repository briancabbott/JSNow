<PRE>Sorry,

It would have been better to test the grammar first without the WS rule in 
the QOUTES_STRING rule since I still get warnings (less though) and now I 
can't
figure out how to solve this.
Can someone please tell me how to prevent the multiple alternatives 
warnings?

Hi, 

I started converting my v2 grammars to v3 and ran against some warnings 
when generating code for a very simple test grammar. 
Below, you find the parser, followed by the warnings. 
This grammar is a part of a grammar in v2 which I am converting. 

In v2 the rule QUOTED_STRING was: 

QUOTED_STRING: '\'' ( WS | '\'' '\'' | ~('\'') )* '\'';         

Now in v3 I get this list of warnings (see below). 
In v2 the WS was needed in the QUOTED_STRING rule in order to increment 
the line counter properly. 
I think I can solve the warnings by leaving out the WS rule since in Antlr 
v3 I do not need to bother about incrementing the line counter. 

So, Can please someone confirm that I am right in just leaving out the WS 
rule from the QUOTED_STRING rule? 

Thanks!

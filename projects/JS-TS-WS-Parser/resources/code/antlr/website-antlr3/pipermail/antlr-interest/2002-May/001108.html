<PRE>Terence,

Thanks for your reply (and thanks to everybody else as well). I have 
responded inline below.

Another question I forgot to ask is: would it be possible to combine the 
ANTLR syntax for characters and strings, so that the single-quote (') 
and the double-quote (&quot;) become synonyms for each other? I have seen 
that some other parser-generating tools do not seem to distingush 
between strings and characters syntactically. This would allow me to 
write &quot;'&quot; instead of '\'' and '&quot;&quot;' instead of &quot;\&quot;\&quot;&quot;. Also, I think this 
kind of change would be backwards-compatibile.

Also, I would like to contribute an appropriate JAR manifest for 
antlr.jar but I don't see any place where I can send it. Can I just send 
it to the list as an attachment? I would like in particular to add the 
versioning information to the manifest so that a better answer to the 
&quot;how can I tell what version of antlr.jar I have&quot; FAQ.

</I>Thanks, I will read the chapter. As Loring pointed out, when I add 
actions, tree annotations, etc., I will likely see that there is not 
much similarity between lexer and parser rules anymore. But, I still 
don't see why it is necessary to use character case to distinguish 
between lexer rules and parser rules.

 &gt;&gt; sufficient? If not, is it (theoretically) possible for ANTLR to 
compute the minimum value
 &gt;&gt; of k needed for my grammar to be unambiguous?
 &gt; Yes. this is automatic. Slick, eh?


Yes, that is cool.

 &gt; LR reduces to LL(k) if I put actions in the &quot;right&quot; spot. ;)
 &gt; Nice little proof of this.

Could you point me to the proof? Also, if you have &quot;functional&quot; actions, 
are LL(k) and LR(k) then equivalent? Also, with functional actions, is 
your &quot;approximate&quot; LL(k) equivalent to full LL(k)?

 &gt; Anyway, adding syntactic predicates to any parser technology takes you
 &gt; beyond full LR(k) in strength as it is essentially backtracking.

Thanks.

&gt;<i>I got really pissed off the other day when i was updating the Java 
</I>&gt;<i>grammar--I wanted full LL(k) rather than my approx decisions...almost 
</I>&gt;<i>made me take a week off to go implement it! ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Would you mind posting this example? I'm really curious to see a 
&quot;real-world&quot; case where you would want full LL(k) instead of the linear 
approximation.

Thanks,
Brian

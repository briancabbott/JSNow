I'm completely missing your point here I guess...

</I>
Are you making the line between lexer and parser fuzzier?  
How about (LT(1).getText().length() == 1) ? Again I think I'm missing your
point.

&gt;<i> In the previous version, I made a number of decisions based upon the 
</I>&gt;<i> current state of the art in CPU speed / architecture, which of course 
</I>&gt;<i> changes pretty damn fast.  I wonder if we shouldn't just go 64 bit for 
</I>&gt;<i> the token types leaving a full 32-bits for characters and for token 
</I>&gt;<i> types all within the same value. 
</I>
Again what is the gain from this ? Will a struct/class not be cleaner at a
minor expense in speed and gain in portability/extendability/code
readability? (Let me state again I don't care much about the analysis
engine but I do care about the support lib)

&gt;<i> Who knows, this may also make some other things convenient.  What if we
</I>&gt;<i> could encode the TokenStream channel in the token type so we can &quot;tune&quot; to
</I>&gt;<i> only certain channels? 
</I>
This could be something usefull. It would complement nicely with
TokenStream multiplexing is my guess. Although you'd be demultiplexing
things with the channel. Then you'd be building a tree in one parser but
how would the stuff from the other parser end up in the tree (if you'd want
it there)

&gt;<i> What if we had special tokens other than EOF?
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps there will be a need.
</I>
Advice from a notorious overengineerder (me): don't! ;) KISS is the word
especially for a first version.

&gt;<i> Hmm...I wonder how fast 64-bit processors will become the norm (G5s are 
</I>&gt;<i> there and AMD is too, right?)?  How horrible does Java do 64-bit ints 
</I>&gt;<i> now for comparison and other rot?  ANTLR 3.0 won't be available for a 
</I>&gt;<i> while...perhaps 64 bits ain't that bad an idea.  BTW, passing around 
</I>&gt;<i> another variable is unwieldly coding wise and will just be two 32-bit 
</I>&gt;<i> ints anyway, right?
</I>
Why not pass a struct/class ? Again I'd be carefull moving into the 64 bit
arena too soon. Wait till the bugs die out first. This is probably a bigger
issue on the C++ side than on the java side (more vendors more problems).
 
Cheers,

Ric

<PRE>&gt;<i> There have been notable improvements in your amendments to ANTLRWorks,
</I>&gt;<i> thanks, but b5 to b6 has taken some steps back. I have noticed two
</I>&gt;<i> changes that are not helpful:
</I>&gt;<i> a) The ability to retain the size and position of project windows has
</I>&gt;<i> stopped working as a result of this upgrade - on Win2K/Java  
</I>&gt;<i> 1.5.0.09 at
</I>&gt;<i> least. Whatever the setting of the check box in Preferences, and  
</I>&gt;<i> making
</I>&gt;<i> sure that Apply is clicked, if ANTLRWorks is restarted or a project is
</I>&gt;<i> reloaded the standard window (top left corner and 800x600 overall)  
</I>&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;<i> appear.
</I>
Mmmm... yep, apparently it's broken on Windows but working on OS X.  
OK, I will fix that.

&gt;<i> b)In b6 the only way to alter the output directory seems to be to  
</I>&gt;<i> change
</I>&gt;<i> the overall preferences. On generation or debugging in b5 and  
</I>&gt;<i> earlier a
</I>&gt;<i> directory change dialogue was offered if a grammar file was altered  
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> saved, or even just reloaded. I found this very useful to keep work on
</I>&gt;<i> different grammars separate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first one at least was a change that you introduced (b1 to b2  
</I>&gt;<i> or b3)
</I>&gt;<i> in the development process and it would be a shame to lose it again,
</I>&gt;<i> whilst the second was welcome from the very first beta!,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's right but the previous dialog didn't offer a &quot;per grammar&quot;  
output directory: that's why I moved it to the preferences. But I can  
make a pref to display it each time you want to generate a grammar.

Thanks for your comments.

Regards,

Jean

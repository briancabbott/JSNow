<PRE>Hi torkild,
&gt;<i>Perhaps you should consider assigning an Eclipse builder to the plugin.
</I>This
&gt;<i>way which builder(s) will be used (and in which order) is controlled by the
</I>&gt;<i>contents of the .project file.
</I>I already do that and in fact the builder is the only place antlr is called.


&gt;<i>You should probably take a look at the plugin deployment classpaths. It is
</I>&gt;<i>possible to have different versions of the same classes in different
</I>plugins.
I am sorry i dont seem to get you.
As i already said, i dont reference the org.antlr jar in any place.

&gt;<i>Your plugin does not
</I>&gt;<i>seem to contribute some help. I guess it's early days still, but I'm
</I>missing
&gt;<i>clues on how to get started with the debugger.
</I>The help manual will be available in the final version as i have said on my
blog.
Meanwhile, you can see a demonstration video of the debugger at
antlrstudio.com &lt;<A HREF="http://antlrstudio.com">http://antlrstudio.com</A>&gt; :)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also you are not supposed to enable AS on a project which has AE enabled

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The solution to the 2nd problem is simple. I have put AS project nature
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a 'one-of' set. Scott can put the same 'one-of' set id in his plugin and
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thus you wont be able to enable both the plugins on the same project.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But I cant seem to find the solution to the first problem. Can anyone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; familiar with eclipse give me any suggestions on solving this?

</I>&gt;<i> This

</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> contents of the .project file.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is how the current situation is-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In the plugins directory, there are 2 files-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; org.antlr_xxx //for use by AE
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; AntlrStudio.Antlr_1.0.0 //for use by AS
</I>&gt;<i> This is a bad plugin name according to the Eclipse norm....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now what is happening is the AS runtime seems to be using the codegen of
</I>&gt;<i> '
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; org.antlr' instead of AntlrStudio.Antlr , although i dont reference
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; org.antlr anywhere.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is probably cause the package and class names are same in both the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; jars.
</I>&gt;<i> You should probably take a look at the plugin deployment classpaths. It is
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> possible to have different versions of the same classes in different
</I>&gt;<i> plugins.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So can anyone come up with any ideas on how to solve the problem?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For those wondering about the antlr_2.7.6 jar inside the
</I>&gt;<i> AntlrStudio_1.0.0
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directory, it is the runtime jar which is used when you run your
</I>&gt;<i> projects.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The AntlrStudio.Antlr is a special jar which contains special code used
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; internally by AS.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The antlr_2.7.6 is the normal antlr and is provided without a license,
</I>&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you can distribute it with your progs, while everything else including
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ' AntlrStudio.Antlr_1.0.0.jar' is proprietary.

</I>&gt;<i> While I'm at it; I've downloaded and tried you product for a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> days.
</I>&gt;<i> It looks cool :-). I think you should remove all IMarker instances from
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> resource before building, not just your own. If someone has i.e. markers
</I>&gt;<i> left

<PRE>Where's the legal stuff saying it CAN'T be compatible?

The whole legal fuss was over the fact that MS was calling their stuff
&quot;Java&quot; when it couldn't pass the certification tests, and was
*deliberately* making their implementation appear to produce portable
code when it was stuffed with Win32 extensions.

As far as I know, there is ABSOLUTELY NO BARRIER to MS including
Java-compatibility stuff. The two points at issue are that MS is acting
like a spoilt brat, and that Sun got an injunction saying that MS
couldn't call it &quot;Java&quot; unless it could pass the Java-compatibility
tests (or in other words &quot;don't abuse our trademark&quot;).

Cheers,
Wol.

&gt;<i> I was also able to use J# to generate Tool.exe file for .NET
</I>&gt;<i> As Tom mentioned, there was only one change needed, which it seems 
</I>Microsoft
&gt;<i> team missed from their java library implementation.
</I>
They did not forget. This is a legal issue. J# can be Java compatible 
up to version 1.1.4 while File.getParentFile() was introduced in jdk 
1.2.

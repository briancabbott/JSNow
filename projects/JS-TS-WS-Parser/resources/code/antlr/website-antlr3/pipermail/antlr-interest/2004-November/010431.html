<PRE>

Anakreon,
Thanks again for the input. Just a few comments.

&gt;<i> I think the domain is source-&gt;source translation.
</I>
After all this discussion, I'm starting to think of my thing
as at a bit higher-level than other translators (at least
ASPA). Yes, I do the simple stuff, but I'm mostly doing
the &quot;rewrite this C code in the way a human would rewrite it&quot;.
That includes stuff like:
* replace all library calls
* replace return-error-codes with exception handling
* remove all gotos
* replace enum/struct/union with a new class
* replace all pointers (by far the most complicated part of my app)
* restructure code (refactoring) to fit the Java style
* rename files, vars, methods to follow Java conventions
etc.

So I'd like to call my thing a &quot;language rewriter&quot; rather than
&quot;language translator&quot;. Where &quot;rewrite&quot; here means &quot;This C
code is a mess, let's rewrite it in Java&quot;, not &quot;term rewriting&quot;.

&gt;<i> The way of thinking is a matter of idiosynkrasi (I hope
</I>&gt;<i> this is the English word)
</I>Idiosyncratic, I guess.

&gt;<i> Hard problem but application specific. 
</I>
Isn't *everything* application specific? I mean If we're translating
from language A to B, and that's all we know so far, 
is there anything that we know needs to be done?
Even using a lexer or parser may not be necessary.

&gt;<i> An import may be required for the translated code in ASPA
</I>&gt;<i> too. In the XML file, a requirement for an import can be defined
</I>&gt;<i> for a class (if any member of the class is called an require 'file'
</I>&gt;<i> statement is generated), for a member (only if the member is called
</I>&gt;<i> the 'require' is generated) or a function. 
</I>
I had thought of doing it that way, too, but decided against it.
I didn't want to constantly have to worry about what
&quot;import-needed&quot; classes each rule might need. So I just
have a single rule at the end that has a list of all the
&quot;import-needed&quot; classes (kept in a file that's generated
from the Java source via a doclet - pretty cool),
 and searches for them.

&gt;<i> &gt; I would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guess there are a few more situations where I have to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do various transformations involving DOT. If so, I'd
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have to add even more unrelated cases to this one &quot;DOT&quot; place in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the code. That's slicing the problem the wrong way.
</I>&gt;<i> How can we discuss the right way of slicing a problem
</I>&gt;<i> in an objective way?
</I>
Yea, good point. Now I tend to think that my problem with
treewalkers is just due to my (possibly unique) approach.
As I mentioned elsewhere, perhaps my &quot;translator&quot; is functioning
more like a natural language translator.

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;This is very important because from the grammar definition
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;I can be sure that only those 3 cases can occur.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yea, I can appreciate that. You're sure you've handled
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; every possible input. But on the other hand, you're not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at all sure that you've handled all the cases.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For example, you surely have one place in the grammar
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that handles the &quot;+&quot; binary operator. You know you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have things covered by covering that one case with, say,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a call to a handleBinaryPlus() method. But what does that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; method do? Does it:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * remove redundant zeros (x+0 and 0+x become x)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * simplify expressions (x + -1 becomes x - 1)
</I>&gt;<i> No. ASPA is not a code optimizer but a translator.
</I>
Right, and mine is a &quot;rewriter&quot; - and a human wouldn't write
&quot;x+0&quot;, so I refactor stuff like that. 
(Note that this &quot;x+0&quot; is the example used by Terence
in his guide to treewalkers.

&gt;<i> &gt; * record the fact that each operand is involved in an arithmatic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   operation (and thus better not get it's type changed to boolean)
</I>&gt;<i> ASP and PHP(fortunately) are loosely typed languages. But still some
</I>&gt;<i> translating decisions are based on the types of the operands.
</I>&gt;<i> The way to handle this is based on heuristic methods and is not
</I>guarantied
&gt;<i> to be always successful.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * combine consecutive string concatenation where possible (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    becomes just &quot;ab&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> This can be done but I didn't do it. An other thing are expressions
</I>&gt;<i> like
</I>&gt;<i> a = &quot; there&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Response.write &quot;hello&quot; &amp; a 'prints hello there
</I>&gt;<i> which in PHP can be simplified into:
</I>&gt;<i> print(&quot;hello$a&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't do this because I'm not sure a user of the
</I>&gt;<i> program would think of it as a feature. He could prefer
</I>&gt;<i> to have print(&quot;hello&quot; . $a) instead. But it can be easily done.
</I>
Yes, I don't do that one either, but I do similar stuff.
I have 19 rules (written in Java - more that are just written
with simple text) witch just do this &quot;normalization&quot;
(changes that do not change functionality, but just clean up
the structure), like add braces around &quot;then&quot; and &quot;else&quot; clauses,
combine statements where appropriate, remove commas within
&quot;for&quot; clauses, etc.

.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Isn't it more natural to have a separate rule for each of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; above items? That way, 1) we avoid having this handleBinaryPlus()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; method performing 4 completely unrelated functions, and 2)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we avoid having the &quot;change x from int to boolean&quot; logic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; split across handleBinaryPlus() and other functions.
</I>&gt;<i> A matter of taste I'm afraid.
</I>
It's also a matter of degree, I think.
I suspect that most of the actions that fire within your grammar
only have a single &quot;rule to apply&quot; or at most two or three.
For me, just the fact that I have hundreds of rules and only
about 70 non-terminals in the grammar, means that I have
at least a few &quot;rules&quot; that apply at each grammar node.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I just don't see the advantage of this &quot;fire a rule at each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; node&quot; approach. As I look through my rules, almost none
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of them involve a single node in the tree.
</I>&gt;<i> Example:
</I>&gt;<i> a = &quot;one&quot; + true + &quot;two&quot; + new Date() + &quot;three&quot; + 5
</I>&gt;<i> (EXPR (ASSIGN a (PLUS (PLUS (PLUS (PLUS (PLUS one true) two) (NEW
</I>DATE ELIST)) three) 5)
&gt;<i> The translated one:
</I>&gt;<i> (EXPR (ASSIGN a (CONCAT (CONCAT (CONCAT (CONCAT (CONCAT one true)
</I>two) [METHOD_CALL, getdate]) three) 5)
&gt;<i> Except for the deepest PLUS, there are single node operands involved.
</I>&gt;<i> But each time PLUS rule is called it only cares about the [guessed] type
</I>&gt;<i> of it's operands. 
</I>
Ahhh...good example! To translate that line to Java, you've
got to first convert each of the non-string operands to
a String. To do that, you've got to know something about
what &quot;new Date()&quot; evaluates to, as well as what the other
operands evaluate to. You would need to change &quot;new Date()&quot;
to something, perhaps quite different, but ONLY do that
change because the &quot;new Date()&quot; appears inside an expression
involving &quot;+&quot; where the expresion will be String type. You cannot
just blindly convert &quot;new Date()&quot; to something without
knowing the context (maybe you can if you're just trying to
produce code that works, but not if you're trying to
write code that looks hand-written).

&gt;<i> &gt; And even when 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rules do involve a single node, I don't want to mix
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them together. For example, one rule removes the &quot;u&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in &quot;123u&quot; (java doesn't have unsigned types). And another
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; removes the &quot;L&quot; in &quot;123L&quot; (because a C long is [usually]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an Java int). Yes, I can have one handleNumber() method
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fire at the NUMBER node that does both of these. But
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd rather not slice the problem that way. Instead, I'd
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like the NumberWithURule to traverse the AST and make its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; changes, and the NumberWithLRule to traverse the AST and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make its changes.
</I>&gt;<i> ASPA is single pass, but you could do those transformations
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned above in many passes.
</I>
And how many passes (and associated tree-grammars) do I have to
have before it becomes a total mess? 10? 50?
I really don't want to keep track of all those rules each
doing multiple passes.
(say the &quot;new Date()&quot; conversion rule relies on the first
pass to find the &quot;new Date()&quot; pattern, another pass to
check the local context, a third pass to add some
&quot;import&quot; that the Date() class might need)

<PRE>We've been over and over this on this list. It's probably the mailserver on
the receiving end that's filtering out dups...

-- Scott

&gt;<i> Well, I've received several messages now from the list where 
</I>&gt;<i> I was named as an explicit recipient as well as it being sent 
</I>&gt;<i> to the list as a whole -- and I only ever received one copy 
</I>&gt;<i> (the one sent privately; there was no additional message from 
</I>&gt;<i> the list).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure why it would be behaving differently for you 
</I>&gt;<i> (unless possibly you're using a different email to post than 
</I>&gt;<i> the one you subscribed with).  Maybe you need to have a look 
</I>&gt;<i> at your user options for the list?

<PRE>Hi,

 

In the scripting language we've implemented we need to add similar
functionality

to the C++ #include, #ifdef, #else, #endif, #define.

 

I have already implemented #include by using a tokenstream filter - this
seems to work well.

Question: is this the best way of implementing preprocessing? Also does
anyone have

suggestions about how to implement the other preprocessing functions?

 

Cheers,

Ron

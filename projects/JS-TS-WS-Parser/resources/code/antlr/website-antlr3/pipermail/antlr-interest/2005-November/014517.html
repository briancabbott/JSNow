<PRE>And don't forget, in some languages newlines have semantic meaning.

For example, in DATABASIC, they can be a *block* terminator.

I have a load of code to handle newlines, for precisely this reason. Oh
- and don't forget you're jumping to assumptions that a newline is \r
and/or \n. I've worked on a system where it could be (iirc) \n or \n\0.
Lines were stored in an exact multiple of 16-bit words, null-padded ...

My preferred solution would be a special code eg '\lf' which is platform
dependent, but even that screws up - I do a load of work on Windows then
process it on linux - it's nice to work with tools that don't care.

Cheers,
Wol

Yeah, please don't do that. You too ;-)

What about

NL: (('\r' ( '\n' /* Windows */ | /* empty, MAC OS &lt;=9 */ )
    ) | '\n' /* the proper way ... */ ) { newline(); };

(untested, but works, doesn't it?).

It's a documentation issue, just put it into a prominently linked FAQ.
Also tell people which method to override in case they want to count
from 0 (e.g. &quot;return super.getLine() - 1;&quot;).

I would opt against doing the newline magic behind the scenes
automagically. Doing newlines properly is a good exercise to get started
with ANTLR, and those who can't get it to work with some documentation
have much bigger problems. On the other hand, there are people parsing
binary files (line what?), people using Eclipse (that's the offset
people ;-)), people who want to provide proper line/column numbers to
users. It's easy to do all of these, just some minor Java work. IMHO
ANTLR should keep out of that business.

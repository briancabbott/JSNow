&gt;<i> Hi Sam,

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your comments. More below on your questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm curious as to why you want to sometimes consider whitespace, though. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is this a self-designed language, or a specification you're working from 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that makes whitespace 'sometimes' significant?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You example was a function call or declaration. You can always get help 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>from the lexer here if there are situations where there *must* be a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> space, and situations where there *mustn't* be a space, and nothing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> else... have tokens that include the lparen.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I am considering the least-messy way to tackle a few of these issues in PHP. (And the function example I gave was just a simple example, not a problem in PHP.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One example that PHP has is the use of &quot;$&quot; as a prefix to identifiers, sometimes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An ordinary variable:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     $myvar    = 'hello';
</I>&gt;<i>     $othervar = $myvar;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Everywhere that such a variable appears, the dollar prefix is required, and no space is allowed. Now it's tempting to write the grammar as:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> variableName 
</I>&gt;<i>     : Dollar Identifier ...
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> Identifier
</I>&gt;<i>     : ('a'..'z' | 'A'..'Z' | '_')  ('a'..'z' | 'A'..'Z' | '0'..'9' | '_')*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This Identifier rule is good for all named things in PHP, but the parser rule would allow whitespace between $ and Identifier, which is not accepted by the actual PHP parser.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, maybe it's better to stick the &quot;$&quot; at the beginning of the lexer rule for Identifier (call it DollarIdentifier or something).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But then you get to variables that are members of a class/object. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     class C {
</I>&gt;<i>         var $mymember = 'Hello';
</I>&gt;<i>         ...
</I>&gt;<i>     }
</I>&gt;<i>     $c = new C();
</I>&gt;<i>     print $c-&gt;mymember;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note how the declaration uses a $ prefix, but the usage does not (the only $ is on the object variable, not the id of the member variable).  But I'm somewhat loath to handle the $ sometimes in lexer rules, and sometimes in parser rules, as this seems apt to confuse later. (Maybe not... I haven't assessed how messy it gets going down this path.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do indeed see ways to lex/parse this more strictly, I'm just exploring for the least messy way.
</I>
My limited experience has shown me that the more complex way usually 
ends up less messy in the end...

I'd lex $id and id entirely separately, as they are syntactically 
distinct entities. $blah is always a variable, a &quot;true&quot; variable, and 
$c-&gt;member should be three tokens - a VARIABLEID ($c), a MEMBER (-&gt;) and 
an ID (member). If PHP requires there be no space between those tokens, 
then that might be a problem, but conceptually you'd parse it to a tree like

^(MEMBER VARIABLEID ID)

or, filling in values,

^(MEMBER $c member)

The point being that -&gt; is a member operator. Your tree walker would see 
the $member and give that class a member called member, perhaps, which 
the MEMBER operator would fine. It's easy to trim/add a '$' from a string.

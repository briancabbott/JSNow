I'm sure there's more, because I vividly remember those dicussions.  
sorry I have no links right now. Maybe it was back 2006, dunno. The  
first beta release wasn't the beginning of development on v3. I've  
been involved since late 2005 and at the time Ter had been working on  
it for quite some time, already.

The ! operator is pretty ugly to implement when all you have is  
indices. If you are copying text like v2 does, it's trivial, because  
then you just don't copy the text for a token/char if there's the !  
operator tacked on.
With indices there can be holes in your character index ranges which  
makes it non-trivial to assemble the text later on, aside from the  
complexity of storing these non-contiguous ranges.

It is possible, but there are workarounds for most of the cases where  
you might want it. If everything else fails, it is possible to  
implement (and I think the ! is properly lexed and parsed by ANTLR).  
So in theory you could write it yourself ;)

IIRC Ter was against implementing it for ANTLR v3 because it is hard  
to get it right *and* efficient.

cheers,

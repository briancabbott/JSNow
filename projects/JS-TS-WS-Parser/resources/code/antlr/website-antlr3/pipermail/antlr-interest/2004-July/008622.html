&gt;<i> is what I'm doing in my projects so far) Once you got a homogeneous

&gt;<i> you can quite easily convert it to a custom structure that better
</I>support
&gt;<i> visitor like patterns and such.
</I>
Well that is what I was attempting in the original note in this message
but I couldn't get that to work either!

&gt;<i> I hope we can get the heterogeneous stuff right in ANTLR 3. (Or if
</I>someone
&gt;<i> gets inspiration to lobotomize the current ANTLR 2 codegen interface)
</I>
Well, once I get ANTLR to build my tree the way I want it, I'll try to
put something together to show what I did how I would like things.
Obviously, if my needs are unique then I don't expect much support for
them from ANTLR.  So far, I find the grammar much easier to follow than
before with the added benefit that I'm not casting stuff all over the
place or introducing lots of complexity to support tree parsing.

&gt;<i> It might be though that the problem on the java side is easier. The
</I>&gt;<i> absence of the Reference counter's in java might make things a lot
</I>&gt;<i> less painfull as things are on the C++ side.
</I>
Keep in mind that I'm doing this in **Java**.

&gt;<i> Cheers,

<PRE>Ter has consistently said he wants Antlr to be widely used, and has
deliberately chosen the BSD licence so that it can be used in commercial
products ...

So whether Antlr Studio is free- or pay-ware, I think it's a safe
assumption that he approves.

So if Ter approves, what right do the rest of us have to whinge (and I
suspect the majority of Antlr contributors concur with Ter - they
wouldn't have contributed otherwise).

Cheers,
Wol

&gt;<i> I'm honestly surprised that there's a cost here.  When ideas were
</I>being
&gt;<i> collected, there was no mention of that detail when asking for
</I>feedback,
&gt;<i> suggestions, etc.  Now to find out that it is a for-profit venture is
</I>&gt;<i> puzzling.
</I>
&gt;<i>From now on anyone who posts a question on the mailing list is
</I>required to explicitly mention whether the replies to it would be used
in a commercial product or not.
Only the free ones will be answered and if you got a for-profit
venture behind it then you will be required to pay for the answers.
All ideas, feedbacks, suggestions will be given to free projects only.
For - profit ventures are illegal and banned from anything related to
ANTLR.

<PRE>Yes, go with StdCParser / GnuCTreeParser combo unless you want to make your
own StdCTreeParser.g by pruning away the gnu stuff.  The idea was that the
trees from StdCTreeParser should work perfectly with GnuCTreeParser, so
fixing in StdCTreeParser would be the most help.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Re: cgram and SEMI! usage

Yes, I'd like to keep it as simple as possible, but since there isn't a
corresponding 
StdCTreeParser, how well matched are GnuCTreeParser.g and StdCParser.g? 
I don't plan on using GnuCTreeEmitter at all, the only concern is
compatibility with 
GnuCTreeParser.  So, is the the StdCParser / GnuCTreeParser combo still my
best bet?

How does the expandedGnuCParser.g relate to all of this?

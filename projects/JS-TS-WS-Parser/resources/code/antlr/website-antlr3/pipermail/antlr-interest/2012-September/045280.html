<PRE>Thanks to all for the enthousiasm and first advices, I appreciate that.

So, if I understand, I now have two choices: look into the existing
implementations for the 3.4 (there is quite some), or start directly on the
4.0. If I understand correctly, the target system changed quite a lot in
between, but the documentation/community experience is still (logically)
quite low for the 4.0 version.

What would be your advice on this ? I do not want to work on something that
will be gone in some months but on the other hand, I cannot wait too long
to start.

On another matter entirely, does anyone that developed a target in the past
remember (roughly) how much work it is/was ? I'm an antlr user, but never
modified much until now, except playing with grammar.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Martin,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you probably know, but for the benefit of others, each conversion of
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR to another grammar typically done by an individual on their own
</I>&gt;<i> personal time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Java is the only grammar version created by and maintained by Ter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The C version, by Jim Idle, is very actively maintained and supported here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The C# 3 version was done by Sam Harwell, and while he would like to
</I>&gt;<i> maintain it, he is working on an advanced degree and ANTLR Works 2, so C# 3
</I>&gt;<i> is in an on again off again mode, and Sam has stated that he does plan to
</I>&gt;<i> get back to it, but last I heard from him a few months ago, don't expect
</I>&gt;<i> anything on ANTLR 4.x C#  this year and even first quarter next year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you also know, the other versions are either attempts that were never
</I>&gt;<i> completed, completed but not fully tested, working but not maintained past
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> few versions, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The last version I know of that someone created without having done one
</I>&gt;<i> before was the C++ version. That person left several key notes in the post
</I>&gt;<i> here several months back so that is where I would start. I tried to search
</I>&gt;<i> antlr.markmail.org for the post but C++ search is returning C post also.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The big question is, will you be doing a 3.4.x version or a new 4.x
</I>&gt;<i> version.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are doing a 3.4.x you will have to dig into StringTemplate as that
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> used to generate the source code files. Beyond that I can't help. I once
</I>&gt;<i> did
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of work on the C#2 version, but that was many years ago and that
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge has lost its value.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The new ANTLR 4.x version is a different beast from what little I have
</I>&gt;<i> worked with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Low on my list is to do a ANTLR 4.x F# target, more for the AST
</I>&gt;<i> transformations than the lexing and parsing, but right now I am focused on
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> different project so that may never see the light of day.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My best advice is to go for it and ask questions here. Others who have done
</I>&gt;<i> targets will give you what advise they can. I can say that doing one puts
</I>&gt;<i> you a different level of understanding how ANTLR works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best wishes, Eric

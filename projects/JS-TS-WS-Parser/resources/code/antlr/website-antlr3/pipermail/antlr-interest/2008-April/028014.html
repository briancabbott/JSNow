<PRE>We know about this, and know it needs to be fixed. What is probably needed is a custom writer for the templates used in the code generation.

Subject: Re: [antlr-interest] inconsistent line endings in generated parser and lexer

 

I'm guessing this is a problem with the templates that are used to generate the lexer and parser.  I've also noticed it when debugging grammars in Visual Studio because any time you generate your parser it pops up a box asking if you want to normalise the line endings - a bit annoying.  I'd second that request.

2008/4/22 Doucette, Charles &lt;<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">cdoucette at vaultus.com</A>&gt;:

I have a grammar file which I have been editing in Antlrworks on Windows.

Apparently, every one of those lines ends with CR-LF.

Every other line automatically generated by ANTLR ends with LF.

When you combine those two streams into the automatically generated parser and lexer, the line endings are inconsistent.

When I try to add those files to my source control tool (and perhaps I shouldn't try since it is generated), Subversion,

I get an error that the line endings are inconsistent.

It can handle all CRs (Mac?), all LFs (Unix) or all CR-LFs (Windows) - but it apparently doesn't like a mixture.

Is it possible to configure ANTLR to generate consistent line endings?

If not, I'd like to request that as a feature.

Today, perhaps I must just remove CRs from my grammar input file before processing it.

 

Thanks,

Chuck

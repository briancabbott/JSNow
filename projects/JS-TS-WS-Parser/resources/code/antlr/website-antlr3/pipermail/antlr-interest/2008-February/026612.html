intervals by about 4). For another, I'm overly reluctant to abandon an 
approach after I've started trying it (if I wasn't I'd have abandoned 
Antlr about 15 min after I first looked at it). This time: because I 
wasn't deleting the .cs files and I had managed to kick it into working 
from the command line the last I was working. Visual studio was just 
using the old files.

I don't known what to expect to come out the back end so the fact that 
nothing noticeable was change didn't clue me in as fast as It should*. 
Also a fair part of that time was spent searching through the docs and 
samples for examples similar to what I was doing.

* when you have no idea what's wrong or how the details work, it's 
really can be hard to tell what's important. Sort of the inverse of

Understandable, but as I mentioned in my other post, &quot;rule&quot; is 
ambiguous, so this terminology might be troublesome for people not so 
familiar with parsing or your approach.  In ParserWorld, &quot;rule&quot; is 
commonly a synonym for &quot;grammatical production&quot; (which may have attached 
actions) (and it could be a tree grammar production), but in 
JazillionTown it means specifically a function that does a little 
parsing and then some actions.  I think that will be confusing for your 
readers.  Unfortunately I can't think of a better term at the moment.

Howsabout &quot;target-centered rule-driven&quot; v. &quot;source-centered 
tree-driven&quot;?  Oh boy!  Acronyms: TCRD v. SCTD!  ;)

A Jazillion &quot;rule&quot; is analogous to an antlr &quot;rule&quot; turned inside out, 
and vice-versa, no?

But &quot;tree-driven&quot; makes sense to me, since it creates and uses ASTs, 
whereas Jazillion doesn't.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When I started with the tree-driven approach and using ANTLR to do 
</I>&gt;<i> tranformation, I felt completely bogged down in
</I>&gt;<i> AST structure and found myself constantly thinking about *how* to do 
</I>&gt;<i> things rather than what needed
</I>&gt;<i> to be done.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Well, that's where I have to hold my tongue, since it's all theoretical 
to me.  But as a general issue, I wonder how much of that is 
attributable to Antlr's meta-language, by which I mean the English 
language used to document the works.  After all, anybody who can read C 
and understand C code must be parsing it, and therefore must have a 
structured model of the code rattling around in the skull: a tree, if 
not an AST.  If one sees &quot;if (x=1)&quot;, one can surely see that &quot;x=1&quot; is an 
expression, and that it is composed of a variable, etc.  Which amounts 
to a tree, even if one doesn't use tree language (parent, child, root, 
etc.) to talk about it.

In any case, I think you've put your finger on a very important point, 
namely that  even if the AST-based approach has advantages, it may 
require the fabled &quot;paradigm shift&quot;, and let's face it, most people 
coding to deadline don't have the luxury - it takes time, and there's 
always the risk that the new paradigm won't deliver.  So then the 
question is, can the AST approach be explained in a metalanguage that is 
closer to the way most programmers ordinarily think?  By the same token, 
can we come up with a meta-language for your approach that connects it 
with the implied parse tree/AST?  Hmm.  (If you can't tell, I'm actually 
much more interested in the expressiveness of language and metalanguage 
than I am in actual software. ;)

As just ANTLR enduser I don't see anything against that. Changes are good 
and I'd welcome them in full release (I prefer using full releases than 
development snapshots).

BTW. Will there be binmary only (precompiled ising GCJ) version shortly 
after release?

BTW2. I'd also wecome (as usefull add-on) the possibility of building just 
C++ libraries out of official release (as it was suggested in one of the 
recent posts).

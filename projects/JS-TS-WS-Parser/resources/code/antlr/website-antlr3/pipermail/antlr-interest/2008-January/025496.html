Ignore any differences from the description regarding the directory
structure. Things are probably a bit outdated.

&gt;<i> What I'm starting with is the examples-v3.  I installed nant 0.85, have
</I>&gt;<i> the source distribution's lib folder in my CLASSPATH, and ran &quot;nant
</I>&gt;<i> build&quot; from the csharp examples folder.  I get the error
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/antlr/Tool&quot;, but my
</I>&gt;<i> antlr-3.0.1.jar is in the classpath.  I tried renaming to antlr.jar,
</I>&gt;<i> but no change.
</I>
Actually, you have to put the jars into the &quot;_SharedLibs&quot; directory.
Unfortunately, the readme has a wrong naming scheme compared to what the
build file actually says. Note the 's' in &quot;_SharedLibs&quot; and the
different ANTLR-jar name. I'm using a depot version of the build file
where there may other changes compared to the 3.0-version, so you may
end up editing files yourself again, if I'd sent it to you.

&gt;<i> Also, the instructions in the examples README.txt seem to conflict.  It
</I>&gt;<i> mentions I need a lot of various files, but doesn't really say where to
</I>&gt;<i> get them.  I'm not sure if the source distribution includes everything
</I>&gt;<i> I need.
</I>
The files should be in the source distro (except the nant stuff).

&gt;<i> Can anyone help me out?  Thanks!
</I>
I hope I was helpful enough. :)

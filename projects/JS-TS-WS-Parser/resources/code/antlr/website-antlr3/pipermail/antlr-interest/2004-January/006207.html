<PRE>Seems to me it's
dimentia: (&quot;BAR&quot;)* (&quot;FOO&quot;)* ;

Perhaps with an action to ensure that at least one matched.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Infinite Recursion

Hello,

I'm just run antlr agains a yacc grammar and it
generated hundreds of 'infinite recursion' errors. 
I've spent quite a bit of time on the ANTLR site
(which is excellent by the way) and I'm trying to wrap
my head around all of this stuff.  I understand that
the errors are generated because ANTLR parses top down
so can't handle the Left Hand Recursion which is
common in YACC grammars.  I can convert the LHR for
the simple case which only involves one rule but am at
a bit of a loss to handle the following which is a
much simplified version of a piece of my grammar:

startRule: 
  dimentia;

dimentia:
  gentle | &quot;FOO&quot;;

gentle:
  &quot;BAR&quot; | dimentia;

which produces 3 infinite recursion errors.  I
understand the problem but it's not clear to me how to
fix it :)

On a related note - I've noticed that ANTLR doesn't
complain about the following grammar:

startRule:
  dimentia;

dimentia:
  gentle;

gentle:
  dimentia;

Though when I look at the generated parser it seems as
though it would obviously be infinitely recursive. 
Just wondering.  Thanks in advance for any replies!

-jason

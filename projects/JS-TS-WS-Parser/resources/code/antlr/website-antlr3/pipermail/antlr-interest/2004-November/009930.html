&gt;<i> Q1: As for how to use ANTLR to implement a Stack Machine: Couldn't I
</I>&gt;<i> simply emit the stack instructions from the Parser part of ANTLR?
</I>&gt;<i> (That's what I did in the hand coded lexer / parser I wrote). What are
</I>&gt;<i> the benefits of doing it walking an AST tree?
</I>
Can you do a purely syntax-directed translation for your language?  E.g.,
the answer is basically &quot;no&quot; if you have unresolved forward references that
you have to fix up.  [Of course, you could have your stack machine
evaluator be more complicated and do the fix-ups for you but that is, in
essence, another pass so you've just moved the problem from one place to
another.]


&gt;<i> I feel pretty comfortable setting up the Lexer and Parser part in ANTLR
</I>&gt;<i> (I think), but the TreeParser part is unfamiliar ground although I think
</I>&gt;<i> I grasp the basics.
</I>
&gt;<i> Q2: What would be easier: Implementing a debugger for the Stack Machine
</I>&gt;<i> or the solution where code is executed walking the tree (is this called a
</I>&gt;<i> register machine?)
</I>
(A) They are basically equivalent given good engineering (i.e., good
factoring).  The stack evaluator is a bit more localized but the tree
evaluator has the explicit context of the tree.

(B) A register machine is something that looks like a CPU.  I.e., it's
model wherein there are (banks of) registers in which computation takes
place, usually some form of &quot;hardware&quot; supported stack, and general/heap
memory.  GCC's RTL is an example of an intermediate representation (IR)
of a register machine model.

Hope this helps,
		John

<PRE>So, I am trying to get the software to email out and so I asked for  
my passwd.  It decided to reset it and then send it.  Too bad it  
didn't send it.  I can't log in now and I don't have my password.   
I'm pretty sure, this is not a very smart approach.  I *asked* for my  
passwd not a reset.  The page says &quot;send it to me&quot;.

So, we're screwed.  We have no admin capability.  Ugh.

Well, I need to get it working with MySQL anyway, so maybe I'll just  
reinstall and try to get it at wiki.antlr.org while I'm at it.  Can't  
do now as I have to leave for the day; maybe tomorrow.

Note that I&quot;m out of town (w/o laptop) from tomorrow after lunch  
until Monday night.  So, no email I don't think.

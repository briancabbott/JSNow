<PRE>I'm using a combined grammar with AST output paired with a tree walker
grammar on the CSharp2 target. I spawn 5 threads on a quad-core box and
the parse uses about 65% of the overall processor power while it parses
~2500 files in ~5 seconds.

Breaking the parse into multiple threads provided about a 3:1 speed
increase. Multi-threaded parsing isn't the difficult part; it's
combining the results from the individual threads into one place that
can cause problems if you aren't careful.

I have a mechanism where I spawn multiple threads to parse multiple
files.
It speeds things up quite a bit, mostly because doing it single-threaded
is
I/O bound. With the multiple threads, file reading and parsing can
happen
in parallel.

As for multiple cores, I don't know how much multithreading will help.
&gt;<i>From what I've read, it's not easy to get Java to utilize multiple
</I>CPUs.
I would think you'd have to have incredibly huge input for ANTLR to use
a lot of CPU to parse it. Anyway, it's pretty easy to try out
multithreading
in Java, so just try it and see what happens.

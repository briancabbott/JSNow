<PRE>Hi Eric, list,

I agree: a Google-group might be more suitable than chat.

</I>&gt;<i> One idea is to create your own Stack Exchange site. You could create the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://area51.stackexchange.com/">http://area51.stackexchange.com/</A> and <A HREF="http://area51.stackexchange.com/faq">http://area51.stackexchange.com/faq</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You will need to have at least 200 people committed and actively using the
</I>&gt;<i> site for it to make it into a real site. If you can't scrounge up 200 ANTLR
</I>&gt;<i> people, try creating a parsing site, then invite everyone you know who does
</I>&gt;<i> parsing and hope the moderators don't shut you down because you would be
</I>&gt;<i> taking away from other sites.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, I thought about that too and suggested it to Terence off-list, but
after looking into it a bit more, I don't think ANTLR/ST has enough
&quot;weight&quot; for its own SE-site. Especially these requirements:

- 15 questions per day on average is a healthy beta, 5 questions or fewer
per day needs some work;
- 1500 visits per day is good, 500 visits per day needs some work.

seem like a tall order if I look at the present ANTLR activity on
stackoverflow and on the list (not sure how active ST is...).



&gt;<i> Also, you might consider moving the ANTLR questions out of StackExchange
</I>&gt;<i> and into one of the other sites such as Computer Science, see:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://cs.stackexchange.com/">http://cs.stackexchange.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Seeing that many ANTLR related questions often have concrete questions and
target-specific (programming) questions, I think they're best suited in
stackoverflow, not the CS-sister site. Besides, I'm not sure if the SE team
is going to move more than 1000 questions: they do it with single
questions, or a hand full, but not such a large amount.

Regards,

Bart.

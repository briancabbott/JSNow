I looked at Cobertura. The best reference I found was
<A HREF="http://wiki.netbeans.org/CoberturaAnt,">http://wiki.netbeans.org/CoberturaAnt,</A> but as that page indicates at the
top, there are a few errors in the description, and I don't know what to do
about them, so I have not got Cobertura up and running, unfortunately. I
find ant files to be quite incomprehensible, in most cases.

Any better pointers for integrating Cobertura with NetBeans will be much
appreciated, but I do realize that we have strayed from ANTLR here, so this
probably isn't the forum for it.

&gt;<i> The parser file is color coded per line, but I can't see the

</I>&gt;<i> No options?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Not that I found, but they may be there. As you pointed out, the plugin is
in beta, so maybe not.


&gt;<i> &gt; Also, a large amount of the uncovered lines are exception handling,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; most of which is automatically generated, and I'm not interested in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trying to come up with test cases for that, if that is even possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in every case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, and no. Exceptions for parsing you want to cover right? People
</I>&gt;<i> forget that a good regression test for a parser is also to test what it
</I>&gt;<i> does with incorrect input - good and expected message vs &quot;Null pointer
</I>&gt;<i> exception at....&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
In this particular case, I'm parsing poker hand histories, i.e. text files
generated by the poker client. They are correct by definition, so exceptions
only happen when I have problems with my handling of the files.

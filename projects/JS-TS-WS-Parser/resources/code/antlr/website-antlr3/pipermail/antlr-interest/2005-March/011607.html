<PRE> I agree, though a plugin to what? How exactly is the instrumentation
supposed to happen (Ter?)? I assume it will be through custom code
generators extending the base ones to add debug functionality? So, will
these be provided by Antlr or will the IDE be responsible for hooking in
it's own debug generators? And then how will it divide between core
Antlr and code-gens? Presumably some mix is needed. Code-gen needs to
provide language-specific debug calls, but implementing entire debug
system would be troublesome, so ideally core Antlr would be doing
something, building on smaller units specified by code-gen (perhaps just
low-level call-message stuff, perhaps higher, allowing C# to spit out
conditional methods for debug builds might be nice). And then the IDE
seems to need some place in the whole thing, to specify whether it wants
to be doing in-process (for a target-language it can host) or net based
otherwise for instance.

Tom.

I would really prefer the transport mechanism to be a plugin. This would
allow socket-based transport if desired, or direct observer
communication.
No need to do network I/O if not necessary.

The plugin would be responsible for the unicast/multicast support.

That said, an implementation in Eclipse would need to use socket-based
communication ;) I'm just thinking of a command-line version similar to
ParseView, which simply adds listeners.

Later,

</I>&gt;<i> No, the Antlr GUI, written in Java, or other GUIs in any language, 
</I>&gt;<i> will be able to debug parsers in any target language.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Terrence Parr said:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;That Java interface is just the Java way to trigger events.  
</I>&gt;<i> C or whatever would just call functions that emitted a text protocol 
</I>&gt;<i> across the socket to the GUI (which happens to be in Java, though 
</I>&gt;<i> that's not important...anybody that wants to will be able to handle 
</I>&gt;<i> the protocol).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, I'll be defining a very simple text language (protocol) for 
</I>&gt;<i> anybody that knows how to open sockets to use.&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps I missed it in this thread, but is the V3.0 debug interface 
</I>&gt;<i> intended only for Java?  It seems that quite a bit of the discussion 
</I>&gt;<i> is in that context, so need to ask.

<PRE>Part 2 of my reply .....

&gt;<i>Unless
</I>&gt;<i> you have a very slow machine or very low RAM causing swapping, this should
</I> &gt; be pretty much unnoticeable.

I have a 2.4 ghz processor and 512 mb ram and believe me my
incremental parser is FAST. all my tests are standalone swt apps so
they take like 6 mb in mem max. But still i notice sluggishness if i
run it on every keystroke.


Also eclipse has insanely complex code in ALL its ui elements to
handle those deltas.
Look at the outline view for example. They had to almost completly
reimplement that tree view to make it NOT work on domain objects.

Same goes for stuff like folding and semantic highlighting.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now if you are going to update all these things on every single

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And mind you if you don't run the parser on every keystroke, then you
</I>&gt;<i> are limiting its power to as good as a batch parser.
</I>&gt;<i> Hell, a batch parser also takes jsut arnd 30 ms to parse a 10,0000
</I>&gt;<i> line file, and we are going to be updating after say 500ms anyway, so
</I>&gt;<i> what diff does it make whether we run a batch parser in between or an
</I>&gt;<i> incremental parser.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As you are talking so much about eclipse, well look at the source.
</I>&gt;<i> they run a FULL parse each time, and just get the deltas of the diff
</I>&gt;<i> between 2 asts.
</I>&gt;<i> They DONT have an incremental parser.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Take a look at 'JavaSourceViewerConfiguration', in the getReconciler()
</I>&gt;<i> method. Hell even the reconciler there is not incremental. There
</I>&gt;<i> stands no question of incremental parsing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They just do incremental compilation, for which they anyway have to
</I>&gt;<i> parse the full file, and as its done only each time you save, the
</I>&gt;<i> little slowness does not get noticed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So here is my problem stated once again -
</I>&gt;<i> You can't run an incremental parser on every keystroke cause no matter
</I>&gt;<i> how fast the parser is, the amount of 'other' stuff to update will
</I>&gt;<i> slow the editor.
</I>&gt;<i> If you can't run the parser on each keystroke, the incremental parser
</I>&gt;<i> is as good as a batch parser cause the time interval you are gonna run
</I>&gt;<i> it in, you can run the batch parser 10 times in it anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So what's the use of an incremental parser.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also i was looking at this blog of the guy who handles intellisense in
</I>&gt;<i> visual studio. even they don't run their parser on each keystroke,
</I>&gt;<i> cause it will be too slow.
</I>&gt;<i> And eclipse is not fast! its just that parsing is not that slow after all ;)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I guess I'll come back to eclipse anyway. I've never noticed it stopping me

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seconds for a large build (due to some validation weirdness in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; webtools), but even that's minimal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure if eclipse is totally rebuilding the ast each time or not (it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; may be). I'm working on a plugin that filters trivial get/set methods and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; displays an editable table of bean properties (which is why I want the ANTLR
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tree support to be more flexible), and I had it rebuild the ast each time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and it wasn't noticeable to me. (In other words, the ast build was getting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; called at least twice per refresh; once by eclipse, once by me. However,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; eclipse may be caching it and detecting changes so it can simply return it).

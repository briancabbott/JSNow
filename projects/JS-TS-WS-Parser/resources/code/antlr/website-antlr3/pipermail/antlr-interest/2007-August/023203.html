By normal definitions, a &quot;list&quot; could either be a &quot;linked list&quot; or 
a &quot;vector&quot;; either way it's logically unkeyed (though frequently 
they are implicitly keyed by their position in the 
collection).  So for a &quot;list&quot; I think everyone would expect the 
behaviour that if you deleted item #1 then item #2 would &quot;move&quot; to 
become the new item #1.  (Which is not what it does right now.)

I imagine hashtables could still be useful in some places (eg. the 
string factory), but I suspect most of the public stuff should 
probably be dealing with lists.

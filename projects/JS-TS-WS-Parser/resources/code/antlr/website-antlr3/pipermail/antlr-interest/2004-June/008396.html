<PRE>IF your stuff is just an array, look at RobC's MaVerick compiler and see
if you want to &quot;borrow&quot; some of his &quot;dynamic array&quot; code.

It wouldn't be that fast, because it would store everything in one big
string, unless you optimised it ...

It wouldn't suprise me in the slightest if I've completely misunderstood
what you're trying to do, but if &quot;storing n-dimensional arrays in a hash
table&quot; sounds like it would solve your problem, then talk to Rob and me.
Where n can change dynamically to be whatever value just happens to be
convenient at that moment in time :-) And there's a good chance Monty
will chime in and say &quot;Oh I get it&quot;, too :-)

Cheers,
Wol

Subject: [antlr-interest] StringTemplate enhancement question

To anyone playing with StringTemplate...

First, good news.  The use of StringTemplate 2.0b1 in my ANTLR 3.0 code 
generator is a truly a joy.

Next, I have a problem.  Recall that the distinguishing characteristic 
of ST is that it strictly enforces separation of model and view; that 
is, your view literally cannot become part of the program.  This 
manifests itself in, for example, the ANTLR code generator as a 
guarantee that the CodeGenerator object is truly language-independent 
and consequently ANTLR should be easily retargetable.  Literally every 
character that goes out to the generated Java file comes from a 
template; no literals in the CodeGenerator. :)

Ok, on to my desired enhancement...

I often have lists of things that need to be formatted, but the list 
items are actually pieces of data that are not already in an object.  I 
need ST to do something like:

Ter=3432
Tom=32234
....

using template:

$items:{$attr.name$=$attr.type$}$

This example will call getName() on the objects in items attribute, but 
what if they aren't objects?  I have perhaps two parallel arrays 
instead of a single array of objects containing two fields.  One 
solution is allow Maps to be handled like properties so that attr.name 
would fail getName() but then see that it's a Map and do 
attr.get(&quot;name&quot;) instead.

This very clean approach is espoused by some, but the problem is that 
it's a hole in my separation rules.  People can put the logic in the 
view because you could say: &quot;go get bob's data&quot; in the view:

Bob's Phone: $db.bob.phone$

A view should not be part of the program and hence should never be able 
to go ask for a specific person's data.  Humor me that it's good to be 
ruthless (or read my paper &lt;snicker&gt;).  Is there another way to fake 
aggregates by given separate pieces of data to ST and have it 
aggregate?

Well, first I tried passing in

new Object() {
   public String getName() {return &quot;Ter&quot;;}
   public String getType() {return &quot;234&quot;;}
}

But it complains that the damn anonymous class is not public :(  
Bastards!  Those things suck.

So, what about something like:

     st.setAttribute(&quot;items.name&quot;, &quot;Ter&quot;);
     st.setAttribute(&quot;items.type&quot;, &quot;342&quot;);

But that isn't quite it.  How does ST know when to make a new items 
object in the list versus setting a prop within the last item added or 
whatever.  Or, what about a new method:

     st.setupAttribute(&quot;items.name&quot;, &quot;Ter&quot;);
     st.setupAttribute(&quot;items.type&quot;, &quot;342&quot;);
     st.nextAttribute();

er something?

Seems like the various pieces could go in together like this:

     st.setAttribute(&quot;tokens.name,type&quot;, new Object[] {&quot;Ter&quot;,&quot;342&quot;});

which is weird, but would work.  I'd have to parse the attribute name a 
bit and pull apart stuff to make a little hashtable out of name/type.  
I suppose I could pass two arrays: one for the names and one for the 
values.  Ick.  Could do this I suppose:

     st.setAttribute(&quot;tokens&quot;, new Object[]
{&quot;name&quot;,&quot;Ter&quot;,&quot;type&quot;,&quot;342&quot;});

Just intersperse the keys with the values.  gross ;)

A final option.  Believe it or not, due to the wacky init {...} syntax 
for anon inner classes, this would work too:

     st.setAttribute(&quot;tokens&quot;, new HashMap() {{put(&quot;name&quot;,&quot;Ter&quot;); 
put(&quot;type&quot;,&quot;342&quot;);}});

The double {{ }} would be required.  That is, the following code

HashMap m = new HashMap() {{put(&quot;name&quot;,&quot;Ter&quot;); put(&quot;type&quot;,&quot;342&quot;);}};
System.out.println(m);

prints

{type=342, name=Ter}

Again, though, how do I prevent people from passing in a regular 
HashMap that is actually just a proxy for their DB?  Then the view 
could do DB accesses!  Oh, I could make a special object that worked 
like a HashMap, but which wouldn't allow subclasses so people couldn't 
sneak in a modified version that was actually a database.

Which would you choose?  Anybody have some insight?

<PRE>The thing that caused me to switch away from ANTLR syntax
is because I prefer the tree building syntax of JJTree that always
create imaginary nodes instead of a mix of both.  And it mostly
avoid having to create nodes within actions.

Most other things are just a matter of personal taste.

Chris.

</I>&gt;<i> Welcome!  The performance differential is not a surprise--that's 
</I>&gt;<i> sort of an artifact of ANTLR 2's history.  Ter was too busy with 
</I>&gt;<i> jGuru to do much polishing.  That should change with ANTLR 3, which 
</I>&gt;<i> will be a major upgrade, both in terms of features and 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've looked over the LLK source, and can see that you have 
</I>&gt;<i> incorporated design features from several other language translation 
</I>&gt;<i> tools.  I'm curious:  why did you choose the LLK syntax?  It is not 
</I>&gt;<i> what I would have chosen.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi, this is Chris Leung, author of LLK. I am just one of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; many to write open source software to kill time (somebody may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mistaken that as xxx ms).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for all the interest in LLK.  LLK is started as I explore
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; several design alternatives while I study ANTLR. It turns out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to have some worthwhile features and improvements.  So I released
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the code and hope that would be useful for others.  I would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; most glad if anything in LLK would be useful for ANTLR.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To be honest, I am no expert in this field. LLK is started as a 
</I>&gt;<i> hack
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of ANTLR. The basic algorithm is same as ANTLR.  But as more and 
</I>&gt;<i> more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; feature and implementation differences comes in, it is almost
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a complete rewrite. Most of the differences from ANTLR are 
</I>&gt;<i> explained
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the LLK documentation at llk.sourceforge.net.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I ran some preliminary test (with GnuCParser) and found that it 
</I>&gt;<i> (LLK
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; v0.1) is about 4-5 times faster than ANTLR 2.7.2 (in Java). But I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have not dig too deep into it yet. I would certainly be glad to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discuss any specific issues about LLK.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Chris.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;  Maybe it could be

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Great! :)  Let's see if he likes the LL-regular.  I wonder who

<PRE>Some quick comments:

1.)  ANTLR will be going Open Source soon, so in the long term there will be a solution.

2.)  For C# code generation--Addi's concern--there are a limited number of developers (and of people who contributed patches), the 
development is all recent (within 2 years), and one of the principal developers (Micheal Jor) is active in this group.  I doubt that it would 
take much time for Addi's lawyers to contact all contributors.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; From my understanding (and of course I maybe wrong), but I believe our

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; is genuinely meant to be for Open Source (without charging anything

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; the ANTLR community). Not sure what the outcome of it has been or
</I>&gt;<i> whether
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; it has been accepted. But regardless, ANTLR does not need to hire
</I>&gt;<i> lawyers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; all they need to do is to ask one of the comapnie's that is using (or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; wanted to use) the ANTLR runtime library to provide them with the
</I>&gt;<i> proper
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; licensing agreement and advice (after all it would be in the company's
</I>&gt;<i> own
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; interest).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; FYI: Regretfully as it stands and as of today we have been told that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; decision NOT to use ANTLR is final since the current licensing agreement
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; leaves the corporation with potential law suits and liabilities in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; future, and therefore we have to re-architect our product using other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; alternatives.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You did see my suggestion of adding a custom codegenerator to antlr and an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; own support lib ? As long as you don't have to ship the antlr tool itself
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this looks a valid option to me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A manager would have to be seriously stupid not to consider that option
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; since retargetting a codegenerator for antlr is a lot less work than the 6
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; months work you guys spent in making your current parser. A small
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; calculation in costs will of course turn this in something even an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; accountant can understand...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ric
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok , As far as I can see , we here can use ANTLR quite safely for our
</I>&gt;<i> internal needs ,
</I>&gt;<i> but we will have to move to other tools if we plan to distribute our
</I>&gt;<i> internal tools :
</I>&gt;<i> Are other people coming to the same conclusion ? I came to Ric suggestion

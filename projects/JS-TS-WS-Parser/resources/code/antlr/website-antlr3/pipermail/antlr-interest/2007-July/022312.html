<PRE>I actually have a different take on this. Ter made sure that the
concepts of the book worked. This essentially created a systematic
mechanism to make ANTLR3 stable for some class of tasks. This is enough
of a reason for me to be grateful for the book.

 

And yes, I bought the book for the same reason as you did. I am even
using antlr for the same reason that you are (I don't like debugging
yacc rules).

Subject: Re: [antlr-interest] about the book

 


  I've used ANTLR for two graph query language projects at Lawrence
Livermore National
Lab.  I've used ANTLR for other projects before this, including for a
Java compiler front
end.

  I absolutely agree with Lloyd.  I just bought the book and I don't
care whether it's useful 
or not.  It does happen to be useful, but if it were not I'd still buy
it just to support Terence
and ANTLR.  The fact that I'll never have to use YACC again puts me
deeply in Terence's 
debt.  

  So many thanks, Terence.  And rock on!

I saw there was a controversy about the price / usefulness / etc...

 

I have nothing special about that, except it make me aware that: there
was a book!

 

Taking it as both: 

- a nice and affordable way to support this excellent (free) tool I love
to use (very) occasionnaly

- perhaps a better way to graps some concept which eluded me so far

 

I decided to buy it.

 

 

I'm reading the PDF so far (the dead trees are on their way).

 

 

I just wanted to say that, unlike some comment I previously read, I
found the book very helpful.

Right now I'm reading the chapter on trees. A topic which I was just
barely able to make work/hack before and understanding is now slowly
dawning on me.

 

Of course I have to made an intellectual effort to get the concepts (as
it would be the same for any math/physics/algorithm book). But nowhere
before I had such clear and helpful help.

 

 

So far (from only 20 pages of reading), I will say kudos for the ANTLR
book!!!

(And ANTLR Works as well, of course, with which I could experiment the
gramatical structure and quickly and easily double check if I got the
concept right)

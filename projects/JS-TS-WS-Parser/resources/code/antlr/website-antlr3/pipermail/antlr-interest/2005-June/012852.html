Interesting.  That is effectively a getParent.

Yes, and in most nicely structured cases just the one above.

</I>
Now we are back to custom data structures to hold what the tree already 
holds.  Further, context may need to be determined not by the entire set of 
prior rules/nodes -- some could be irrelevant or, worse, misleading as to 
the correct context.  So, either I work through this custom stack and with 
a bunch of custom code to worry out the details of the context or I define 
a tree-walker that automatically recognizes the relevant nodes and, in a 
nicely structured manner, identifies context.  Seems like the latter would 
be the best use of the strengths of ANTLR.

Your node pointer idea may provide a workable alternative.  If, from a 
current node, I can adequately guess which is the applicable context 
defining start node, I can just start the context-recognition tree-walker 
there, terminating on the current node.  Still, the only certainty as to 
current context logically requires starting the context-recognition 
tree-walker in reverse from the current node.

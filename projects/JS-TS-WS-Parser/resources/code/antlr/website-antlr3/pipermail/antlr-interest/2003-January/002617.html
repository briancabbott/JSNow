<PRE>
&gt;<i> &gt; I am a total ANTLR TreeParser newbie. Having read the docs again, 
</I>I felt
&gt;<i> &gt; that Resolvers and SymbolTale population are things that it 
</I>should be
&gt;<i> &gt; possible for a TreeParser to do. Am I right or have I missed 
</I>something
&gt;<i> &gt; fundamentally?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That sounds like a tautology...
</I>
Perhaps not to a treeparser newbie?  ;-)

&gt;<i> Sure, you can walk a tree and gather whatever information is 
</I>available from
&gt;<i> the tree.
</I>
OK.

&gt;<i> The trick is to build the initial AST with sufficient 
</I>information. :-)
&gt;<i> A canonical example seems to be mapping back to the source with 
</I>position
&gt;<i> information.
</I>
Isn't this a Lexer issue?. Ensuring the info is captured by the lexer 
in the first place?

&gt;<i> Remember that you can:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	* make multiple passes over the tree
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	* transform the tree into &quot;better&quot; trees
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	* create auxiliary structues that you thread through the tree
</I>
An example would be?

&gt;<i> &gt; If there are examples of resolvers etc written as ANTLR tree 
</I>parsers, I'd
&gt;<i> &gt; appreciate a link/sample.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this context, what do you mean by &quot;resolvers&quot;?
</I>
A processing entity that traverses an AST and links ID nodes to their 
defining occurences, resolving overloads and expression types. [Might 
make mutiple traversals.]

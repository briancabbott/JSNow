For the time being I think exceptions are the way to go. It helps us  
to identify problems much more quickly. But I agree that a final  
version shouldn't fail in that way if at all reasonable. OTOH if it  
really is an exception, then why not. At the end of the day, this is  
a tool for programmers who mostly understand what's going on. That  
doesn't mean that they know the reason for the particular exception,  
but instead that there is a problem which should mandate a bug report :)

In most cases I've come across, it is due to some missing template/ 
attribute. Clearly, there isn't much ANTLR can do in those cases,  
it's just going to fail.

cheers,

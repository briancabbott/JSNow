<PRE>
I am writing an ANTLR parser for a language developed by my firm. As 
in any languages this is also changing over time and some old syntax 
will have to be ruled out. I though a solution to this problem would 
be to print a deprecated message each time the &quot;old&quot; syntax is found, 
and by doing this give the users some time to remove them.
Since the files with the language syntax can easily be on several 
thousand lines, I would like to print the line number at the same 
time. I have however not succeeded to find any description to 
retrieve the line number from the parser; I guess it must be there 
somewhere since the exceptions that are thrown contain this 
information.

Any help will be appreciated!

Best regards,

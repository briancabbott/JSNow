<PRE>An intriguing problem. I did not expect this work in PHP, and if the PHP was
intended to be processable as XML it would be invalid, as the markup tags
would cease to be processing instructions. PHP authors are usually
encouraged to do &lt;? echo(&quot;?&quot;.&quot;&gt;&quot;); ?&gt; or similar. I have a feeling ASP is
simpler, with the tags being processed before the source code is parsed,
because ASP allows multiple languages it has to work differently.

So it seems like the PHP processor behaves as if it starts in HTML mode, and
transforms (incrementally) everything up to &quot;&lt;?&quot; into what behaves like an
echo statement. It then drops into PHP mode and parses (again incrementally)
until it hits &quot;?&gt;&quot; where it would accept a statement terminator, switching
back into HTML and repeating. This is not at all what I had expected, and
implies all sorts of problems mixing JSP/ASP and PHP anyway, as JSP is
implemented as a rewrite, more or less. 

This processing model implies that PHP may need to be the &quot;root&quot; grammar,
with the HTML elements handed off to other grammars if and when needed.
Other grammars can be identified (partly!) by the tags, but &lt;% ... %&gt; can be
Java, JavaScript, VB, even Perl. I haven't tested any of these awkward cases
(such as Perl's heredoc) but I would guess (And it is a guess) that it is
PHP that is the oddity here. 

I've started to look at Pygments as a solution to doing code highlighting.
It does not parse deeply, but for segmenting stuff and handing things off
between different languages, particularly PHP/HTML/JSP/ASP, it works well.
However, it would be confused by this example. 

All the best
Stuart

You could probably get pretty far just by handling strings, comments &amp;
escape sequences for each embedded language.

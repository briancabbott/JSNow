</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We could make that argument for any of Antlr's features, most of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which take
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a lot more processing and memory than just a couple of ints. If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; speed is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only reason for not providing the intuitive functionality, then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ways to architect it so that it only gets invoked for users who need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; functionality (IoC is one, but there are others).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which features are there that take a lot of memory based on the input?
</I>&gt;<i> Apart from line information (which most of the time I don't &quot;really&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> need to have stored, I can re-lex on error to produce the necessary
</I>&gt;<i> information because an error will be expensive anyway), all I can see
</I>&gt;<i> in CommonToken (for Java now) is necessary housekeeping information.
</I>&gt;<i> E.g. the start/stop indices are used to grab the actual text from the
</I>&gt;<i> input stream, rather than copying strings around.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm just saying that adding a column and the tab-width handling
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't make that much sense, because it's not something you generally
</I>&gt;<i> need. If you do need it, it's almost trivial to add.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Even in managed languages, an integer field only takes 4 or 8 bytes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (There
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is no need to allocate an entirely separate object for each character
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; position.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's certainly not the case for reference counted (and weakly typed)
</I>&gt;<i> languages like Perl. I believe Python uses the same approach as Perl
</I>&gt;<i> (opaque structs that store multiple representations of their value
</I>&gt;<i> internally, converting when necessary).
</I>&gt;<i> At least Perl uses way more than 4 bytes per int on a 32bit machine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, I meant tokens not characters here. I agree it would be silly to
</I>&gt;<i> wrap each char in an object. But if you have a huge number of short
</I>&gt;<i> tokens, this get's noticeable.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, for short input it hardly makes any sense to even think
</I>&gt;<i> about it...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I think the runtime should be minimal, because it's much easier to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; add
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; functionality than to remove it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's a valid point.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And what Antlr already provides (an accurate line and character pos)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is already good. But most editors display a 1-based column number. So
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if the intent is to provide the grammar developer accurate feedback in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; order to quickly locate the problem, then an accurate 1-based column
</I>number
&gt;<i> &gt; should be provided.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is tab handling, otherwise I'd not argue about 0 vs 1.
</I>&gt;<i> Letting it start at 1 kinda implies that we are telling the &quot;column&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> even when we are not. It's not a column and can't be in the presence
</I>&gt;<i> of tabs. Hence my fierce arguments ;)
</I>
I see.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When using Vi, it is easy to go to a line#/character offset. But
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Eclipse
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (without the Vi plugin) doesn't allow you to move the right n
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; characters. It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just displays the column number, which varies with the spaces-per-tab
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; setting. Editor plugins, such as AntlrDT probably already take this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; account.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But most users probably think that column #1 means the first
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; character, not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the 2nd.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I talk about column 1, then yes, I mean the first character. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> human after all.
</I>&gt;<i> But when I see charPosInLine, I think index (in c-speak).
</I>
Yes. Whereas vertical tabs are no longer used, the Antlr &quot;line&quot; attribute is
1-based, but the horizontal coordinate, &quot;charPosInLine&quot; is 0-based (for
reasons you've described in detail). Maybe it would have been clearer with a
name like &quot;charIndex&quot;.

Nevertheless, the question seems to be one of whether it is worthwhile to
handle tabs as a special case, and I hear you voting, &quot;no.&quot;


&gt;<i> Actually, I think we need better error messages in the default
</I>&gt;<i> implementation, then the problem goes away.
</I>&gt;<i> Naturally this won't happen in 3.1 (as it's been released! hooray!),
</I>&gt;<i> but maybe we can cook up something for 3.2.
</I>&gt;<i> Note: I'm not talking about solving the tab problem, but displaying a
</I>&gt;<i> short portion of the input (whether charstream or tokenstream) with an
</I>&gt;<i> indicator where the offending char/token was. That should make it easy
</I>&gt;<i> to find the error, even if we can't provide column-accurate position
</I>&gt;<i> info out of the box.
</I>&gt;<i> That above plan applies to other error messages as well:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> warning(200): MySQL51.g:1610:74: Decision can match input such as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;MINUS&quot; using multiple alternatives: 1, 2
</I>&gt;<i> As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input
</I>
Yes. You're right. Cut to the chase and just give the offending input,
rather than make the user go search for it.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to see more verbose information about which alternatives were
</I>&gt;<i> involved because counting them in the input grammar can be really
</I>&gt;<i> tiring (if the alts are 15,34 for example).
</I>
Again, excellent suggestion.


&gt;<i> ANTLRWorks helps here, but sometimes I want to see it in the actual
</I>&gt;<i> output. Shouldn't be hard to add in any case.
</I>
AntlrWorks has it's issues. It's difficult to rely on it, unless it is being
actively supported. (Are bugs being actively addressed in AntlrWorks?) 

I agree with you that more descriptive error messages are needed and would
probably solve most issues without resorting to character counting, anyway.

<PRE>I'm all for it. At this point, Stack Overflow is a proven system for the 
question and answer(s) format. If you love email notifications, you can 
subscribe to the antlr tag. I'd prefer to add the antlr tag rss feed to 
Google Reader to follow along with current events, and subscribe to 
specific questions that interest me. Seems like a more flexible option 
than this mailing list, and it's probably a step in the right direction.

</I>&gt;<i> Basically, I'm trying to reduce my system administration load. I've turned off p4 in favor of github and have turned off jira in favor of github's bug tracker.  I tried to move the confluence wiki to the on demand service, but I'm not sure it's ready for prime time yet so I backed off.

</I>&gt;<i> Moving to that website has a lot of advantages over an old-school mailing list, if you've ever used it. You can also treat it like a mailing list by asking for events when someone posts an antlr-tagged posting. It's set up very nicely for question-and-answer. It's also easier for people to post a question because they don't have to sign up for our mailing list. there is a good chance that they will have an account already at stackoverflow.com

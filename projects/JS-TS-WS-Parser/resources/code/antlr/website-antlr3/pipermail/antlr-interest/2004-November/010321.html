Well, just to clarify things and make your point more clear, which (might be 
no GPPL -- I 100% agree that typically they are bad) language you like then? 
Or which one is closest to your likings, or at list a step in right 
direction? Or what your ideal language be look like?

1963 Lisp macros revisisted ;) ?

</I>
This all (LOP) looks nice at first glance but there are big problems sitting 
in there. First of the being the fast that definig a DSL is not that easy 
task --  doing it right requires above average competence. The author slides 
easily over that (fig. 2 lacks one important thing long ------&gt; for creating 
proper DSL).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example, look at the continuing evolution of &quot;aspect oriented
</I>&gt;<i> programming&quot; -- they are trying to backfit the ability to create and
</I>&gt;<i> manipulate (higher-level) languages on top of the existing GPPLs.  As their
</I>&gt;<i> ad hoc approach continues to run into more and more fundamental problems,
</I>&gt;<i> they continue to try to increase the power of their approach -- alas,
</I>&gt;<i> mostly through more ad hoc measures (conventions, etc.).
</I>
Most of that AOP looks like (and IMHO in fact is) just a &quot;higher order hack&quot;.

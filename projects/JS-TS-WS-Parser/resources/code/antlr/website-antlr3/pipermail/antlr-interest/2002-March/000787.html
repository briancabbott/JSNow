I'm already working on the 2.7.2a2 port Eric. Along with an updated 
2.7.1 using ideas from the work you were kind enough to share. I'm 
trying to ensure that the debugging stuff is also supported for C#.

&gt;<i> I'd really like to make this easier in the future somehow, 
</I>&gt;<i> but the code generator and runtime currently don't lend 
</I>&gt;<i> themselves to anything but a complete re-port.  I've got some 
</I>&gt;<i> ideas but they're all a tremendous up-front effort for some 
</I>&gt;<i> possible time savings in the future.  Kind of a hard sell, 
</I>&gt;<i> even to myself.
</I>
Perhaps if you elaborate?. I must admt I gave up on any big re-orgs 
until I'm more familiar with Antlr's internals.

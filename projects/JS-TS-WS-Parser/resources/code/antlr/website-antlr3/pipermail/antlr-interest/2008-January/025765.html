 &gt;I mean the runtime. My team signs all the assemblies that we
 &gt;emit.  That requires all the references to be signed as well.
 &gt;This is the only reason (at least so far) for me to go with
 &gt;3.1 even though it is still not released.

Whenever you're faced with an assembly you want to use that isn't 
signed, you could always just sign it yourself.  The process is a 
little fiddly (you have to disassemble and reassemble the 
assembly, since you can sign only as part of compilation), but it 
works.  Just bear in mind that self-signed third-party assemblies 
probably shouldn't be put into the GAC.

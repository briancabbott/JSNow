<PRE>This approach was borrowed right from Terence's book, page 187. He even stated that it looked odd, but made sense - explanation follows.&#160;Anyway, I tested it. With rewrite like (multExpr -&gt; multExpr) it works as expected, without it does not.
&#160;
The point is that I need binary tree. Rewrite like:
&#160;
multExpr
&#160;: primaryExpr ((o='*' | o='/') e=primaryExpr -&gt; ^($o $e) )*
&#160;;
&#160;
or:

multExpr
&#160;: (primaryExpr -&gt; primaryExpr) ( (o='*' | o='/') e=primaryExpr -&gt; ^($o $multExpr $e) )*
&#160;;
&#160;
produces desired default AST binary tree. Just how modify it so it builds my binary tree...
I cannot figure this out.
&#160;
Thanks,
&#160;
Tomasz

Well, you don't need &quot;-&gt; primaryExpr&quot; in the first subrule there - it's implicit. To make your tree nodes binary only, I don't think you can use EBNF like that, I think you'll need to use recursion. After all, you want

3 + 2 - 4

to produce a tree like

&#160;&#160;&#160;+
&#160; / \
3&#160;&#160;&#160;-
&#160; &#160; / \
&#160;&#160;&#160;2&#160;&#160;&#160;4

(Whether the - or + is at the root doesn't matter)

I don't think this is possible with just EBNF constructs. You need it to parse 2-4 as an expression that produces a subtree, and that expression be picked up by the match of the + operator. Alternatively, you could produce a non-binary tree like

&#160; &#160; +
&#160;&#160;&#160;/|\
&#160; 3 2 -4

Because subtraction is associative, this is viable. Same for multiplication/division, with&#160; '/ a' becoming '* a^-1', if you care to model them via inverses as is typical in group/ring theory in mathematics. Personally, I think a binary tree is cleaner, but you have to do something much cleverer than normal EBNF to produce that, AFAICT.

&gt;<i> I would think that now I can simply replace:
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; ^($o $addExpr $e)
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; ^(BIN_EXPR&lt;BinaryExpression&gt;[o.text, $addExpr.tree, $e.tree]&gt;)
</I>&gt;<i>&#160; - but not. $addExpr.tree in the second version is always NIL.
</I>
Well, $addExpr is the result of the current parser rule, as that expression appears to appear in the addExpr: rule. Of course it's going to produce odd results.

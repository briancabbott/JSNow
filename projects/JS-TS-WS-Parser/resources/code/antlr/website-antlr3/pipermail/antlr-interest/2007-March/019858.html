<PRE>Actually, I did fix the problem you reported and I emailed you to tell
you that it was fixed. Your problem was that when action code was in the
lexer rule the declarations were out of order. This is different - you
cannot DECLARE variables in @init.

 &gt;MSVS 2005 compiler can not compiler it since &quot;char c; int o;&quot;
 &gt;declarations are placed after executable statements. This
 &gt;restriction was relazed in C99 standart which is unfortunately
 &gt;is not supported even in MSVS 2005 in its C-mode. Trying to
 &gt;compile in C++ mode causes other problems in other places,
 &gt;so usage of C++ mode is not a solution here.

I reported this one a couple of months back, but sadly it still 
doesn't seem to have been fixed.

I did work around it by compiling in C++ mode, though, although it 
required adding a lot of extern &quot;C&quot; blocks.  But really the 
codegen templates need to get fixed.  Or we need to get another 
code-insertion block that inserts at the top of the generated 
function instead of further down.

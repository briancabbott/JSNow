<PRE>   Harald,

   Thanks a lot for your answer. I know it probably took you quite some time
to go through that and answer me, because you captured the exact picture of
how the language is today. Our grammar has several non-LL(*) constructions
that were implemented earlier in its life and now we have to deal with
backward compatibility issues.
   Anyway, the change I tried to introduce in the grammar was allowing user
defined identifiers (ID token) followed by an optional [] to be used as an
operator. This is to allow things like:

Event( this after[1,10] anotherEvent )

   Where &quot;after&quot; is a user defined operator and 1,10 are parameters to it.
Anyway, I know that introducing an identification token (like '~') makes the
grammar work, but users don't want that.

Event( this ~after[1,10] anotherEvent )

  So we will have to either have all possible operators hardcoded in the
grammar (as Lexer tokens) or have the users to accept the addition of an
identification token.

   Thanks a lot for your feedback.

   Edson


I know that using a token to identify such operators

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Edson -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I looked into your grammar and played with it a little ... that language
</I>&gt;<i> is more or less a horror story.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Essentially, you can say things like
</I>&gt;<i>     a == 5 &amp;&amp; c != 6
</I>&gt;<i> but also
</I>&gt;<i>     a == 5 &amp;&amp; != 6
</I>&gt;<i> (without the c) and then there are operators that may be names, so you can
</I>&gt;<i> say
</I>&gt;<i>      a == 5 &amp;&amp; c 6
</I>&gt;<i> (meaning probably a == 5 &amp;&amp; a c 6, where c is some user-defined operator);
</I>&gt;<i> and then you can have those brackets as in
</I>&gt;<i>     a[3] == 5 &amp;&amp; b[3] == 6
</I>&gt;<i> but an operator can ALSO have brackets, so you can have
</I>&gt;<i>      a[3] == 5 &amp;&amp; b[3] 6
</I>&gt;<i> (meaning probably a[3] == 5 &amp;&amp; a b[3] 6 - whatever the operator b[3] is
</I>&gt;<i> meant to be ...) as well as
</I>&gt;<i>      a[3] == 5 &amp;&amp; b[3] c[2] 6
</I>&gt;<i> where now the b[3] is a path and c[2] is the operator.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The grammar tries to find a way thru this by having { backtracking=true; }
</I>&gt;<i> options in it - but I fear that hte graphs of the LL(*) analysis and the {
</I>&gt;<i> backtracking=true; } don't always work the way they are supposed to: Either
</I>&gt;<i> because ANTLR simply won't be able to do everything, or because there is
</I>&gt;<i> some tiny flaw in the grammar so that there's really no way to parse some of
</I>&gt;<i> the constructs.
</I>&gt;<i> When you remove the { backtracking=true; } around line 85 (I edited the
</I>&gt;<i> file a few times, so that number may be off), ANTLR tells you
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     error(211): DRL2.g:88:3: [fatal] rule and_restr_connective has
</I>&gt;<i> non-LL(*) decision due to recursive rule invocations reachable from alts
</I>&gt;<i> 1,2.  Resolve by left-factoring or using syntactic predicates or using
</I>&gt;<i> backtrack=true option.
</I>&gt;<i>     warning(200): DRL2.g:88:3: Decision can match input such as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;DOUBLE_AMPER LEFT_PAREN {LEFT_PAREN, NOT, '=='..'!='}&quot; using multiple
</I>&gt;<i> alternatives: 1, 2
</I>&gt;<i>     As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, this definitely is a horrible thing - a grammar that is &quot;not at all
</I>&gt;<i> LL(*).&quot; ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would argue that the only way to &quot;repiar&quot; this machinery is to have only
</I>&gt;<i> one level of nested expressions, so that eg. DOUBLE_AMPER is only at one
</I>&gt;<i> place in the grammar. The core rule for a simple expression might be
</I>&gt;<i> something like
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     simpleexpression:    path? operator value
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> where path is defined in some LL(k) (or LL(*) way) so that it is possible
</I>&gt;<i> to decide whether there is path. One step further, one could try
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      simpleexpression
</I>&gt;<i>         : (path)=&gt; path operator value
</I>&gt;<i>         | operator value
</I>&gt;<i>         ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I may also be wrong with these suggestions ... only having the full
</I>&gt;<i> thing set up will show what's going on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards &amp; good luck
</I>&gt;<i> Harald

</I>&gt;<i> *Subject:* [antlr-interest] Grammar does not match a valid sentence
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      I have a grammar that is not matching a valid sentence and I don't
</I>&gt;<i> understand exactly why. If anyone can shed some light, I would really
</I>&gt;<i> appreciate.
</I>&gt;<i>      To see the problem:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using: antlr v3.0 and antlrworks 1.1.4:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Load the attached grammar in antlrworks
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Select the interpreter tab and paste the following sentence:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Address( street[1] == &quot;Low&quot; &amp;&amp; street[2] == &quot;High&quot; )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Use the rule &quot;fact&quot; as an entry point to parse the sentence above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      The above sentence is a valid sentence, but it is raising a
</I>&gt;<i> NoViableAltException in the &quot;and_restr_connective&quot; rule, while the expected
</I>&gt;<i> behavior is not to match &quot;and_restr_connective&quot;, but go back in the call
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchy and to match the &quot;and_constr&quot; rule.
</I>&gt;<i>      If you remove the square brackets, the sentence will work fine
</I>&gt;<i> (matching the &quot;and_constr&quot; rule):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Address( street1 == &quot;Low&quot; &amp;&amp; street2 == &quot;High&quot; )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Any idea how can I fix that?
</I>&gt;<i>      Thanks in advance,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      []s

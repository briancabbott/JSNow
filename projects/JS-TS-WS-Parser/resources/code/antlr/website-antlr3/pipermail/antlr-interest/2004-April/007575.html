<PRE>
&gt;<i> Well the C++ stuff truncates to 8 bits whenever it sees fit.
</I>My plan is to not do anything in 16 bits.  Just lex the UTF-8 as a pure 
8-bit stream.  So, so long as the Antlr generator and the generated C++ 
code and the support lib are all 8-bit character clean, I'm home free.

&gt;<i> Note that 2.7.4 will barf out attempts at 16 bit char constants.
</I>Do you mean that 2.7.4 won't allow '\u00BF' but will allow '\277'?  Or 
will 2.7.4 only be upset if the upper byte isn't zero, i.e. '\u2004'?  
(Yes, I'm still on 2.7.3)

&gt;<i> If you trick antlr to make the right bitsets,
</I>Er, is there a known issue with bitsets and 8-bit high characters?

&gt;<i> you may get away by handcoding/modifying the few rules that need to 
</I>&gt;<i> deal with UTF8 multibyte
</I>&gt;<i> sequences.
</I>Actually, the few productions that require interpretation of Unicode 
characters (only allow alphabetics, for example) are complex enough 
that I have a perl program that takes a Unicode set description, 
generates the Antlr rules for matching the set when represented as 
UTF-8 sequences.

&gt;<i> The moment you put the icky bits in nice 8 bit strings you're
</I>&gt;<i> basically homefree except for sorting out the actual lenghts of the 
</I>&gt;<i> text
</I>&gt;<i> etc.
</I>All the literals in our source language have only 7-bit strings, so no 
concern here.  But even if we supported something like U+F7 (the 
division sign, &#247;, UTF-8 encoded as 0xC3 0xB7), then I'd just code the 
literal as &quot;\u00C3\u00B7&quot; or &quot;\303\267&quot;, and let Antlr think it is a 
two-character string.

&gt;<i> You could get away with redefining the strings in antlr to wchars and
</I>&gt;<i> recompiling a hacked version of the support lib to have a bit more 
</I>&gt;<i> 'room'
</I>&gt;<i> to maneuver (sp?). That has been done before with some luck.
</I>&lt;speak voice=&quot;kid from Time Bandits&quot;&gt; No, don't touch it.... wchar is 
EEEEEEVIL! &lt;/speak&gt;

&gt;<i> I commend you if you do it with the current support lib (in both cases 
</I>&gt;<i> ;) )
</I>Any code changes will be coming your way, Ric...

&gt;<i> Might be preferable over reinventing the wheel though. And for me a lot
</I>&gt;<i> quicker to implement stuff (unless there's volunteers out there?).
</I>If (and it is a big if), Antlr wanted to support the idea of &quot;specify a 
parser with a Unicode source  character set, but the generated parser 
reads and parses the UTF-8 encoded stream representation&quot;  I believe 
that I can offer the code that would make this automatic.

For example:
	options { charVocabulary: Unicode-via-UTF-8; }
	...
	ALPHA_OMEGA: &quot;\u0391\u03A9&quot; | &quot;\u03B1\u03C9&quot; ;
	DASHES: '\u2010'..'\u2015' ;

Would internally become:
	options { charVocabulary: '\u0000'..'\u00FF'; }
	...
	ALPHA_OMEGA: &quot;\316\221\316\251&quot; | &quot;\316\261\317\211&quot; ;
	DASHES: '\342' '\200' '\220'..'\225' ;

The only hitch is that the user would have to probably up the value of 
k manually (I don't think I could or want to compute the &quot;correct&quot; new 
value.)  I have an algorithm working that works for these and more 
complicated cases as well. (It handles the XML 1.0 and XML 1.1 name 
productions, which are pretty hairy!)

&gt;<i> And I also wonder what you'll get if you feed the lexer in java mode a
</I>&gt;<i> sequence that contains such a value broken up over two UTF-16 values 
</I>&gt;<i> (that
</I>&gt;<i> for lexer terms should be treated as one!).
</I>Java prior to 1.5 is blissfully unaware.  It will think of a UTF-16 
surrogate pair as two characters.  In 1.5 it will start thinking of the 
type 'char' as UTF-16 code value, not a Unicode char.  Not clear how 
this will affect things, but I doubt they'll break any old APIs.

What this means is that parsers currently built in Antlr really parse 
UTF-16 input, not Unicode.  So if you want to match U+1D11E (Musical 
Symbol G Clef), you have to match the string &quot;\uD834\uDD1E&quot;.

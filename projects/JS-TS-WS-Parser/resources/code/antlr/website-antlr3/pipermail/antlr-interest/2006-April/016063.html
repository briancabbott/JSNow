<PRE>That's fantastic jim, - just what I wanted to hear :)
I think I'll dip my toes in the water, and use the java code until the
c# codegen is done, they're not that different anyway I suppose, its
just to enviroment I was after ;)
Im not bothered by the early access, I've been used to worse hehe! And
the lack of docs is a bit of a pain, but I've been following the
blog's/Ter's mail's so I've got a reasonable idea what the differences
are, so along with the examples I think I'll be ok :)

Thanks!

Rob

</I>&gt;<i>Subject: RE: [antlr-interest] antlr &amp; antlr studio...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Out of interest , how stable is V3?  Does it do everything 
</I>&gt;<i>it says on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the tin yet? :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>I find that you need the occasional work around but that 
</I>&gt;<i>because of the nature of it, if you have produced somethign 
</I>&gt;<i>that works once, it will always work. The lack of documenation 
</I>&gt;<i>at the moment is probably the most difficult thing to surmount 
</I>&gt;<i>but you can piece it all together from teh examples if you are willing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However when it hits VS2005, I'll almost certainly use your 
</I>&gt;<i>C codegen 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> since at least theres a modicum of interop between that and 
</I>&gt;<i>C#..hmm I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wonder if turning on the managed C++ for it would be an 
</I>&gt;<i>option in that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I shall look into this as well as generating a COM interface 
</I>&gt;<i>for the generated code too as plenty of people still need to 
</I>&gt;<i>use this. It might make more sense to use the C++ output for 
</I>&gt;<i>such things but in theory it should all be the same under the 
</I>&gt;<i>hood. Further of course, there is a C# output in in progress 
</I>&gt;<i>(not sure how far along it is), which obviously make the most 
</I>&gt;<i>sense if you are accessing the generated code from C# unless 
</I>&gt;<i>there were some performance penalty. However the generated 
</I>&gt;<i>code is logically efficent so it is only the choices made with 
</I>&gt;<i>the runtime implementation that would have dramatic effects on 
</I>&gt;<i>performance - it seems like everyone involved in code 
</I>&gt;<i>generation knows what they are doing though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>If it is a possiblity I woudl use ANTLR3 now as other than the 
</I>&gt;<i>start up time, while there are potentially bugs in there, they 
</I>&gt;<i>do not matter if you configure your grammar to avoid them and 
</I>&gt;<i>the code you generate works for the task at hand. Future 
</I>&gt;<i>modifications to ANTLR3 don't have to be adoopted until you 
</I>&gt;<i>are ready. Of course, the general patina of Early Access may 
</I>&gt;<i>put many people off but ANTLR3 is close to being 'there' if you ask me.

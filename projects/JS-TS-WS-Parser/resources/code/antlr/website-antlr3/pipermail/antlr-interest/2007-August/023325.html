<PRE>If you have something that has been translated from Java to Python and 
would like to contribute to the free and open source body of translation 
knowledge then here is an opportunity to see your material published 
with credit given to you.

On September 20, 2007 <A HREF="http://www.pyconuk.org/news/">http://www.pyconuk.org/news/</A>  says.
&quot;Translating Java to Python

Johnny Stovall is giving a talk on translating Java into Python code using
state of the art tools. He will explain the tools and show example output. The
ability to translate the many Java public domain programs into Python has great
potential benefit for education, social development and business. Any one who
has experienced Johnny's compulsive presentations will be looking forward to
this one.
&quot;

All kinds of programs translated from source to source using any
technique will be considered.
You can showcase your product 
in this presentation.  Just send some sample Java source and how it has 
translated it into Python.  Some or all of it will be used and will be set up 
on a webpage with a link to <A HREF="http://www.semdesigns.com/">http://www.semdesigns.com/</A> if you desire. 

If you want even more free advertisement then please attach step by step 
instructions showing how much easier it is to do this than with other
techniques and 
an overview or the whole process will be included in this one hour long talk 
that is presently scheduled to follow the extremely popular PyPy talk.

Cordially,
Oouc

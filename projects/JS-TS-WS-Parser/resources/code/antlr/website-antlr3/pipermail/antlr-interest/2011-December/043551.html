<PRE>Hi Terence.


re: ParseTreeVisitor

Thanks for the direct links. Yup, that's exactly what I want.

One caveat. Please don't use the term &quot;Visitor&quot;. That's an overloaded
term. ParseEventListener (or some such) is clear and concise and
familiar.


&gt;<i> With a single decision, I had stripped away 2 large pieces of work: AST
</I>&gt;<i> specification and tree grammar specification.
</I>
Less is more. Good job.


&gt;<i> As Kyle points out, a big benefit of this automatic parse tree construction and listener
</I>&gt;<i> event mechanism is that it renders grammars 100% reusable and retargetable to any
</I>&gt;<i> target programming language.
</I>
Awesome. The power of modular interfaces. My use case is the opposite:
multiple grammars to a single target. I tried and tried to figure out
how to support multiple SQL grammars in a generic manner. As described
upthread, event listener with path expressions was the only tractable
solution I could find.


&gt;<i> Sam Harwell has convinced me to include things like skip in setting channels in
</I>&gt;<i> the lexer with special syntax rather than actions? again we get retargeting.
</I>
Some day I hope to understand what you just said. :)


I'll sit tight with my current solution until v4. Thanks for your hard
work and creativity, Terence. I'm having a lot of fun. (With my gf
teasing me in the background &quot;You're such a geek!&quot;).


Cheers, Jason

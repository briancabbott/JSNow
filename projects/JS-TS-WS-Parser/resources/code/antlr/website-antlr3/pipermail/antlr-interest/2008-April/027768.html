<PRE>Johannes,

&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks. The bug that required C# v2 to fix. I might have to 
</I>&gt;<i> backport 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that specific fix. What was the fix for?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've replaced the reference to csharpTypeInitMap with 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;default(&lt;typeName&gt;)&quot;. If you &quot;backport&quot; this change, then 
</I>&gt;<i> you will only destroy C# 1.0 compatibility for CSharp - which 
</I>&gt;<i> is exactly that what I don't want.
</I>
Understood. The bug was due to the type initialization system implemented in
ANTLR. Nothing to backport then.

&gt;<i> &gt; How is this achieved?. Using any value type without needing 
</I>&gt;<i> a template 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; change I mean...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The use of Nullables to solve (the obvious solution) 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't require a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; new target AFAICT. Just C# v2+.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;default(type)&quot; syntax initializes an object depending on 
</I>&gt;<i> type. For value types, their default constructor is invoked. 
</I>&gt;<i> For reference types, they are set to null. Nullables still 
</I>&gt;<i> leave a hole, which my solution doesn't.
</I>
Cool. This is the cleanest solution for C# v2+ (once C# v1.x compatibility
is no longer important). Didn't think the default ctor was invoked. Thought
default() just initialized value-types to 0 and ref-types to null.

Our working assumption was C# v1.x compatibility in same target so we kept
the ANTLR type init system. We investigated nullables as a means to support
both C# v1.x and v2.x+ in the same target (using preprocessor directives to
support differences in syntax) but didn't do any more in available time.

&gt;<i> &gt; YAGNI?. We can agree to differ about Token's utility. It's 
</I>&gt;<i> easy enough 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to retain it locally here in any case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I assume that you like Token as the abstract class which 
</I>&gt;<i> defines some standard behaviour which is likely needed by 
</I>&gt;<i> classes derived from it. In that role it failed miserably, as 
</I>&gt;<i> either no behaviour was defined or the defined behaviour was 
</I>&gt;<i> useless anyway for the deriving classes. IMO, the role is 
</I>&gt;<i> filled by CommonToken anyway (is that correct, Ter?), and 
</I>&gt;<i> whatever code has been removed from the Token class could be 
</I>&gt;<i> replaced easily if the need actually arises.
</I>
The standard java runtime has no equivalent to the old Token class in C#.
CommonToken and ClassicToken implement IToken but are otherwise unrelated
(nor should they be). Token is useful for injecting common behaviour when in
custom variants of the runtime.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Well, it could be that I'm using Linux and Nant 0.86 Beta, 
</I>&gt;<i> but I get:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Most likely is. We didn't have time to do Mono build testing for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; obvious reasons...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Did you test it on your Windows machine? I'm sure that my 
</I>&gt;<i> first test to use that build script was on Windows and it has 
</I>&gt;<i> failed then, too.
</I>
Yes. It was used to build everything incl. the runtime distros for .NET v1.x
and 2.x.

&gt;<i> &gt; Prebuild has bugs in it's Nant build file generation and 
</I>&gt;<i> vs2005/vs2008 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; project file generation iirc. Related to resource files I think but 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can't remember the specifics at the moment, sorry.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will look into that. Maybe I'll fix the Nant build instead, 
</I>&gt;<i> although having a functional Prebuild setup would help for 
</I>&gt;<i> the VS project files.
</I>
Might be worth checking if Prebuild be moulded to generate Nant files that
can build docs, the distro archives etc in addition to building the
assemblies...

<PRE>I am using subclassing to separate application code from the
parser code in our C/C++ parser, CPP_parser.g which is
available from the antlr website.

I have called the demonstration application code MyCode.cpp
and you could see how this was done for C++.

Basically this is done by including a call to the subclassed
functions in the required places in the antlr grammar definition.

I think this a useful facility because it keeps the code,
statements and, in particular, the data, separate, enabling
different people to work on the two parts at the same time.

 &gt; My boss stopped by today with a question that I'm relaying
here as I'm
 &gt; really not familiar enough with the mechanics to know if
antlr
 &gt; supports this mode of operation.
 &gt;
 &gt; What he'd like is to be able to keep the specification
clean and the
 &gt; code separate. He mentioned Grammatica which uses the EBNF
to produce
 &gt; a parser, but you implement the actions by extending the
class for
 &gt; each leaf in the generated code.
 &gt;
 &gt; Have I made myself clear? Is this something that antlr
supports?
 &gt; Pointers to where I can easily resolve this are as (if not
more)
 &gt; welcome as direct answers.
 &gt;
 &gt; Thanks for any information.
 &gt;

Well, are you talking just about making a parser or are you
talking
about a translator?

Somebody wrote a &quot;literate programming&quot; system for ANTLR which
is all
about keeping the action code separated from the .g file.  A
web search
should turn it up, it may be on the antlr.org file sharing
page as well.

If you are talking about a translator, grammar subclassing is
another
approach.  <A HREF="http://www.codetransform.com/fun_with_antlr.html">http://www.codetransform.com/fun_with_antlr.html</A>
has a few
details about managing an eight pass translator.

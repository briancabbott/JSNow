<PRE>Fortunately the C# preprocessor is extremely basic, so the task shouldn't be
hard at all. To start with, it's important to understand that the
preprocessor *must* be implemented with the lexer, because the following is
valid:

 

#if false

@&quot;

#endif

 

If the @&quot; is processed by the lexer, it will consume the #endif as part of
the verbatim string and mess everything up. Here's what I would do:

 

.         Implement a basic lexer rule to consume the characters following
the #directive, up to but not including a single line comment marker //

.         Use a separate expression grammar to parse preprocessor
expressions.

.         Set a flag in the lexer if the next code is excluded code.

.         Override NextToken for the lexer, and if the flag is set to true,
call out to a rule other than mTokens (a basic implementation of lexer
modes).

 

When I release version 3.4 of the runtime, the Lexer class has a new method
ParseNextToken which can be overridden to help perform this task. I haven't
tested the following, but it's what I would start with if I wanted to make a
C# preprocessor.

Sam, thanks so much for taking the time to look at that. If I could, let me
try and explain what I'm trying to do and tell me if you think it's
possible. For my own edification, I'm trying to implement a C# grammar. I'd
like to implement the pre-processor at the moment. Implementations I've seen
generally using only a lexer and use some type of trick to maintain a stack
(e.g. for nested ifdefs and simple if/elif expressions). I figure why not
use a parser to maintain the stack -- isn't that the reason for existence
for parsers anyway? So that's what I'm trying to do -- use a lexer and
parser to implement the pre-processor. 

 

The big difficulty is changing the lexer rules depending on whether I'm in a
#if def block that is active or not. I figured with ANTLR I'd be able to
compute if the #ifdef block is active and then throw a switch to either
parse tokens and hand those tokens off to the C# parser or consume and
ignore all input up to the next pre-processor instruction thereby disabling
that chunk of code. If I can do this then I could put the pre-processor and
parser in the same file and construct the AST in one pass! Would that be
cool? And clean? And maybe worth making a goal for ANTLR to be able to do?
:<i>)
</I>
 

To be a bit more concrete: Here is the production for matching newline at
the end of pre-processor instructions. The idea would be to enable
PP_SKIPPED_CHARACTERS only if inside a disabling #ifdef block which would
consume all characters till the next pre-processing instruction.

 

pp_new_line

  : SINGLE_LINE_COMMENT? ((NEW_LINE! PP_SKIPPED_CHARACTERS) | EOF!)

  ;

 

Here is what I was hoping would work as PP_SKIPPED_CHARACTERS. Unfortunately
I don't seem to understand how to flip lexer rules on and off well enough to
make this work...

 

PP_SKIPPED_CHARACTERS

  : { IfDefedOut }? ( ~(F_NEW_LINE_CHARACTER | F_POUND_SIGN)
F_INPUT_CHARACTER* F_NEW_LINE )*

  ;

 

I hope that is enough to give you an idea of what I'm trying to do. This
approach just seems so elegant to me (by which I mean almost all declarative
-- no need to sprinkle procedural logic in among my productions to maintain
a stack or whatever) that I'd hope that it would be do able in ANTLR. What
do you think? Is it a worthy goal? Does it feel possible to you? If not, is
a goal worth trying to achieve?

 

Thanks,
Chris

Hi Chris,

 

Lookahead prediction occurs before predicates are evaluated. If fixed
lookahead uniquely determines the alternative with a  semantic predicate,
the predicate will not be evaluated as part of the decision process. I'm
guessing (but not 100% sure) if you use a gated semantic predicate, then it
will not be entering the rule:

 

PP_SKIPPED_CHARACTERS

  : {false}? =&gt; ( ~(F_NEW_LINE_CHARACTER | '#') F_INPUT_CHARACTER*
F_NEW_LINE )*

  ;

 

Also, a word of warning: this lexer rule can match a zero-length character
span, which could result in an infinite loop. You should always ensure that
every path through any lexer rule that's not marked &quot;fragment&quot; will consume
at least 1 character. There's also a bug with certain exceptions in the
lexer that can cause infinite loops - this has been resolved for release 3.4
but I haven't released it yet.

Subject: Have I found an Antlr CSharp3 lexer bug if...

 

Have I found an Antlr lexer CSharp3 bug if I can alter program execution
(exception instead of no exception) by introducing a lexer production with a
predicate that is always false? For example

 

PP_SKIPPED_CHARACTERS

  : { false }? ( ~(F_NEW_LINE_CHARACTER | '#') F_INPUT_CHARACTER* F_NEW_LINE
)*

  ;

 

I would think that such a production should always be ignored because it's
predicate is always false and therefore would never alter program execution.
Yet I'm seeing a change in the execution of my program. I'm seeing it enter
this function and throw a FailedPredicateException. I wouldn't have expected
that this function should ever even have been executed because the predicate
is always false.

 

     [GrammarRule(&quot;PP_SKIPPED_CHARACTERS&quot;)]

     private void mPP_SKIPPED_CHARACTERS()

     {

          EnterRule_PP_SKIPPED_CHARACTERS();

          EnterRule(&quot;PP_SKIPPED_CHARACTERS&quot;, 31);

          TraceIn(&quot;PP_SKIPPED_CHARACTERS&quot;, 31);

          try

          {

              int _type = PP_SKIPPED_CHARACTERS;

              int _channel = DefaultTokenChannel;

              // CSharp\\CSharpPreProcessor.g:197:3: ({...}? (~ (
F_NEW_LINE_CHARACTER | F_POUND_SIGN ) ( F_INPUT_CHARACTER )

              DebugEnterAlt(1);

              // CSharp\\CSharpPreProcessor.g:197:5: {...}? (~ (
F_NEW_LINE_CHARACTER | F_POUND_SIGN ) ( F_INPUT_CHARACTER )

              {

              DebugLocation(197, 5);

              if (!(( false )))

              {

                   throw new FailedPredicateException(input,
&quot;PP_SKIPPED_CHARACTERS&quot;, &quot; False() &quot;);

              }

 

Sam, I'm on an all CSharp stack v3.3.1.7705. I'm using your VS plugin (which
is wonderful) and build integration to generate the lexer/parser (also
wonderful) and then running on top of your CSharp port of the runtime. If
you think this is a bug and you'd like to have a look at the repro please
let me know. The project is open source up on CodePlex. 

 

Thanks,
Chris

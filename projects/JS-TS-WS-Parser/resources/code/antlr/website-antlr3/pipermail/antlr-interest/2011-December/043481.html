<PRE>Dear all,

We are using ANTLRWorks (1.4.3) for our Compiler Design course at our
university.  I came across the following problem:

A student sought help since he was, from one day to the other, no longer
able to debug his parser grammar using ANTLRWorks on his laptop.  All the
usual remedies (i.e, changing port number, disabling firewall) did not
help.  I should also add that the grammar was flawless, and I was able to
debug it with ANTLRWorks on my machine.

Being absolutely clueless, we decided that the student should try whether
he would be able to use the ANTLRWorks debugger on his desktop machine at
home.  And, it actually worked!

The difference in terms of OS versions between the laptop and the desktop
machine are as follows: laptop, Windows 7 (64 bit), desktop machine,
Windows 7 (32 bit).

Does anyone of you have an explanation for this behavior?  Or, are there
any other sources of problems we could look at?

Thanks,

Stephanie

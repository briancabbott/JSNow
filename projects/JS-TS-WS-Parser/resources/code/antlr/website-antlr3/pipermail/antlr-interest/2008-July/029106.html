I expressed myself extremely poorly.  I am a long-time, hard-core C
programmer but with a Unix background.  I merely dabbled with the Java
because it was easy to get started with ANTLR by using it.  I take
your point and will take more care how I express myself.  Still, the
Microsoft way of doing C is presenting me with a whole extra learning
curve.

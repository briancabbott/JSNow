Yes. The whole key (which you alluded to) is that the more
complicated rules are just written in Java, so you are not
really limited by any artificial &quot;translation language&quot;.
You write Java using a large library of token-stream
manipulation functions. I also have a few rules that manipulate
ASTs (mostly for expression processing).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I also found that examples like the &quot;main&quot; one above
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seemed to be about the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; most complicated examples shown for AST translation languages
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like TXL. When in fact, that &quot;main&quot; example is one of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simplest rules, and I have many hundreds of rules, most more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complicated than that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds like you and I should talk on the phone sometime when i get more 
</I>&gt;<i> time to think about a simple general rewrite system.  Where were you 
</I>&gt;<i> during the workshop!? ;)
</I>
Not invited :( Probably just as well, as I'd have probably
been more vocal than even you about things. That's not good,
as I'm not a well-respected guru in this field like you are :)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I found that I was just getting bogged down trying to keep ASTs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in my head. I felt it was much easier to write translation rules
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in simple text as shown with the &quot;--&gt;&quot; separator above. That way,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you never even have to think about ASTs much.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you do multiple passes or all translations in a single?  What kind 
</I>&gt;<i> of &quot;engine&quot; did the replacing?
</I>
Multiple passes...several hundred passes in fact :)
The problem I have now is not in being able to write very
complex rules, it's keeping all those rules in an order
that works. For example, I fire the &quot;make any functions
that are missing a return type return 'int'&quot; rule before
the &quot;change the 'int main()' C function to the equivalent
Java method&quot; rule.

Here's a very high-level design description:

And here's an English description of what many of my rules
are doing:

I'll be writing a complete writeup of the design in a couple
of weeks, I'll post a link when it's ready.

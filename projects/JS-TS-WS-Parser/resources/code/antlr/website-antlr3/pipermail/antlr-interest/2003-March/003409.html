<PRE>Hello Terence and Loring,

The template idea has been around for years. I think it the 
distinguishing feature of &quot;two level grammars,&quot; although my reference 
for two level grammars does not use template-like syntax.

I think that templates are more general than precedence parsing, 
especially if it is possible to add semantic actions and/or 
tree-building annotations to templates. Precedence rules only handle 
issues related to precedence and associativity. It seems that the syntax 
for handing precedence/associativity via templates is not too 
unreadable. Also, a template-based grammar can always be deconstructed 
down to a &quot;normal&quot; ANTLR grammar, which means that the core analysis and 
runtime code could not have to change at all if it was implemented as a 
preprocessor. So, my (naive) inclination is that templates are a better 
option than explicit precedence rules when performance issues are not 
taken into account.

Probably, dedicated precedence parsing is more efficient. However, with 
a template-based approach, you could have predefined left_infix, 
right_infix, prefix, postfix, etc. templates that would be specially 
optimized during the analysis in the same way. In other words, it seems 
like somebody could implement the templates first via a preprocessor for 
a proof of concept, and then later integrate the template processing 
into the LL analysis phase for optimization purposes.

- Brian

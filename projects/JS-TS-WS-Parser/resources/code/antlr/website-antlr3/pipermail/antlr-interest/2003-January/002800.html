<PRE>Note also that if an unexpected token is found you will probably get the
exception thrown &quot;k&quot; tokens ahead of where you would have thought the error
would occur because that unknown token would not be in the lookahead tests.

And yes, I recommend my approach in the gcc toolkit :)

Subject: RE: [antlr-interest] Re: catching an exception in the parser
and cont inuing - will this work?


I checked out the generated code as Monty suggested.  If I understand
what I am looking at it appears to me that the receipt of an unexpected
token causes the parser attempt to re-sync by skipping the entire
current rule.  Is that right?

If so, it now appears that my best strategy is that adopted in the gcc
project &amp; pass information about the current include file in the tokens.

Thanks.

</I>&gt;<i> behavior that I want to use by returning a &quot;special&quot; token unknown to

</I>&gt;<i> Any hints on this would help, although I am also re-reading the docs

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The main thing that would make life easier for me is if I can

</I>&gt;<i> tokens.  That is, it would be a pain in the neck if such processing 
</I>&gt;<i> had to be associated with each parser rule separately.  I'm not sure 
</I>&gt;<i> if I am being clear about that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The other two strategies that you suggest (hidden token stream;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Subject: [antlr-interest] catching an exception in the parser and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; continuing - will this work?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am handling &quot;include files&quot; in my lexer, as in the java example 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provided with antlr.  This means that fact the lexer is in an 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; included file is transparent to the parser.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, it turns out that I want the parser to be made aware of 
</I>&gt;<i> the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fact that the lexer is in an included file. (Kindly assume that I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have a sound design reason for this ;-) Given the amount of 
</I>&gt;<i> lookahead 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that may occur, I am sure that the only safe way to do this is by 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; putting the correct &quot;notification&quot; on the stream of tokens passed 
</I>&gt;<i> to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the parser.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is it possible to have the lexer pass a back a &quot;bad&quot; token (i.e. 
</I>&gt;<i> one 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that the parser can never recognize), catch a resultant exception, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and then (here's the important part) force the parser to take up 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; right where is was when it got the &quot;bad&quot; token?  It would amount to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; skipping over the &quot;bad&quot; token, except that the exception handling 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code would set a flag or two that would be available later to 
</I>&gt;<i> parser 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; semantic actions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have looked at the exception handling documentation, and sifted 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; through my generated parser.  It is not clear to me if my strategy 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BTW, I am still using antlr 2.7.1 - I want to try to finish what I 
</I>&gt;<i> am 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doing before trying the switch to 2.7.2.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks.

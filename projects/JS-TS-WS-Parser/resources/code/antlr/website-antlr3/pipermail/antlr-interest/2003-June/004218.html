I just want to confirm that heterogenous ASTs work very well in java 
mode (even if there are some tricks to know, like only modifying ## 
at the ending action of each rule :| ).

One of the coolest things I've done with them is override toString() 
adding specific information that could be browsed on an ASTFrame. 
Gorgeous.

Enrique.

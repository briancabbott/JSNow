</I>&gt;<i>  interesting.  What happens when you need to use structure not just  
</I>&gt;<i> token sequence?
</I>
I have a large library of methods that work on token streams. Methods like:
getContainingFunction, getNextScope, findNextToken(&quot;foo&quot;), etc. As for
&quot;knowing where you are in the tree&quot;, such as &quot;look for this pattern of 
function declaration
(but of course don't look for it *within* another function)&quot;, I just 
don't do that. i.e.
I might look for pattern &quot;f(...) {&quot; anywhere.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  how did you decide that you could replace those variables with  
</I>&gt;<i> strings?  Did you do flow analysis?  If so how did you do it on a  
</I>&gt;<i> linked list of tokens?
</I>
Actually, in this case, now that I think about it, I lied...I would generate
System.out.println(hello + world);
But In some places, I do look at all references to a variable, see that 
none of them are setting the value, and so make it
&quot;final static&quot; if it's at the class level, and sometimes get rid of the 
variable declaration altogether. Ad hoc, I know :(

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I guess what I'm doing is more akin to natural language  translation. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm sure an English to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Spanish translator has relatively little logic that does tree  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transformation (e.g. putting the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> adjectives *after* the nouns).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  an interesting analogy.  You are saying that language translation  is 
</I>&gt;<i> mostly word for word change and some grammatical changes such as  you 
</I>&gt;<i> would see from English to German where the verb's at the end.
</I>
I had spent just as much time investigating natural language processing 
systems as programming language processing systems
when I started. My impression is that all the work in NPL is in 
understanding context and handling exceptions, not word
replacement. &quot;white house&quot; becomes &quot;casa blanca&quot; (not &quot;casa blanco&quot;). 
But &quot;The White House&quot; in Spanish is still &quot;The White House&quot;!
I saw an poster for a NLP conference once and I noted that a newpaper 
headline in the back said &quot;Woods Eyes Masters&quot;.
Talk about context! Try parsing that sentence if it's not the headline 
of a sports page!

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm....  Do you have multiple phases also, just declarative rule  
</I>&gt;<i> replacement style?
</I>
Not sure what you mean. I have a couple hundred &quot;rules&quot;, each really a 
&quot;phase&quot;. Each rule is either
simple declarative or actual Java code.

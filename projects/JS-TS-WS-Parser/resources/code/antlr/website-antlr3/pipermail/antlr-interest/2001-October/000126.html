<PRE>Ric,

That's pretty much where I thought things were. I had read your other
message already, but had overlooked your reference to ICU. I actually found
out about ICU by looking at the jikes sources - I also need to get it to
support different encodings on Mac OS X.

Personally, I'd say if you're going to depend on an external library for
Unicode, ICU is the way to go. Unfortunately, I don't know the internals of
the antlr library well enough to take this on alone. At least not
considering my time constraints. Writing a lexer that handles Unicode is
probably less than a week's worth of work, since my task of parsing Java is
so narrow in scope (compared to generic Unicode support in antlr). Adding
generic support is probably an order of magnitude more work. If there had
been enough work done to give me a head start, I might have been able to
take it on. But that isn't the case. Oh well.

Thanks,
Dave

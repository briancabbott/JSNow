Yeah, I'm not so good with the the DFA diagrams and theory. Okay, so
 to revise my mental-model-of-thumb:

 &quot;The lexer keeps a set of &quot;still possible&quot; tokens, and inches through
the stream character by character. Each time, it iterates through the
remaining token definitions (in the order the appear in the grammar)
and removes the ones which do not match. It does some more checks so
it knows if it should error or not before starting anew, but if a
token is emitted it will have been that last-one-standing. &quot;

This would explain why order only matters when two token definitions
have both ambiguity and equal length.

Ergo, if you have:

A: 'test' '0'..'9' ;
B: 'test2';
Z: 'a'..'z';

The parser will take the string &quot;test2a&quot; and generate  [A,Z].

If tokens were defined in the order BAZ inside the grammar, the lexer
would generate [B,Z]. (Not yet tested.)

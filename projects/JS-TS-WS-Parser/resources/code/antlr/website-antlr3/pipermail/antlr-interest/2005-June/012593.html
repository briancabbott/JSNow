3) As well as antlr's default handling.

I tried to document where it varied from the spec, and tried to leave in 
comments where I still had to use the lookahead to verify that I was in the 
right spec.  It should be pretty clean, just not finished.

Actually, come to think about it, I might only have used the scriptonite 
grammar for some of the unicode characters so that I didn't have to start 
from scratch on that note.

I also seem to remember that I left out the regex portion, but I don't 
remember for sure.

I just hope it will be useful.  I would still like to use it, but it will be a 
while (another year or so) before I would get back to this, and it's already 
sat for over a year.

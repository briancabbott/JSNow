<PRE>Hi Salva,

thanks a lot for the link! I will have a look at your library and the docs. I'm sure there is some information in there, that's useful for me.

Kind regards
Daniel

Hi Daniel,

you can try out my library JRtfTree (port of NRtfTree in C#). It parses an RTF document and generates a DOM-like tree. It's not ANTLR but can be useful. 

You can find docs, examples and downloads in:

(Sourceforge) <A HREF="http://nrtftree.sourceforge.net/">http://nrtftree.sourceforge.net/</A>     (in english)
(My web) JRtfTree: <A HREF="http://www.sgoliver.net/jrtftree.html">http://www.sgoliver.net/jrtftree.html</A>   (in spanish)
              NRtfTree: <A HREF="http://www.sgoliver.net/nrtftree.html">http://www.sgoliver.net/nrtftree.html</A>   (in spanish)


Salva.

Hello,

I'm studying computer sciences and mathematics in Paderborn, and currently I'm working on a university project with the goal to transform RTF-documents into a text-based representation of braille, called HBS. 

The output format HBS is already specified, although there is no grammar (it is all in an existing application and I have to reengineer). Lots of information in a RTF-document is of course irrelevant for blind people and will therefore have to be eliminated. HBS codes a lot of structural information but far less layout information, so I will also be faced with problems such as: What do I do with footnotes, how should I represent text that is colored red (maybe even inconsistently), how can I map layout to structure appropriately, etc. just to mention a few. 

As I want to implement the RTF-HBS-Parser in Java, I naturally looked for parser generators for this language. To me ANTLR v3 seems to be the most promising approach in this area, and I really appreciate Prof. Parr for publishing his tool under the BSD License. 

I already baught his book &quot;The Definitive ANTLR Reference&quot; (and PDF) and have a question concerning the &quot;big picture&quot; for my project:

The RTF specification 1.9 from Microsoft is huge. What approach would you suggest in parsing RTF with ANTLR to the mentioned text-based representation of braille (HBS)? 

1) Use actions in the grammar rules?
2) Create an AST from the RTF input and a tree grammar for the AST that outputs HBS?
3) Use templates?
4) Other suggestions?

Thanks a lot in advance for some hints that help me starting off with my work, 

Daniel Warner

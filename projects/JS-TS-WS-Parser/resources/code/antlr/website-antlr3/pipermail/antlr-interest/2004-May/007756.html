<PRE>Here is my take on Unicode and Antlr.  I realize that parts of this 
have already be stated by other people in this list.  I thought it 
would be good to pull together all those ideas and present an approach 
as a cohesive, if way too long, proposal.

0) Philosophy
-------------
There are two clear separations that should guide this design: First, 
character set and character encoding are distinct concepts that must be 
cleanly handled throughout.  Second, the semantics of Antlr shouldn't 
depend on the implementation of Antlr.  This is especially true since 
Antlr is partially re-implemented for different target languages (Java, 
C++, C# etc...)

1) Structure
------------
I think a good case can be made for considering all parsing activity in 
Antlr to be in Unicode.  The a lexer parses streams of characters into 
tokens.  The grammar is described in terms of characters, not encoded 
bytes.  (C++ is still C++ even if encoded in EBCDIC).  Since Unicode 
encompasses virtually all known characters, defining the characters 
that Antlr lexers read as Unicode covers all bases.  (See notes below 
on binary.)

Handling different character encodings can be left completely to the 
input stream class.  If a grammar is to only be applied to US-ASCII or 
ISO-8860-3 characters, than the input stream can be limited to that, 
and map them into Unicode presented to the generated lexer - there is 
no need to make that distinction in the lexer grammar file.  On the 
other hand, by specifying the grammar over Unicode, then by simply 
changing the input stream, one can lex the same grammar over US-ASCII, 
ISO-8860-3, UTF-8, or Shift-JIS, etc.

2) Antlr Features
-----------------
The only semantic aspect of Antlr that actually depends on 
charVocabulary is the concept of compliment (element and set).  What 
started this thread was Terrance's observation that it is a constant 
source of pitfalls:  Currently inversion means &quot;of all the characters 
used in the grammar, not these&quot;.  Which means that if my grammar only 
mentions 'A'..'Z', and '0'..'9', then &quot;~('0'..'9')&quot; only means 
'A'..'Z'.  What most people expect is that &quot;~('0'..'9')&quot; should mean 
ANY character in the input stream except '0'..'9'.  Rather than fix 
this by changing the default charVocabulary, a better approach is to 
just to directly change the meaning of compliment to mean what people 
expect it to mean.  (See notes below on set inversion).

Once complement is defined this way, then the charVocabulary option can 
be removed.

A large range of Unicode based built in character classes has been 
suggested to be added.  I see nothing wrong with the proposed syntaxes, 
but I question the utility of all the proposed options.  I have yet to 
see a grammar that has a need to exclude particular Unicode blocks, for 
example.  On the other hand, some of the Unicode character properties 
are good candidates for inclusion.  I think restraint should reign 
here, and Antlr should only implement at first what people will 
actually use.

3) Implementation
-----------------
Since Unicode is no longer limited to 16 bits (and hasn't been for 
quite some time), internally, Antlr should avoid the whole morass of 
surrogate pairs, and simply do all character operations with integers.  
Furthermore, this is exactly what Java 1.5 is going to do, and it is 
really the only viable option in C++ (wchar being what it is).

In either Java, C# or C++, as implemented on most modern processors, 
there will be no performance difference manipulating 32 signed integers 
vs. 8 unsigned chars in a lexer where they are dealt with one at a 
time.  Even the string operations wouldn't be seriously affected since 
most literals in a lexer tend to be short words and will be about as 
efficient as small integer array compares.  This also allows all of 
Antlr's internal state values (EOF, etc.) to be disjoint from all 
characters (by using negative values)

The only major stumbling block to Antlr's use of Unicode internally are 
its bit sets and the need for compliment.  In the generated code, the 
use of bit sets is very regular, and a slightly more powerful 
representation could easily support Unicode with complemented sets 
without them always being O(2^20) bits in size.  Antlr's use of bit 
sets during the analysis and generation, however, might need some more 
sophisticated bit set class to handle things without simply resorting 
to huge bit maps.  I'd be happy to lend some coding effort to make this 
work.

When Antlr is used to parse binary formats, there is no real harm in 
the internal Unicode interpretation.  The input source would only 
happen to supply characters less than 256.  That set complements would 
include characters beyond 8 btis wouldn't matter: They'd never be 
presented by the input souce.  The only slight trick would be in proper 
handling of 0, which isn't a valid Unicode character.  But I don't 
think this would pose much of a problem.

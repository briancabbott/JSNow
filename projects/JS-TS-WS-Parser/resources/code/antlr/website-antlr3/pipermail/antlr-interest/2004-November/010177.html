<PRE>
From: &quot;Terence Parr&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">parrt at cs.usfca.edu</A>&gt;
&gt;<i> Ok, whew!  8 furiously written pages on visitors, tree node classes, 
</I>&gt;<i> tree grammars, and action execution:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/article/1100569809276/use.tree.grammars.tml">http://www.antlr.org/article/1100569809276/use.tree.grammars.tml</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully, this is clearly written.  Regardless, it summarizes my 
</I>&gt;<i> position rather thoroughly. ;)  Please send me feedback if you think 
</I>&gt;<i> the article can be improved etc...
</I>
Ok, I'll try to be advocate of hetero-trees. :)

The main point: if we have good description of heterohenous tree
we can generate all we need. In the article hetero-trees are considered 
without tool support. Of course, manual maintenance of node classes is
difficult. But with proper tool you don't need to write get/set
methods for chilren and attributes, don't need to write additional checks.

It is easy enough to write

node Program
{
    child Stmt+ stmtList;
}

to specify that Program is non-empty list of Statements. 
TreeDL tool from this description generates class Program
with get/set methods for child stmtList that is non-empty list of statements.
Note, that list length checking in set method is generated automatically.
Moreover, a bunch of other useful methods are generated.

The tree description for Java requires about 150 nodes.
Usual number of children and attributes: 2-3. So, it's easy enough
to mainain one file with such tree description, not 150 java classes!
even they are also in single file (nested in tree description class)
and have very simple structure.

&gt;<i> 1. tree structure is not validated 
</I>
Visitor should not validate tree structure, because it is described separately
and checked during tree construction. When tree structure is well-designed,
you can not create tree that doesn't correspond to syntactically correct input program.
Btw, parser is not right place to check tree correctness because tree can be 
constructed even without parser :) So, tree should be self-validating.

&gt;<i> Node actions may compute data needed by future actions. 
</I>&gt;<i> Because each action is isolated (usually as a overridden method in another class),
</I>&gt;<i> you cannot use the usual programming constructs like local variables, parameters,
</I>&gt;<i> and return values to pass information. You must use instance variables which are 
</I>&gt;<i> clumsy and violate data hiding principles.
</I>
If data is related to node (for example, cross-references between references and 
definition), it can be stored in [dynamic] attribute of that node.
I don't know how to use local variables to pass info to other method :)
but parameters and return values can be used for visitors. At least in interface methods
- of course, between visit-methods parameters should be passed using visitor fields.

class ActionVisitor
{
    // used by visit-methods
    Parameters parameters;
    // set by visit methods
    // can be used to simulate different return types
    ReturnValue returnValue;

    public ReturnValue process( Node node, Parameters parameters )
    {
        this.parameters = parameters;
        node.accept( this );
        return this.returnValue;
    }

    public void visit( SomeNode node )
    {
        // instead of return
        // unfortunately compiler can't check that all control paths
        // return value
        this.returnValue = 
            // node and parameters can be used
            F( node, parameters );
    }
}

Not very good-looking, but it works. Better if it is generated 
from some clear description like usual methods.

On the other hand hetero-trees allow easy access to child subtree.
As far as I know in tree grammar we have access only to entities 
mentioned in current rule? And another rule is required to return value of 

node.getSomeChild().getAnotherChild().getYetAnotherChild() ?

&gt;<i> Manual Tree Walkers
</I>&gt;<i> 2. manually built tree walkers have no guarantee that their parsing 
</I>&gt;<i> logic is complete and consistent 
</I>
The same is true for tree parsers - structure of tree built by parser 
can differ from tree used in tree grammar.

&gt;<i> 3. manually building tree walkers is much more laborious than the visitor pattern 
</I>
Visiting and tree walking are independent things.
The main purpose of visitor pattern is implementation of &quot;external virtual methods&quot;
for tree nodes. Visitors can use different tree walking strateges (or don't use walking at all):

1. Generated tree walker calls actions for each node. Actions called only from tree walker,
so only tree walker uses accept() methods of nodes to call correct walk() method of child node.
Class with action methods need not to implement visitor pattern.

In this case tree walking doesn't require additional work - walker is generated.
But it is useful only in simple cases when actions can be called before/after subtree walking.
If you need action/walking mixture, you need manual tree walker (at least some methods overriden).

2. Manual tree walking using child.accept( this ) in visit methods.

Yes, requires additional work and
&gt;<i> 1. action and tree structure walking code is entangled; you risk breaking action code
</I>&gt;<i> when altering the walking code 
</I>is true

3. There are special cases when manual tree walking doesn't require additional work.
For example, for codegeneration I use library that support such templates

class CodeGeneratorVisitor
{
    public void visitBinaryExpr( BinaryExpr node )
    {
        // template for output
        txt( &quot;${left} ${sign} ${right}&quot; );
    }
}

visit methods for parameters ${...} are called automatically in library method txt().
(I know, there is drawback - patterns can not be checked at compile-time, will try 
to improve code generation library in the future)

I think the last case is the hint of what should be a source for visitor generation
- I repeat, description should be clear from implementation details, 
only what we want to express.

&gt;<i> For example, how do you express that a child can be optional? 
</I>
node PlusNode : ExprNode
{
    child ExprNode left;
    child ExprNode? right;
}

In TreeDL types don't allow null value implicitly. You need to write '?' that means 'optional'
as in BNF notation. As far as I remember in some specification languages (VDM)
type [T] means 'value of type T or null'. May be if it would be used in programming languages,
NullPointerException would be rare. 
Damn, I need to improve my English :) Hope, you can understand me, but I'm 
sure there is grammatical error. 

&gt;<i> he says that his manually developed Java tree has about 150 nodes.
</I>&gt;<i> Regardless, you are still looking at lots of files.
</I>
No, I'm looking at single file with tree description. :)
It has about 1200 lines with some comments.
Parser is about three times longer.

Errata:
&gt;<i> enapsulating
</I>-&gt; encapsulating

&gt;<i> For example, why look in n files for n different statement node types? 
</I>&gt;<i> All StatementList can show is, at most, a typed list: List&lt;StatementNode&gt;. 
</I>&gt;<i> It says absolutely nothing about what the statements are--the subclasses
</I>&gt;<i> of StatementNode seem a rather weak and indirect method for specifying 
</I>&gt;<i> such a close relationship. 
</I>
&gt;<i> You cannot list the expression tree types; one must find all subclasses of ExprNode. 
</I>
HTML documentation can be generated from TreeDL tree description
with cross-references between node type and all inherited node types.
Example: 
<A HREF="http://treedl.sourceforge.net/treedl/treedl/com/unitesk/atp/treedl/TreeDL.tdl-xref/index.html">http://treedl.sourceforge.net/treedl/treedl/com/unitesk/atp/treedl/TreeDL.tdl-xref/index.html</A>

&gt;<i> Not only is the tree grammar more explicit (i.e., you are saying exactly 
</I>&gt;<i> what you mean rather than co-opting a type system),
</I>
As I mentioned in one of previous messages, it seems that tree grammar and tree description
are almost equivalent.

&gt;<i>it is smaller,  
</I>
Than what? Than generated from tree description Java files? Of course.
Tree description itself also is longer but mainly because it is written line-per-child
and uses longer keywords :) But I believe TreeDL is more readable (especially
for newbies) than ANTLR tree grammar (without actions, but with labels for subrules).

&gt;<i> it is completely self-contained 
</I>
The same is true for TreeDL tree description.

&gt;<i> and formally guarantees tree structure 
</I>
Again, it's true for TreeDL. But TreeDL checks trees during construction,
not during processing. 

Btw, repeating tree grammar when writing each action in some sence is like 
repeating a class declaration in each method that process objects of this class :)

&gt;<i> (as opposed to hand-written walk() methods that might forget to walk down 
</I>&gt;<i> one of the children). 
</I>
But not for generated walkers. And when actions are written manually,
missing of some child walking usually cause missing action.
In tree grammar also is possible to miss action.
So, chances are similar. :)

&gt;<i> I should also point out that Loring Craymer has a 
</I>&gt;<i> means of automatically generating tree grammars from the text parser grammar 
</I>&gt;<i> that builds trees (to be released in the 2.8 experimental release). 
</I>
Sounds interesting.

&gt;<i> Context Information
</I>
I'm also not very happy with visitors. But the way of passing context information
can be used not only with ANTLR tree grammars. Some notation can be used as source
for specification of actions over tree. It can be similar to tree grammar in part of
context information handling, but don't need to describe full tree structure
because it is described separately. And from it we can generate visitors or what else we need.

Some time ago, I played with preprocessor that generates visitors from something like this:

node SomeNode
{
    visit Visitor1
    {
        for( int i = 0; i &lt; $#childList; i++ )
        {
            F( $childList[i] )
        }
    }

    visit Visitor2
    {
        anotherNode.$childOfAnotherNode
    }
}

visit() methods are grouped by node, like methods. And children can be referenced using $childName
shorthand notation because I hate Java long getChildName() and like C# properties.

May be now it is time to remember this tool and rethink what should be a source
and what should be generated. I'm inspired by tree grammars :)

&gt;<i> Multiple Tree Grammars
</I>
According to my experience, cut/paste without tool support causes many-many errors.
&quot;Text editor in skilful hands - an awful weapon&quot; :)

In any case, tree grammars and descriptions - are two approaches to the same problem.
I believe that both are powerful enough, both have drawbacks and both can be significantly improved.
May be it will make compiler construction even easier than today :)

Alexey

<PRE>oops.

 

speaking of which this node (your upstream provider) is unbearably sluggish
too:

 

ded-p1-0.pltn13.sbcglobal.net [151.164.191.245]

 

anyone over there ever complain about slow internet connections?  Do these
problems go away at night?

Hmm, I wish that were the case.  I was hoping so.

 

However right now I am look at
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-3.0b6.tar.gz">http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-3.0b6.tar.gz</A> being downloaded and it is
stuck at 20% (see screenshot)

 

Simultaneous pings look good though.  The whole setup definitely needs to be
looked at; the connection looks functional but downloads are getting stuck.

 

Hey, look at this, these two nodes

 

Host antlr.org 69.108.221.142 - took a long time to respond

 

Host VIP-University-of-San-Francisco-IAF1073874.cust-

rtr.pacbell.net [69.108.221.142] - took a long time to respond

 

speaking of which this is kind of sluggish too:

 

 

Maybe there really is a prob on the local network!

 

Details:

So it *used* to hang and now that we moved it it's better?

 

If it's still bad, I'll have to move to our computer science network,  

which we know how to configure ;)

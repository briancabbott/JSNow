<PRE>Say you have your basic &quot;for&quot; or &quot;while&quot; loop, e.g.

for(i=0; i&lt;10; i++) {
&#160; print i
}


In the &quot;pie&quot; example, the author has a while loop that uses a &quot;defer&quot; parameter to indicate that the interpreter will do the job of evaluating the expr that determines if the loop proceeds.


&#160;&#160; |&#160;&#160; 'while' expr[true] slist[true]
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; {if (!defer) interp.whileloop($expr.start, $slist.start);}

I would like to be able to break out of a &quot;for&quot; or &quot;while&quot; loop, as is done in many programming languages, e.g.

//Read rows from a cursor and print out the contents of field 1 until it says &quot;break&quot;
while cursor.hasrows() {
&#160; cursor.getrow()
&#160; if cursor.getfield[1] = &quot;stop&quot; then break&#160; //&lt;-- When field one says &quot;break&quot; we should exit the &quot;while&quot; loop.
&#160; print cursor.getfield[1]
}

What I think I need to do is add a boolean to my interpreter that indicates that a break statement has been encountered, and then test for that condition = true in each rule action.

so in my &quot;statement&quot; rule, I would add an alternative:

|<i> 'break' { if(!defer &amp;&amp; !interp.breakfound) interp.break = true; }
</I>
and then add the &quot;&amp;&amp; !interp.breakfound)&quot; into every rule.&#160; That way, the parser would not execute any interpreter functions until the breakfound condition was re-set.

I would also need to save the break condition prior to entering break-able constructs (loops and functions are the only ones I can think of) so that I could restore it after the end of the construct.&#160; That way the break statement only exits the loop it executes in.

e.g. in class Interpreter:

public whileloop(Token expr_start, Token slist_start) {
&#160; boolean saved_breakfound = this.breakfound;
&#160;&#160;&#160; ...Handle the loop stuff here...
&#160; this.breakfound = saved_breakfound;
}

Does this make sense?&#160; Is there a better way that I'm missing?&#160; I imagine the same idea could be used to implement a &quot;return(value)&quot; statement in a function as well.&#160; The only difference would be that a return statement would exit the function no matter how deep it was into loops.&#160; For that, I'd need some kind of tri-state indicator, with values like 0 =&gt; continue, 1=&gt; break out of loop, 2 =&gt; return from function.

Any thoughts?

Thanks!
</PRE>

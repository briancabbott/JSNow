<PRE>Terence,

I have to say again that heterogenous trees approach also allows to separate
tree structure descriptions and operations. Moreover, visitors approach is not unique
- there are other techniques of &quot;external dispatching&quot;. Of course, they are more easy to use
if there is special notation and tool support, but tree grammars also are unusable without ANTLR :)
And heterogenous tree can expose homogenous interface, so heterogenous trees can be used in tree grammars :)

</I>&gt;<i> Hi.   This article pretty much summarizes my experience and  
</I>&gt;<i> intuition, which is not perfect but I think I've learned a trick or  
</I>&gt;<i> two over the past 20 years building these suckers:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/article/1100569809276/use.tree.grammars.tml">http://www.antlr.org/article/1100569809276/use.tree.grammars.tml</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am not building a compiler. Rather, I envision a number of C#  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; utilities, all of which might be based off of the same AST.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This will be a problem I'd say.  You'll need to build a new method in  
</I>&gt;<i> each tree node object for each new utility, possibly screwing up the  
</I>
...or you can define separate visitor or visitor-like operation...

&gt;<i> other utilities.  Very poor separation in my opinion.  I like  
</I>
...and it will be separated from tree description...

&gt;<i> encapsulating all functionality for a tree walk in place rather than  
</I>&gt;<i> over many many files and entangled with the walks for other utilities  
</I>
...operation description also will be in single file independent on
other operation definitions...

&gt;<i> or phases.  With a tree grammar, you'll never touch the tree  
</I>&gt;<i> descriptions  and can't possibly mess up the other utilities.
</I>
...the same is true for heterogenous trees -
definition of new operation doesn't require to change tree description...

&gt;<i> Hetero trees are fine for one phase translations.  I think co-opting  
</I>&gt;<i> the type system to enforce and describe structure is a nice trick but  
</I>&gt;<i> it doesn't scale well per my arguments in the article.  For example,  
</I>&gt;<i> the same tree structure can be walked by a tree parser in any target  
</I>&gt;<i> language (for which you have a target) whereas using a type system  
</I>&gt;<i> locks you into that language.  For example, C just doesn't have the  
</I>&gt;<i> type system to handle what an OO language can do.
</I>
I see no problems with modelling of required OO features in C
and translation of heterogenous tree description to C.
There are the example - TreeCC tree description can be translated to C:
<A HREF="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/treecc_doc/treecc_toc.html">http://www.southern-storm.com.au/treecc_doc/treecc_toc.html</A>

&gt;<i> In summary, Alexey is clearly a very smart guy and has a nice tool.   
</I>&gt;<i> SableCC also uses this approach, written by another smart guy. :)   
</I>&gt;<i> Using the type system is nice for many applications.  They are  
</I>&gt;<i> obvious to the casual observer and work great for many simple  
</I>&gt;<i> translation, 
</I>
I think, the extentions of Java and C# programming languages
with complicated translation to language itself are not simple examples :)

These tools are implemented using heterogenous trees described in TreeDL:

<A HREF="http://www.unitesk.com/products/chase/">http://www.unitesk.com/products/chase/</A>
And Portable.NET C# translator implemented using heterogenous tree described in TreeCC:
<A HREF="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/portable_net.html">http://www.southern-storm.com.au/portable_net.html</A>

&gt;<i> though you have to write the tree recognizer by hand  (&lt;shudder&gt;).  
</I>
Tree walker can be generated from tree description.
It is needed to write only actions for affected node types.

&gt;<i> For larger problems, I hope over the next n years to  
</I>&gt;<i> convince you that tree grammars are the way to recognize  
</I>&gt;<i> structure. :)  Give me a chance to finish v3 and then watch the  
</I>&gt;<i> torrent of doc/articles/papers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ter
</I>
But there are other ways :)

Regards,
Alexey

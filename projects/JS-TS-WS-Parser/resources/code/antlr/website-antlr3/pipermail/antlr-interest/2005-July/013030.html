Not sure didn't follow the first part of the thread, didn't see the
complete grammar. It may come from surrounding rules, maybe in
combination with the alternative that only matches a TAB. Would have
to check all the lookahead sets generated with -diagnostic. When you
have parts that match nothing or complete rules that match nothing you
get really unintuitive behaviour in the lookahead sets, that's why we
have ANTLR to tell us if we might have missed something. Although
antlr is sometimes a bit overzealous. (version 3 will make life quite
a bit better...)

Anycase left factoring is usually a good solution to getting rid of
those warnings. Also
in this case you get better performance thanks to the left factoring
since antlr can decide things by looking ahead one token in stead of
two (or more).

Cheers,

Ric

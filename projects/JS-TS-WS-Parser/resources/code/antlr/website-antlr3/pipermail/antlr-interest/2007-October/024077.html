I've put new versions of some project files up, which finally use
relative paths and have the NET_2_0 symbol defined in case of the the VS
2005 files. I don't have VS 2003, so I didn't enter the symbol NET_1_1
into the build context of that solution. This isn't probably the cause
of your problem, as the treated classes aren't referenced by runtime
itself, but only by generated parsers. Anyway, the solution file is
still at revision one and hasn't changed in my local workspace. The
project works otherwise fine on my notebook.

&gt;<i> Actually, the previous version does work perfectly. It seems that

</I>&gt;<i> the moment?
</I>
What is FSP? The source code itself should work as well the 3.0 version,
as far my tests tell me so far. ParserSharedState isn't mentioned in one
single file of the entire workspace and otherwise unknown to me. Can you
find out which file exactly doesn't work at the current revision for you?

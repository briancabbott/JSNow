Not with ANTLR, you don't. There's one call to the parser to get the
AST, and a whole different approach to getting the parse tree.
That's what that other long &quot;postmortem&quot; thread was about: the suggestion that maybe
ANTLR could just return the parse tree when no instructions for building
an AST are provided.

Judging from the discussion, it looks like that's not going to happen.
So to see an ANTLR parse tree, follow these instructions:

Scott--

As I have pointed out several times, &quot;tons of extra nodes&quot; is not what the 
analysis shows.  If you do not have sufficient need for processing 
non-ANTLR trees to experiment with a mechanism which can be effectively 
used now, why do you expect to have sufficient need later to justify the 
effort of maintaining a modified version of ANTLR 3?

Basically, you have gotten into the &quot;designer fools gold&quot; trap.  (I've been 
there.)  Solving the core problem--using ANTLR tree grammars on non-ANTLR 
trees--has become secondary to the &quot;one true solution&quot;.  Frankly, I would 
be quite happy to see an example of an ANTLR tree grammar being used to 
process non-ANTLR trees productively and I suspect that others would, 
too.  If you have a good reason for doing this, why not test to see if the 
idea really makes sense?

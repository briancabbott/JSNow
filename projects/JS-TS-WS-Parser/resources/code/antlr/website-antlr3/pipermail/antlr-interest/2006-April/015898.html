<PRE>As I know till now:
1)Parser create a AST and then a TreeParser can travel through it
2)from the result class of &quot;GnuCEmitter.g&quot; and &quot;StdCParser.g&quot; I can see 
each reduce function of TreeParser will contain a AST parameter and Parser 
none.

who can tell me more about the function desin about them? 


Thanks,

Xiao Yongqin

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hello!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm working with the C# target. I'm writing test cases for my parser. I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> try to parse a collection of input files to verify that they all parse as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> expected (later I'll probably also verify that erronous input fails to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> parse, but that's for another day). I'm trying to use NUnit to manage the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> test cases.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It is convenient for the parser to throw an exception at the first problem
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> since NUnit will catch unhandled exceptions and display their tracebacks,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> etc. The ANTLR book talks about how to do this. As I understand it I have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to provide my own mismatch() and recoverFromMismatchedSet() methods. I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> also have to provide a @rulecatch block that catches RecognitionException
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and rethrows it. The book shows this in Java, but the C# version is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> basically the same (I replaced IntStream with IIntStream).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It almost seems to work. However while playing with my test cases I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> noticed that under certain circumstances no exception is thrown and the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> parser returns normally... even though an error message is written to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> standard error. In the case in question I have an extra ';' where 'END' is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> supposed to be. I get the following message on standard error:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> extraneous input ';' expecting END
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The message is quite reasonable. The problem is that NUnit thinks the test
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> succeeded. NUnit's GUI console does display the error message on the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 'Console Error' tab but the test still shows green. This is a problem for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> me because when I run my tests I want to be able to just look at the green
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> lights and be happy. If I also have to investigate other tabs I will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> likely forget and I might overlook a problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So my question is simply: is there a way to get even this kind of error to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> thrown an exception as well? I could also solve my problem if there was
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> some way to learn from the result returned by the parser if the parse was
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> completely successful or not. Did ANTLR execute any kind of recovery? If I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> could check for that I could fail the test and be happy as well.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Peter
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This seems to be a bug in ANTLR as such behavior doesn't fit my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expectations, too.
</I>&gt;<i> No, it is not a bug, it is the defined behavior as you can see from 
</I>&gt;<i> the runtime. A missing token is manufactured and no exception is 
</I>&gt;<i> thrown, an extraneous token is deleted and no exception is thrown. 
</I>&gt;<i> This is part of error recovery.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Check the docs for the runtime functions like getMissingToken and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, while there is no exception, it does increment the error 
</I>&gt;<i> counts, so all you need do is after the invocation of the parser in 
</I>&gt;<i> your test, check for a non zero error count and throw an 're' or 
</I>&gt;<i> something similar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Seems like you forgot to override a method. If you want an exception 
upon first error you must make sure that the recovery mechanism does not 
start.
In ANTLR v3.1.x the mismatch() method was renamed to 
recoverFromMismatchedToken() - imo that should be clearer in the release 
notes, i.e. a BIG FAT warning because it is so different from the book.


Does that help?

Paul

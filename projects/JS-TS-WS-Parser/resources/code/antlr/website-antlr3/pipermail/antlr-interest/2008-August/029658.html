The fact that I think my original way was better from a work point of
view, will not stop me giving everyone enough of their own rope if I
can ;-) This is not extensively tested yet - first I need to verify that
I did not break the standard adaptor, then I need to make sure that
installation of a custom adaptor is easy. But I think I have escaped
being the last one to finish 3.1 - it looks like there will be a day or
so for me to improve things. In this release, you will find that AST
building is upwards of 10X faster than before too, depending on just
what you are building.

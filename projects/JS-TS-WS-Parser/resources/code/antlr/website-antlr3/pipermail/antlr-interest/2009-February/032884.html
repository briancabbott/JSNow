IIRC from a related discussion last week, this will indeed blow up 
unless (as Jim suggested) you make these into pointers and call 
new/delete at the appropriate points.  (Or you leave it as is and 
use placement new and explicit destruction; but those are just 
weird-looking.)

This is because the default initialisation of the scope structures 
just calls malloc, which won't invoke any constructors (and the 
free at cleanup time won't call destructors).


Jim: maybe it'd be useful to put the definition of ANTLR3_MALLOC, 
ANTLR3_CALLOC, and ANTLR3_FREE into an #ifdef __cplusplus block, 
so that if the parser is being compiled as C++ it'll invoke 
new/delete instead of malloc/free.  (Though some care might be 
needed if arrays of parser-definable structures are ever 
allocated.)  That ought to automatically make the use of C++ types 
within scopes &quot;safe&quot;, at least as far as construction/destruction 
goes.

Or possibly (to limit the blast radius) rather than changing those 
three macros directly the templates for the scope code could be 
changed to call different macros that call malloc/new as 
appropriate.  (Something similar should be done for the rule 
return structures, too.)

Of course, none of this is exception-safe, which does complicate 
the use of C++ types, since most will assume that they can throw 
exceptions with impunity.  It seems probable that any thrown 
exceptions would lead to a memory leak somewhere.

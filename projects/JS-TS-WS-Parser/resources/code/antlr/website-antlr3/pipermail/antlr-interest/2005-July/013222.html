<PRE>Really good Antlr people,

I am struggling with the design decision of whether to use a heterogeneous vs homogeneous AST. I would love some advice from people who've been there and done that.

First, let me make this clear ... I agree 100% with what Terrance says about not putting *actions* into strongly typed node objects (see <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/blog/antlr3/trees.tml">http://www.antlr.org/blog/antlr3/trees.tml</A> and search for &quot;Heterogeneous Nodes&quot;). If you do that, and if you need more than one pass, then you've got code for 5 different passes all sliced up and scattered around each of your node classes. Yuck. So I am not asking about that aspect of the decision.

But I am struggling with the concept of *naming the relationships* between nodes. After all, the AST is supposed to be the &quot;canonical representation&quot; of what the source code says, right? It is meant to be simplified, robust against grammar changes, and convenient to understand (right?). So, if I think about how I'd design a tree with all that in mind, I start to picture nodes with named relationships between them. But that starts taking me in the direction of heterogeneous trees. 

Here's an example. Say I parse a SQL SELECT statement (which I happen to be doing). I use Antlr's great tree operators, and a tree grammar to do one pass, and here's part of the tree that I wind up with:

     SELECT
       |
       |
     FIELD (&quot;sls_dt&quot;)
     |       |
     |       |
    ID(&quot;a&quot;)  ID(&quot;Sales_History&quot;)

As you can see, a FIELD node has an alias (that's what the first child is) and a table name (that's what the second child is). Now, here's the question. I can look at the tree, and using my own knowledge of SQL, I can see that the first child is the alias and the second child is the table name. But the tree doesn't *say* that.

But shouldn't a &quot;canonical representation&quot; of the meaning of the input code go ahead and spell such things out? In other words, can we say that the next tree is objectively better for most purposes?

     SELECT
       |
       |
     FIELD (&quot;sls_dt&quot;)
     |       |
     |       |
   ALIAS   TABLENAME
     |       |
     |       |
    ID(&quot;a&quot;)  ID(&quot;Sales_History&quot;)

And, if that is an improvement, then the next question is, why don't I introduce a specific node class, called FieldNode, which has a method called getAlias() and another method called getTableName()? Then, my node class takes care of naming the relationships for me. Then, I don't need the 2 imaginary nodes.

I've seen this approach discussed in detail in books by John Gough and Pat Terry, both of whom have taught me a lot through their writings. But I haven't been able to find a detailed discussion of the *other* (all homogeneous) approach.

How have you long-time antlr users come to approach this, and why? And any pointers to materials that discuss this topic would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

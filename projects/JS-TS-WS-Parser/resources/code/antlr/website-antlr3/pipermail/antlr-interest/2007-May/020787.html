Not quite; it simply reassigns the type of the token being 
generated by the current rule.  This is how you can have common 
grammar creating multiple tokens.  Instead of having a separate 
rule, it's simply declared in the tokens header section and 
assigned as needed through actions.  Have a look at some of the 
other example grammars; I'm sure several of them use this 
technique.

No, that's not the case.  These are all being done in *lexer* 
rules, and inside the lexer all the whitespace is always present 
and must always be accounted for if it's contained within a single 
token (since the lexer works character-by-character).  Whitespace 
outside the other tokens, on the other hand, gets consumed by the 
top-level WS token (or whatever you've called it), which is 
usually then assigned to the hidden channel.  This means that the 
*parser* rules don't have to worry about the whitespace, since 
they'll never see it.

I think I phrased that poorly, but I hope you get what I mean :)

<PRE>I agree with all of this.
It seems a very clear set of proposals.

Subject: Re: [antlr-interest] proposal for 2.7.4, Unicode, and more...


&gt;<i> Here is my take on Unicode and Antlr.  I realize that parts of this 
</I>&gt;<i> have already be stated by other people in this list.  I thought it 
</I>&gt;<i> would be good to pull together all those ideas and present an approach 
</I>&gt;<i> as a cohesive, if way too long, proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 0) Philosophy
</I>&gt;<i> -------------
</I>&gt;<i> There are two clear separations that should guide this design: First, 
</I>&gt;<i> character set and character encoding are distinct concepts that must be 
</I>&gt;<i> cleanly handled throughout.  Second, the semantics of Antlr shouldn't 
</I>&gt;<i> depend on the implementation of Antlr.  This is especially true since 
</I>&gt;<i> Antlr is partially re-implemented for different target languages (Java, 
</I>&gt;<i> C++, C# etc...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Structure
</I>&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;<i> I think a good case can be made for considering all parsing activity in 
</I>&gt;<i> Antlr to be in Unicode.  The a lexer parses streams of characters into 
</I>&gt;<i> tokens.  The grammar is described in terms of characters, not encoded 
</I>&gt;<i> bytes.  (C++ is still C++ even if encoded in EBCDIC).  Since Unicode 
</I>&gt;<i> encompasses virtually all known characters, defining the characters 
</I>&gt;<i> that Antlr lexers read as Unicode covers all bases.  (See notes below 
</I>&gt;<i> on binary.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Handling different character encodings can be left completely to the 
</I>&gt;<i> input stream class.  If a grammar is to only be applied to US-ASCII or 
</I>&gt;<i> ISO-8860-3 characters, than the input stream can be limited to that, 
</I>&gt;<i> and map them into Unicode presented to the generated lexer - there is 
</I>&gt;<i> no need to make that distinction in the lexer grammar file.  On the 
</I>&gt;<i> other hand, by specifying the grammar over Unicode, then by simply 
</I>&gt;<i> changing the input stream, one can lex the same grammar over US-ASCII, 
</I>&gt;<i> ISO-8860-3, UTF-8, or Shift-JIS, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Antlr Features
</I>&gt;<i> -----------------
</I>&gt;<i> The only semantic aspect of Antlr that actually depends on 
</I>&gt;<i> charVocabulary is the concept of compliment (element and set).  What 
</I>&gt;<i> started this thread was Terrance's observation that it is a constant 
</I>&gt;<i> source of pitfalls:  Currently inversion means &quot;of all the characters 
</I>&gt;<i> used in the grammar, not these&quot;.  Which means that if my grammar only 
</I>&gt;<i> mentions 'A'..'Z', and '0'..'9', then &quot;~('0'..'9')&quot; only means 
</I>&gt;<i> 'A'..'Z'.  What most people expect is that &quot;~('0'..'9')&quot; should mean 
</I>&gt;<i> ANY character in the input stream except '0'..'9'.  Rather than fix 
</I>&gt;<i> this by changing the default charVocabulary, a better approach is to 
</I>&gt;<i> just to directly change the meaning of compliment to mean what people 
</I>&gt;<i> expect it to mean.  (See notes below on set inversion).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Once complement is defined this way, then the charVocabulary option can 
</I>&gt;<i> be removed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A large range of Unicode based built in character classes has been 
</I>&gt;<i> suggested to be added.  I see nothing wrong with the proposed syntaxes, 
</I>&gt;<i> but I question the utility of all the proposed options.  I have yet to 
</I>&gt;<i> see a grammar that has a need to exclude particular Unicode blocks, for 
</I>&gt;<i> example.  On the other hand, some of the Unicode character properties 
</I>&gt;<i> are good candidates for inclusion.  I think restraint should reign 
</I>&gt;<i> here, and Antlr should only implement at first what people will 
</I>&gt;<i> actually use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Implementation
</I>&gt;<i> -----------------
</I>&gt;<i> Since Unicode is no longer limited to 16 bits (and hasn't been for 
</I>&gt;<i> quite some time), internally, Antlr should avoid the whole morass of 
</I>&gt;<i> surrogate pairs, and simply do all character operations with integers.  
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, this is exactly what Java 1.5 is going to do, and it is 
</I>&gt;<i> really the only viable option in C++ (wchar being what it is).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In either Java, C# or C++, as implemented on most modern processors, 
</I>&gt;<i> there will be no performance difference manipulating 32 signed integers 
</I>&gt;<i> vs. 8 unsigned chars in a lexer where they are dealt with one at a 
</I>&gt;<i> time.  Even the string operations wouldn't be seriously affected since 
</I>&gt;<i> most literals in a lexer tend to be short words and will be about as 
</I>&gt;<i> efficient as small integer array compares.  This also allows all of 
</I>&gt;<i> Antlr's internal state values (EOF, etc.) to be disjoint from all 
</I>&gt;<i> characters (by using negative values)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only major stumbling block to Antlr's use of Unicode internally are 
</I>&gt;<i> its bit sets and the need for compliment.  In the generated code, the 
</I>&gt;<i> use of bit sets is very regular, and a slightly more powerful 
</I>&gt;<i> representation could easily support Unicode with complemented sets 
</I>&gt;<i> without them always being O(2^20) bits in size.  Antlr's use of bit 
</I>&gt;<i> sets during the analysis and generation, however, might need some more 
</I>&gt;<i> sophisticated bit set class to handle things without simply resorting 
</I>&gt;<i> to huge bit maps.  I'd be happy to lend some coding effort to make this 
</I>&gt;<i> work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When Antlr is used to parse binary formats, there is no real harm in 
</I>&gt;<i> the internal Unicode interpretation.  The input source would only 
</I>&gt;<i> happen to supply characters less than 256.  That set complements would 
</I>&gt;<i> include characters beyond 8 btis wouldn't matter: They'd never be 
</I>&gt;<i> presented by the input souce.  The only slight trick would be in proper 
</I>&gt;<i> handling of 0, which isn't a valid Unicode character.  But I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> think this would pose much of a problem.

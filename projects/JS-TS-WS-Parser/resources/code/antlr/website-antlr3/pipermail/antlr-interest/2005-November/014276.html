<PRE>Hello!

ANTLRWorks 1.0ea5 is now available at this URL:

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/works/index.html">http://www.antlr.org/works/index.html</A>

This version fixes and improves several things. I would like to  
emphasis some new features:
- it is now possible to see syntax diagram for lexer rules
- as requested at the ANTLR2005 Workshop, syntax diagram and NFA can  
be exported to EPS file
- two new refactoring features: extract rule and inline rule
- debugger: it is now possible to break on exception generated by ANTLR
- it is also now possible to specify the path of the javac tool

The ANTLRWorks jar has everything you need including the latest  
version of ANTLR 3.x and StringTemplate 2.x.

Feel free to send comments to the antlr-interest list or online at:

Enjoy this new release!

*** History ***

Version 1.0ea5 - 11/13/05

- new: display syntax diagram and NFA for lexer rules
- new: export syntax diagram and NFA to eps file (File&gt;Export Rule&gt;As  
EPS...)
- new: inline and extract rule refactoring

- added optional path to javac in the preferences
- added output text pane in debugger (all System.out from the parser  
are redirected to this pane)
- added break on exception in debugger
- added regex expression in the Find dialog
- added &quot;Find Text at Caret&quot; and modified menu shortcut for &quot;Find  
Previous&quot;
- added invalid character literal detection

- improved caret jump to position by centering the text
- improved syntax coloring to match more of ANTLR 3 specification  
(label, tokens block, etc)
- improved display decision NFA: doesn't require an exact caret  
position anymore
- improved rule folding: can now fold using the bottom anchor
- re-introduced actions folding (anchors can be disabled in the  
preferences)
- expand or collapse all rules or actions
- improved Go To Rule: ignore case and display typed text in red if  
no match found
- improved debugger connection to remote parser (threaded)
- build and debug/debug: the starting rule pop-up menu has been moved  
to the input text dialog
- improved the build &amp; debug feature to include the ANTLRWorks jar  
itself in the classpath

- hide and disable ideas during debugging
- display a message if the syntax diagram cannot be displayed
- display warning message if ANTLR 2.x grammars detected
- changed debugger port from 2005 to 0xC001 (49153)

- fixed a bug where the undo/redo menu item title would not display  
the correct action name
- fixed a bug in the Find dialog where some pattern would cause an  
exception (didn't quote in the regex)
- fixed a bug which would prevent drag and drop of rules to work on  
Windows
- fixed a bug where not all messages would be displayed in the  
console (added group &quot;idle&quot;)
- fixed a bug where applying the preferences would apply the current  
look and feel (not needed)

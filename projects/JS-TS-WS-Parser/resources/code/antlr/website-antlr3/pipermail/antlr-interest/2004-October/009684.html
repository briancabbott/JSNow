Michael:

Yes, I will certainly agree that compiling on various platforms can be a
headache.  I've seen cross-platform C++ headers that would make your eyes
bleed.  But OTOH, user contributions from ANTLR users on various platforms
could assist in that effort.  And to be honest, there's no &quot;official&quot;
support for Antlr on Windows platforms to speak of.  It took quite a bit of
trial and error to get Antlr to even run under Windows. 

&gt;<i> Given developers with the same level of proficiency and 
</I>&gt;<i> experience with C++ and Java, most will be able to produce an 
</I>&gt;<i> application like ANTLR much more quickly and easily with Java 
</I>&gt;<i> than C++. 
</I>
Well, with all due respect I'm not sure how you can make that assertion.
IMO, it depends to a large degree on the individual programmer.  If any
particular language was significantly easier to use, everyone would be using
it.  In any case, this is a philosophical issue on which we may simply
disagree.

&gt;<i>           There are of course some applications where the 
</I>&gt;<i> need to optimize memory usage and/or speed aggressively 
</I>&gt;<i> suggest C++ (or perhaps C or assembly
</I>&gt;<i> language) might be a better choice.
</I>
Yes, like parsers &lt;g&gt;.  In a debug build, it takes my antlr-generated (C++)
parser about 15 seconds to parse a 77k source file.  With full optimizations
enabled, the same code finishes in slightly under 2 seconds.  I'm not
kidding.  I was sweating bullets when got my parser to work and found it was
so slow.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Whether the ANTLR development effort over the years would 
</I>&gt;<i> be been less 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; productive if C++ was used is questionable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not at all. Ensuring it compiled correctly on a variety of 
</I>&gt;<i> C++ compilers across many OS platforms would have been a job 
</I>&gt;<i> in itself.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; True that it would be impractical to post binaries for all
</I>&gt;<i> platforms, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; given the nature of ANTLR, I would assume that most people 
</I>&gt;<i> interested 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in such a tool would have access to a C++ compiler.  It's 
</I>&gt;<i> not uncommon
</I>&gt;<i> on most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; platforms to build your own tools from source code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR users all have access to gcc I suppose but, that is far 
</I>&gt;<i> from saying they are C++ developers and can fix any issues 
</I>&gt;<i> that arise while attempting a build. Many are Java or C# 
</I>&gt;<i> developers and may be quite unused to compiling C++ projects. 
</I>&gt;<i> Lex/Yacc certainly don't require this level of familiarity.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Incidentally, the DFA-as-bytecode generation issue isn't 
</I>&gt;<i> a runtime 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; limitation, it is a *language* limitation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, and that's the reason I raised the issue.  Whenever you have to
</I>&gt;<i> resort
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to a hack in order to work around a fundamental language limitation,
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (IMO) calls into question whether the right language is being used
</I>&gt;<i> for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; job.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps. In this case my understanding is that Ter can 
</I>&gt;<i> already generate Java code for the generated DFAs. He is now 
</I>&gt;<i> trying to optimize the DFA generation/representation for Java 
</I>&gt;<i> targets. IOW, this isn't an issue about the ANTLR tool 
</I>&gt;<i> itself. DFA generation for C++, C# and other targets aren't 
</I>&gt;<i> affected and would presumably use those language's features 
</I>&gt;<i> (including any required hacks to make them similarly efficient).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It seems curious that Java has a goto in its runtime but no way to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; express that in the language.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I seem to remember it has something to do with Java's secure 
</I>&gt;<i> mobile code aspirations.

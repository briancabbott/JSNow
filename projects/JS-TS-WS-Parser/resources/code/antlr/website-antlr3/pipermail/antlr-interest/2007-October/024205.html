<PRE>Had some problems trying to get my lexer that worked under the 3.0 C  
target runtime to work under the 3.0.1 runtime.

The problem is solved now, so I'm posting this here for others in  
case they run into similar issues.

Basically, the lexer was crashing after lines like this:

   start = (const char *)(stream-&gt;data + (token-&gt;start * 2));
   len   = (token-&gt;stop - token-&gt;start + 1) * 2;

Here I'm just trying to get a pointer to the start of the token text,  
and its length in bytes. (Note that this is with a UCS-2 stream; the  
multiply-by-two operations are because each UCS-2 character occupies  
2 bytes.)

Inspecting the values of the variables revealed that while under 3.0,  
token-&gt;start was a character index (the number of characters, not  
bytes, relative to the start of the stream), in 3.0.1 it is an  
absolute pointer.

Similarly, where token-&gt;stop was a character index in 3.0 (the number  
of characters, not bytes, relative to the start of the stream), in  
3.0.1 it is an absolute pointer as well. Strangely, it is not a  
pointer to the end of the token text, but to the byte immediately  
preceding it. In the case of UCS-2 that means that it's a pointer to  
the second half of a character and isn't valid. Although this is  
correct for ASCII streams, it seems like a bug for UCS-2 streams.

That is, whereas in 3.0 given a character &quot;a&quot; at address 0x0f00:

- let's say stream-&gt;data is 0x0f00
- token-&gt;start is 0
- token-&gt;stop is 1
- the token's address is 0x0f00 + 0
- and its length is 1 * 2 (2 bytes)

But in 3.0.1:

- let stream-&gt;data be 0x0f00
- token-&gt;start is now 0x0f00
- token-&gt;stop is 0x0f01
- the token's address is 0x0f00
- and its length is (stop + 1) - start

So I was able to get my recognizer running by changing:

   start = (const char *)(stream-&gt;data + (token-&gt;start * 2));
   len   = (token-&gt;stop - token-&gt;start + 1) * 2;

To:

   start = (const char *)token-&gt;start;
   len = (token-&gt;stop + 1 - token-&gt;start);

Jim, is there anywhere where this kind of API-level change is  
documented in the release notes? It would be nice if this kind of  
information were included with future releases (or if it is already  
included, it would be nice if the info were made more prominent).

Another thing is that although the behaviour of the API changed, the  
documentation in the header files did not. The start field in  
&quot;antlr3commontoken.h&quot; is still documented as being &quot;The character  
offset in the input stream where the text for this token starts.&quot;

I spent several hours last night trying to find the changeset which  
introduced these changes and I had little success. In the spirit of  
constructive criticism, there are a couple of things you could do to  
make the development history easier to search:

- in many changesets the commit message describes what sounds like a  
limited fix but the actual diff includes very extensive whitespace  
fixes; this makes it much harder to see the actual substantive change  
underneath all the cosmetic changes. Keeping your whitespace changes  
in separate commits would be a huge help.

- the same goes for spelling errors in comments; sometimes the number  
of corrections drowns out the changes to the non-comment lines in the  
source files. It would be great if you could keep such corrections in  
separate changesets.

- often it seems that unrelated topics are bundled together in single  
changesets, making it harder to understand the nature of the changes  
because they're all mixed in together.

- the commit messages tend to be fairly brief and it can be quite  
hard to figure out the purpose of a given changeset.

Hope I haven't caused any offense with this feedback; I think I've  
been spoilt lately by observing the Git development history. Check  
out their changelog for a shining example of ultra-clean development  
history:

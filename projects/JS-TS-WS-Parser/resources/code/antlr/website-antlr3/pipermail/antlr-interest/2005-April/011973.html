<PRE>Scott,
  You got me completly wrong. I am not talking about incremental
compilation, but incremental parsing in the editor which happens while
you are typing.

&gt;<i>Editor parsing only affects the file you're editing, not the
</I>&gt;<i>potentially impacted code outside that file. It usually triggers this
</I>&gt;<i>when the user pauses.
</I>
Thats cause if you give a time interval in which you wanna run ur
parser, say 500 ms, eclipse will collect all the consecutive additions
or removals and pass them as one block. It will be triggered at the
interval regardless of whether the user has paused or not.
Also note that additions and removals are collected separately.

Torkild,

&gt;<i>I'm currently implementing incremental parsing for my &quot;Visual
</I>&gt;<i>DataFlex plugin&quot; for Eclipse. Since the grammar is fairly large and
</I>&gt;<i>not very fast I see no other option because:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>* The outline view should be accurate.
</I>&gt;<i>* The &quot;highlight range indicator&quot; should be accurate.
</I>&gt;<i>* Automatic indentation should be accurate.
</I>&gt;<i>* Content assist should be accurate.
</I>&gt;<i>* Templates should be accurate.
</I>&gt;<i>* Specialized search should be accurate.
</I>&gt;<i>* etc. etc.
</I>
Thats what i wanna say. How are u gonna make all this stuff dead
accurate. See if you update all these components after say every 500
ms , then after every few keystrokes the user is gonna encounter a
short pause while all this stuff is updated, which will completly
screw the editing experience.

&gt;<i>Well it depends I guess. But in my experience the delta is not very large,
</I>&gt;<i>a few lines of code at the most
</I>
Thats where you guys are not getting me. Its NOT the size of the delta
that worries me. Its the amount of components which will be updating
themselves using that delta. If i have 10 components that wil redraw
themselves, then there WILL be a pause in typing no matter how small
the delta is.
And you can't tell these components to update themselves in the
background, you HAVE to pause the editor, cause if u don't pause then
the editor and everything else is out of sync.

<PRE>First of all, a happy new year to everyone!

I'm writing a grammar for one of those twisted languages, written by 
social deviants, that allow keywords to be used as variables.

The solution provided in the ANTLR Reference book on page 287 (&quot;Keywords 
as Variables&quot;) seems to work fine in most cases.

However I have found one case where my tests fail:

Please have a look at the attached grammar in keywords.g. Debug it with 
the start symbol &quot;procedureDecl&quot; and feed it the input &quot;PROCEDURE Proc; 
FORWARD;&quot;

The problem happens in &quot;subroutineBlock&quot; where the decision dfa chooses 
the wrong alternative 3 (asmBlock) instead of 2 (forward).

To me the generated decision DFA for the symbol &quot;subroutineBlock&quot; (also 
attached) looks erroneous. It correctly evaluates the disambiguating 
semantic predicates for alternatives 1 (external) and 2 (forward), but 
it skips the evaluation for alternative 3 (asmBlock) and makes its 
decision based on the SEMICOLON token, which is wrong because the 
semicolon can belong to the outer procedureDecl.

I have tested this with the latest stable version of the ANTLRWorks 
bundle (1.2.2).

thanks for any hints,
Markus

<PRE>The ANTLR Studio website (placidsystems.com) is down.
My host seems to have experienced a very bad crash from which all the data
could not be recovered properly.
My fault partly that I did not change the host last time.
The current website is their backup of it of 3 months ago.

I am trying to restore all the stuff. It should be done in a few hours.

My latest backup is only tilll 25/3/06. This applies for evaluation licenses
only.

All purchased licenses will be recovered though, since that information is
stored with my payment processor.
If you have changed your password since then, it will be reset to the one
that was mailed to you initially when you purchased your license.

The rest of the accounts containing only evaluation, well they are gone
forever :(

I am immediately transferring to a new host as soon as possible.

For the record and so that search engines can index this information
correctly -
Brainpulse.com web hosting &amp; their support sucks! Dont buy it even unless
you are crazy!!

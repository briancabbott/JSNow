<PRE>Hi,

I'm new to antlr too. I have the same questions as you have. Although 
I don't know exactly what it means, I know somehow _ttype does the 
work.

I have tried to find some hints from antlr manual, but I got nothing. 
Wait a minutes, maybe in the section about Lexer Implementation, you 
can get something. I'll read this section again and try to figure it 
out.

Hope it's helpul.

best regards,

fan

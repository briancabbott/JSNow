<PRE>Hi Ric,

You can down load the MSVC compiler for free now, as part of the .Net stuff
I downloaded it but have not tried to use it yet (still using V6 for what
ever C I get forced into mainly JNI to libraries and don't use C++ at all)

&gt;<i> Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BETTER MSVC INTEGRATION SUPPORT.  *ducks the rocks*  I know we all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hate M$, and I'm no exception.  But for the love of god, there's a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; LOT of development going on in MSVC these days, and ignoring the poor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; saps (like me) who have to use it is not so nice.  Basically, we need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for ANTLR to be truly platform agnostic, not just *nix agnostic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I only have limited access to MSVC6. So I can't really test stuff for
</I>MSVC.
&gt;<i> Basically I'm very close to the point to drop all MSVC support except for
</I>&gt;<i> structural things in the codegen (the extra #define's in class headers
</I>&gt;<i> stuff like that)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I started there was pretty much no MSVC out of the box support I then
</I>&gt;<i> naively said that I would like to support it. By now I'm more tending to
</I>&gt;<i> the opinion that I should not try to support a compiler that is 'weird'
</I>and
&gt;<i> I cannot test myself. Trying to cobble together community patches and
</I>&gt;<i> fail/success reports is not very effective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it would save myself and the community a lot of aggravation if
</I>&gt;<i> after an ANTLR release there's someone who cobbles up a MSVC-Version-X
</I>&gt;<i> rescue kit and puts it in the filesharing section.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To be clear about it I did not make the final decision to completely drop
</I>&gt;<i> MSVC yet. But if the 2.7.3 release will be another disaster MSVC wise I
</I>&gt;<i> might. So MSVC users grab those snapshots and prereleases and test them
</I>&gt;<i> till you drop and give (good &amp; specific) feedback!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To whit:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * NMAKE-compatible makefiles for the C++ libs.  If we can cobble up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; NMAKE makefiles, then we're cool with Ric--we're purely command-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; line.  I got no problem with that, since if you can make an NMAKE
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; file, you can make a GUI project for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If someone makes these for the latest snapshot/prerelease I'll drop them
</I>in
&gt;<i> the contrib section. Please be clear about for which MSVC version they are
</I>&gt;<i> though. Also DSP/DSW files are welcome. I don't expect any changes in the
</I>&gt;<i> amount of header/source files unless I get time to port the
</I>&gt;<i> TokenStreamRewrite stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To sum it up:
</I>&gt;<i> - Or things work out mostly via 2.7.3 release and MSVC getting saner with
</I>&gt;<i>   versions 7.0+7.1. And I'll meddle on with whatever comes my way in
</I>patches.
&gt;<i> - Or MSVC support gets dropped
</I>&gt;<i> - Or it will be third party via antlr.org filesharing
</I>&gt;<i> - Or someone steps up to do *continued* MSVC support (who has the
</I>compilers
&gt;<i>   etc)
</I>&gt;<i> - Or someone donates a license of MSVC for ANTLR support licensed to Ter
</I>&gt;<i>   maybe? (If I'd personally buy it, I'd buy the full version usable for
</I>&gt;<i>   commercial stuff, but to dish out that amount of cash for something I'd
</I>&gt;<i>   mainly use for ANTLR I'd have to fall on my head pretty hard)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not against MSVC per se, but I don't want the hassle it gives at the
</I>&gt;<i> moment (not to mention the rude behaviour of some people in the MSVC
</I>camp).
&gt;<i> I'd rather won't release something for a platform than release something
</I>&gt;<i> halfworking for a platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Has anyone mentioned smoke testing of builds yet?  If that's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already happening, let's get MSVC as a test target for the C++ libs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No compiler no test. Hmm no compiler no bugs.. no compiler no cry. Erm...
</I>&gt;<i> No test suite no test too.. but less usable for puns...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But seriously it would be very good to have a test suite. But heck I
</I>didn't
&gt;<i> even have time to write one for the compiler/tool I work on. Also not
</I>&gt;<i> familiar with the term smoke testing (I assume that's just checking if it
</I>&gt;<i> builds? then again then we'd need a farm of machines/os/compilers to check
</I>&gt;<i> everything probably not feasible for an opensource project at least not
</I>&gt;<i> this one)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * A warning-free build for the C++ libs, for all major targets.  A
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Windows build is still littered with warnings all over the place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Expecting a warning free build across all platforms is maybe not
</I>realistic.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>

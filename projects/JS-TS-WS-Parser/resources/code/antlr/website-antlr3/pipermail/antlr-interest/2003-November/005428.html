Hmmm. Is this true? Definitly not when using greedy blocks... Have a 
look at this simple grammar

top : TOKEN0 (sub | top )* TOKEN3 ;

sub : TOKEN1
         ( options {greedy=false;} : . )*
         TOKEN2
     ;

k=1 is needed and works ok. Try using k=10 and: Ooops!

&gt;<i> Also, as to actions in lookahead code:  this is something that Ter supported in PCCTS under the name &quot;guarded predicates&quot; or some

1.) You might really increase the set of parseable languages using this 
technique
2.) Sometimes using tree transformation is too expensive

</I>
Who knows ;) In any case it brings a bit life into discussion :)

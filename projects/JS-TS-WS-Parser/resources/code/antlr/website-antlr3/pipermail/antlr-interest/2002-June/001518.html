Well, theory is theory, and practice is practice. Most engineering problems
are exponentially bounded. Fortunately good solutions can be found in most
practical problems, otherwise they would be out of business ;-)

I was involved last year in a project dealing with formal verification of
digital circuits, and the big problem there is the exploration of all
possible future states starting from a given initial state. Note that I am
speaking of FSMs with states encoded on 100 bits or even more. The key in
the practical implementation was the use of Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams
(OBDD) to represent the state space. It is amazing how efficient this was
for practical cases. And all is due to the fact that all subtrees in BDD are
unique (reused).

I think that something similar can be used for lookaheads. Maybe not BDD but
Hex Decision Diagrams. Represent the lookahead as a tree where nodes have
(at most) 16 children. Each level of the tree &quot;consumes&quot; 4 bits from the
binary representation of the character/token. This won't be more efficient
than current implementation for *one* lookahead set, but when you consider
all lookaheads, a lot of subtree reusing can take place; I can bet many
lookaheads are similar (have common subtrees).

Best regards,
Bogdan

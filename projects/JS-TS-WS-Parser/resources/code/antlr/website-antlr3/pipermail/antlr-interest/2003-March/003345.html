<PRE>Does anyone know of a good reference or source code implementation about
dynamically typed languages.
I'm working on such a language in C#, so I can't really do nice tricks with
direct memory access. I looked at PHP implementation, but that seems to be
too complex for my needs. I need something simpler. I thought maybe
smalltalk implementation would be good, but my language is a bit different.
Currently I have variables stored in hashtable and each variable is an
object derived from common abstract Variable.
All the operations are dispatched thru dynamic dispatch on the variable, but
it seems to me that this is not quite efficient. There must be a better way.
I'd be happy if someone could point me to some research paper or
implementation of this.
Thanks,
Andrew

<PRE>Yes, it was mostly to make things easier. Originally I didn't have some of
those operators (equals, lt, gt), but with time I just added them.
That was one reason I found antlr StringTemplate hard to use. It's strict
separation of content and UI made it hard at times. I'm used to using CF
language, which is content/gui/logic all in one file. Not a good idea, but
gets things done really easily and fast.
I just added few constructs that I thought would be necessary. In some
instanced, you just need to put little bit of logic in your UI.
For example if you're displaying list of orders and want to flag those that
have total less than $100 in red. You could add a property to your business
object, but that's not always desirable, especially if you didn't author the
business object. But of course it could be argued the other way, that if
this requires some attention and if you deiced to change $100 to $200, it
would make more sense to have it in the object itself.
I've just know by experience (created 150,000 line cf back end system) that
sometimes you do need things like that in your UI for simplicity.

Hi Andrew,

Seems interesting.  I take it the enforcing separation philosophy was 
not a prime consideration for your derivative because of the equals 
operation you allow etc...?

ASTs are supported, the thing that doesn't work is tree rewriting  
(i.e. having a tree parser output another tree by using rewrite rules  
in the tree grammar). There are a couple of examples in the examples- 
v3.tar.gz as well as in the Wiki on how to use tree output.

I haven't used any of the Java grammars, but looking at Ter's it  
shows that that grammar simply isn't building trees. You could add  
the tree operators and/or rewrite rules yourself, and then write tree  
grammars to work with your tree. As tree building often depends on  
the thing you want to accomplish, that's probably the best way of  
doing it anyway.

As mentioned above, this isn't scheduled for 3.0 final, AFAIK. Ter  
wanted to finalize the stuff there is right now before adding new  
features.
I'd think that tree rewriting would come in 3.1 if there is a good  
way of unambiguously defining the process. I vividly remember going  
through the template output stuff with Ter a while ago, and that was  
hard enough to give right semantics to...

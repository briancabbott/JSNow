<PRE>Is it possible to declare separate header sections for lexer and
parser (even when lexer and parser are within the same *.g file)? I
seem to remember this being possible (in the past?).
 
I have had a look at the Antlr documentation under Header Section. It
refers to &quot;respective addendums&quot;. Where are these?
 
A problem I see with the (standard?) header file is that as it appears
in both the CPPLexer and CPPparser we can't declare any variables in
it, only externs.
 
What I would like to do is to declare a variable set in the lexer
which I can use in the parser. To do this I think I need to declare it
as a global in the lexer and use it as an extern in the parser (or
vice versa). to do that I need separate headers for lexer and parser.
 
Can anyone point me in the right direction please?

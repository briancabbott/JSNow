At least when using ANTLRworks a file called grammarname.tokens is created
with each line containing a token-text to ID mapping. This file is AFAIK
only for your convenience, nothing relies on it.

Of course, the tokens attached to Parser/Lexer classes as constants
(public-static-final) can be accessed without instantiating the lexer
or parser.

  Also, I still have interest in developing the ActionScript port for
&gt;<i>   ANTLR, but I'm a student (read: I'm under 18). Would I still be able
</I>&gt;<i>   to develop, because my signature is not legal.
</I>&gt;<i>

As a non-lawyer, I don't think that's a major problem--you don't need to be
of legal age to begin making a runtime port or other software project... you
just have to be of a legal age or have help before you make any contractual
agreement stuff. (You know, like licensing your work or something.)

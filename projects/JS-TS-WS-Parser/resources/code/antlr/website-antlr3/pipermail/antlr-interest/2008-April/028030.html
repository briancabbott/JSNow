<PRE>I just wanted to get one more follow-up on the list in case anyone is
searching on this in the future, then the issue can drop.

After going through John's grammar, I found that my problems were actually
being caused by using ANTLR 3.0.1 and not by anything I was doing. John's
grammar will compile under 3.0.1 with a couple minor tweaks (chaning one
rule that was using mixing rewrite operators and rewrite rules and remove
spaces on rule parameters), but it exhibits the same behavior mine had. That
is, parts of the AST are lost during backtracking without an error being
thrown and without any warning.

So, in summary, (and maybe everyone but me knew this...) if you are building
an AST and parts of the tree simply disappear, it might be because of
3.0.1.Try one of the incremental builds and it may solve your problem.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> That is, I can't seem to modify the grammar so that it doesn't require

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Is incomplete. I can get either the f.getName() function call in the tree
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or the length() function call, but not both.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So far I have tried using rule scopes, global scopes, parameters, return

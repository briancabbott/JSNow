<PRE>Let me try again with more explanation...

[01] eval:
[02]  ... ... ... | while_stmt | ... ... ...
[03] ;
[04]
[05] while_stmt
[06] :
[07] 	#( WHILE e:expr s:stmt )
[08] 	{
[09] 		while (eval(#e) == true)
[10] 		{
[11] 			eval(#s);
[12] 		}
[13] 	}
[14] ;

Line [07] matches the assumed tree for a while node.  When this matches, the
action (lines [08-13]) is executed.  The while-statement at [09] is executed in
the native language, which means that the &quot;eval(#s)&quot; at [11] will be executed
each time that the condition in the while at [09] evaluates to &quot;true&quot;

Note that [07] could probably be rewritten as follows, because it's likely
wasteful to traverse those trees to recognize them:

	[07] 	#( WHILE e:. s:. )

So, yes, stmt is another tree. ANTLR allows you to walk (and capture) the expr
and stmt trees once; after that, you must walk (and evaluate) each tree
multiple times.

Hope this is a bit more clear in what I was saying,

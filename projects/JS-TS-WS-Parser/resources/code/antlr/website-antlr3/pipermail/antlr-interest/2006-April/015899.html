<PRE>Hi All

I want to build a new language integration tool for VS2005. I want to 
integrate Latex into VS (I'm lazy, I'm spoiled and I need my code 
complete thingies ;-). However to do that I need a parser and a lexer. 
The documents assume you use Flex and Bison, however I was thinking 
about Antlr. So now my questions are:

1) Has anybody ever build a language package for VS with antlr
2) Has anybody ever created a LaTex grammar?
3) Has anybody ever tried to create those two things.

Also if anybody has any hints or tips I would love to hear those

Regards

Patrick

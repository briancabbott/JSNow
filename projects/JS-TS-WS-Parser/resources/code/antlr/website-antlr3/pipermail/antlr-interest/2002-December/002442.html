<PRE>thank you for the quick answer- but i think i can't really follow you. is
the ANTLR_SUPPORT_XML a new feature- i am using currently version 2.7.1, and
it doesn't seem to have any of the features you mentioned (in C++ libraries
at least) the alpha version 2.7.2 on the other hand, doesn't seem to have
the C++ header files. i guess they are not yet updated or something.

i also looked for the methods you mentioned in ASTFactory- well, again in
the C++ version those methods simply don't exist. is there a newer version
than 2.7.2.a5 (which i also took a look at, but as mentioned this one
doesn't seem to have the C++ libraries, i.e. the header files and so on)

thank you in advance for your patience

murat

There's some rough-ish stuff to write out trees in XML in the classes.
Compile with ANTLR_SUPPORT_XML defined then in your derived classes
override the toStream methods to customize your output.

operator&lt;&lt; works by calling the derived classes toStream methods (pretty
common way to do these kindoff things).

operator&gt;&gt; is a bit of a different problem. Think it's not possible to
implement reading in the sense of a operator&gt;&gt; since things have to got
through the ASTFactory to work in the most general heterogenous AST case.
Look at ASTFactory::LoadAST and friends. In practice the XML stuff mostly
works but it still needs work/docu for the general case.

Cheers,

Ric

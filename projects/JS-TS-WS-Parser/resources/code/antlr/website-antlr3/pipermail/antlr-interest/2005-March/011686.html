History, my friend. People have been attempting to do this for years and the
compilers always win (or at least they do after the compiler writers have
had a year or two to optimize).

Usually for the first year or so of a compiler's life, misguided programmers
keep writing their own assembly code &quot;because real programmers write in
assembler&quot;. They might be a wee bit more efficient, but then them compiler
catches up and they're left with some nasty, unmaintainable code that's at
best the same as what the compiler optimizes to (and usually not as good).
Then it's time to rewrite it maintainably ;)

It all boils down to the fact that intuition (&amp; common sense) is a
misdirected optimizer. Go for good, understandable &amp; maintainable design and
let a profiler figure out what you need to tweak into submission.

Of course, and that's a good reason ;)

<PRE>Hello

Terrence said: (snip) &lt;&lt;That said, ANTLR 2 is a mess built under duress
in my part time.  &gt;&gt;

This is disturbing news for all of us that has based projects on 2.x
versions ! It is NOT a matter of just swithcing to 3.0 in the midst of a
project !

I do sincerely hope that wa a figure of speach, and not a signal that
ANTLR bugs like the one I reported with the Wong Bitset Code generation
will not be attended to in 2.x

Sincerely worried

Geir Ove

Correct and correct. :)  BaseAST was meant simply to abstract out the  
child-sibling tree part so anybody could subclass to add fields like  
string and token type etc...  If you don't want a child-sibling, then  
implement AST.

That said, ANTLR 2 is a mess built under duress in my part time.   
ANTLR3 is much better designed.  The v3 overview slides I'm building  
for the workshop look good :)

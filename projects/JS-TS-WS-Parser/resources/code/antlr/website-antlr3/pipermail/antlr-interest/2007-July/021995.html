<PRE>I suppose someone should point out the obvious. Open source means 
precisely that: open source code of the program being developed.

I don't know where anyone gets the idea that it means you don't ever 
have to spend money if you want to use it.

It simply means that developers all over the world can work on the 
application in question as opposed to closed source, where the developer 
gets to decide who looks at the source and who doesn't, who gets to help 
write more code and who doesn't.

The beauty of open source is that you can get many people, from all over 
the world, working on something cooperatively, without having to have a 
Microsoft sized bank roll to make it happen.

As far end users are concerned, open source should not be equated to 
anything at the user level. It is strictly a means of developing software.

I'm not going to turn this into a static vs dynamic typing issue, I'm
not :X!

I agree that it would probably not be all that useful for larger
projects. I just don't think that traditional XML parsers should be
allowed to live anymore :)

&gt;<i> &gt; A library like this allows you to basically define the DTD in code as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well as giving you a set of &quot;strongly typed&quot; classes that you can use to

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, you can do that at compile time with tools like XML Beans in Java.
</I>&gt;<i> Why would you want to do something like that at runtime?
</I>
I will do some research on this. Thanks! Although thedailywtf.com tells
me Beans in Java go well with Access databases linked through Word
documents (or something like that).

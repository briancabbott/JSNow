I think that the reflection requirement is unnecessary and undesireable.  An attribute is usually one of:  1.) a String, 2.) a StringTemplate, or 3.) Boolean, and you could probably avoid Booleans as well with a bit of judicious design (single-valued &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; strings, for example).  On rare occasion, it may make sense to support an esoteric data type, but that can be handled via wrapper:  the wrapper, after all, only needs to know how to do &quot;toString()&quot;, and it is trivial to implement subclass wrappers for each esoteric type.  For that matter, you could support a generic Java wrapper that used reflection, but subclass a base wrapper class in languages that do not support reflection.

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [antlr-interest] ST 4.0 planning
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Dear ST-o-philes and related humans,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am starting the planning stages for ST 4.0. I begin my sabbatical  
</I>&gt;<i> next May, a few months after I finish this current book. I plan on  
</I>&gt;<i> writing software like crazy (for 15 months!). This will include  
</I>&gt;<i> optimizing ANTLR and hopefully converting ANTLR and ST to be ANTLR v3  
</I>&gt;<i> clean; no more ANTLR v2 requirement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As part of converting ST to v3 grammars, I took a look at updating  
</I>&gt;<i> things.  As I looked through all the complicated code that manages  
</I>&gt;<i> dynamic scopes, parameters, and nested templates I realized that there  
</I>&gt;<i> is a lot of stuff going on in there.  ST groove organically from a  
</I>&gt;<i> simple string with holes in it to a sophisticated tree-based  
</I>&gt;<i> interpreter. Tree-based Interpreters are much more difficult to build  
</I>&gt;<i> then, say, a byte code interpreter. Further, debugging ST stuff is  
</I>&gt;<i> quite difficult because all you have are objects and you have to chase  
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of pointers through hash tables and so on to figure out what is  
</I>&gt;<i> going on.  There is no code to step through related to your templates.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am contemplating moving to a JSP-like model where I generate Java  
</I>&gt;<i> (or C# or Python, ...) instead of doing an interpreter. There are a  
</I>&gt;<i> number of advantages:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. In principle, we could use the rechargeable architecture pattern of  
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR to generate whatever source code we want; C++ and so on. the  
</I>&gt;<i> only requirement would be some sort of reflection still because I  
</I>&gt;<i> don't want attributes to be typed in ST. That means that you'd need  
</I>&gt;<i> RTTI for C++, which it supposedly has now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  I would suspect that the templates would go much faster when  
</I>&gt;<i> executing &quot;natively&quot; in Java.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. You could debug templates by stepping through them just like you do  
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR parsers. Templates would translate to Java methods. Groups would  
</I>&gt;<i> translate to objects.  Like JSP, we could automatically compile things  
</I>&gt;<i> in the background. This means that they would go slow the first time  
</I>&gt;<i> you ran the template. Also, I would have to investigate a custom class  
</I>&gt;<i> loader so that I could unload templates.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm planning on breaking with absolute backward compatibility to fix a  
</I>&gt;<i> number of design flaws that came about because requirements changed  
</I>&gt;<i> during the last eight years.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, it is a bit premature, but I like to have things to think about  
</I>&gt;<i> while I'm waiting in line etc...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The idea of generating Java code is growing on me. Note that it would  
</I>&gt;<i> only be generating Java or stay an interpreter. I would not do both.  
</I>&gt;<i> Those are two totally separate products almost in terms of  
</I>&gt;<i> implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>

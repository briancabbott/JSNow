<PRE>&gt;<i> According to Cox, Thompson's original algorithm generated
</I>&gt;<i> machine code in the 1960s.
</I>
It was a fair portion of the beauty of his paper that he could
present mostly complete code in such a short space. However,
the machine architecture of the machine he was working
on fit this algorithm very well (and Thompson was clever
in coding it). I would not be as blithe as Cox in assuming that
modern machines are fast enough to forgo that advantage
(YAMV - Your App May Vary). Lexical analysis so easily
can consume a nontrivial portion of parsing CPU cost.
E.g., in  <A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/yebzy5o">http://tinyurl.com/yebzy5o</A> is claimed:

  &quot;From Intel XML Parsing Accelerator, we found that character
checking loop occupies more than 60% CPU cycles of the whole parsing
process, depending on the property of benchmark.&quot;

Of course, Thompson's algorithm (and Cox's analysis)
is oriented towards building lots of NFA's on the fly
for short-term use. Lexical analyzer generators have
the luxury of enormous CPU time to spit out optimized
(if not optimal -- though what one might be optimizing
for can vary) DFAs.

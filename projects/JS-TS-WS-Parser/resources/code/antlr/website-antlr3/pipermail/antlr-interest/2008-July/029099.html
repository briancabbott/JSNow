</I>&gt;<i> domain-specific grammar from these pieces.  So, question is, are there 
</I>&gt;<i> any repositories of these small sets of operations?  (I think of them as 
</I>&gt;<i> sub-grammars, though this term is used differently in Parr's article.) 
</I>&gt;<i> The grammars listed on the ANTLR web site all seem to be much 
</I>&gt;<i> higher-level.  I suspect I could find most of what I needed by cutting 
</I>&gt;<i> and pasting out of one or more of those, but a finer-grained packaging 
</I>&gt;<i> of these sets would be easier (read Parr's article, which IMO describes 
</I>&gt;<i> the benefits pretty clearly).

The capability you describe is introduced in ANTLR 3.1 which is only in 
beta now. So not many people are actually using this feature yet and 
obviously the people posting grammars didn't. This means that you are 
the first to create/use grammars for the described purpose.

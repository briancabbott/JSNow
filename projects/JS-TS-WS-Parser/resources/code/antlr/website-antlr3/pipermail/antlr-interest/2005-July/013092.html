</I>&gt;<i> Sent: Monday, 18 July 2005 7:10 AM
</I>&gt;<i> To: 'ANTLR Interest'
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [antlr-interest] Tricky vector constructor syntax
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying to write a parser for a scripting language used in an online
</I>&gt;<i> game.
</I>&gt;<i> The language is predictably very C-like with a few twists, most of which
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> quite benign, but one is really twisting my melon.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The language supports vectors and quaternions as data types and they have
</I>&gt;<i> provided syntax for constructing instances of these types that make it
</I>&gt;<i> just a
</I>&gt;<i> little bit tricky to parse. For example:-
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> vector v = &lt;4.0 , 1.2, 0&gt;;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course that's just an initializer, the same angle bracket syntax can be
</I>&gt;<i> used in expressions and each of the three elements of the vector can of
</I>&gt;<i> course be expressions also. A quaternion is for the sake of parsing just
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> same except it has four components.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The grammar (which I've attached) has an expression section shamelessly
</I>&gt;<i> lifted from the java.g sample grammar but altered slightly to match the
</I>&gt;<i> original yacc grammar supplied by the makers of the game. For the moment
</I>&gt;<i> I've
</I>&gt;<i> placed a rule for just the vector at the same level as the other constants
</I>&gt;<i> (the last alt of the postfixExpression rule) and even with a syntactic
</I>&gt;<i> predicate it still causes the same ambiguity warning. Does this look right
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> should I try and shoehorn it in at the same level as the &lt; operator?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I commented out some other stuff so at least without the production in
</I>&gt;<i> question the grammar compiles without warnings to give a fighting chance!
</I>&gt;<i> And
</I>&gt;<i> the lexer isn't complete yet so it won't produce the right tokens. Oh and
</I>&gt;<i> please don't ridicule my choice of token names too much :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Okay this is a strange one, so I haven't fully worked it out. However, it
definitely is between your relationalExpression and postfixExpression rules.


relationalExpression
	: shiftExpression ( (LEFT_ANGLE^ | LESSTHAN_EQUALS^ |
GREATER_EQUALS^ | RIGHT_ANGLE^) shiftExpression )*
	;

postfixExpression
	: lvalue ( INCREMENT | DECREMENT )?
	| list_initializer
	| IDENT LEFT_PAREN expressionlist RIGHT_PAREN
	| constant
	| LEFT_ANGLE expression COMMA expression COMMA expression
RIGHT_ANGLE
	;

The reason you are getting the warning, is because in postfixExpression,
&quot;expression&quot; is followed by RIGHT_ANGLE, meaning that in some cases the
recursion will confuse the parser. If you change &quot;expression&quot; to something
like INTEGER_CONSTANT the warning will disappear. The problem is only with
RIGHT_ANGLE, not LEFT_ANGLE.

What this means is that the following bits of code are ambiguous:

x = &lt; 1, 1, 1 &gt; 5 &gt;;

Not sure how to solve this one, as I have trouble getting syntactic
predicates in the optional alternatives right. Maybe someone else can
suggest an appropriate change?

One of your LEFT_SQUARE tokens is also spelt wrong (I think line 139). This
will lead to no error message in ANTLR but some confusion down the track.

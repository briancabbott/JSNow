Well, you might have a grammar with lots of start rules...should one 
really get a warning for that?  Certainly it would be nice to be able to 
get a list of these suckers.  Not sure a warning is proper since every 
single grammar will get a warning then ;)

Ah...you've beaten me to the punch :)  Thanks for all your hard work on 
PCCTS!

</I>
It sees class_head in the predicate but not in the list of rule 
references apparently.  Therefore a standard FOLLOW will not compute it 
properly.  I think I remember saying that a predicate is not part of the 
grammar and is merely there to show a minimum lookahead language that 
predicts an alternative.  It should not be included in FOLLOW 
computations.  HOWEVER, it needs to compute FIRST sets properly.  If the 
lookahead can see past class_head it must include what follows that 
specific reference since it knws the context of the FOLLOW.

&gt;<i> to me.  My hypothesis is that it is skipping the block
</I>&gt;<i> following the syntax predicate in computing first and follow
</I>&gt;<i> sets.  This is correct for first sets, but incorrect for
</I>&gt;<i> follow sets.
</I>
ANTLR computes standard static k lookahead to determine if the backtrack 
is necessary even if you specify one.  I should be computing this on the 
alternative not the predicate.

Tom: is this similar to the error you pointed out in PCCTS that you 
fixed regarding syn preds?

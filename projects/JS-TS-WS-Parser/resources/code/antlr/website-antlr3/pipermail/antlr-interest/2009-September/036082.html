</I>&gt;<i> That would be a bug. C89 is 20 years old; there's really no excuse for

Yeah - you are correct of  course, but even now I find implementations 
that will segv if you try this, so realistically, as the gate is going 
to cost you nothing at all, then belt and braces always seems like a 
good idea :-) But regardless, one should always set the pointer to NULL 
/after/ ;-) freeing it.

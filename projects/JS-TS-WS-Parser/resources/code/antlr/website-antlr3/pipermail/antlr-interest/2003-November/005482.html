<PRE>I think what Brian says is very reasonable given his type of 
application. His view concentrates on the semantics expressed by the 
design of his AST which is also implied in text disguised by synatx. Now 
, this syntax can change, semantics and thus AST remain the same.

However, your application could also be translaton from one language to 
another with a different syntax, but identical or only slightly 
different semantics. If this translation is complex it is very 
convenient to do this in more than one step using ANTLR tree 
transformation. In this scenario ANTLR-ASTs are the best you get. You 
have full control over what nodes are copied, deleted or moved. 
Remember, you can also do successive ANTLR-AST to ANTLR-AST 
transformations by which you can refine what you want in a convenient 
way. Finally, you can dump the whole ANTLR-AST to your destination 
syntax. I have done this very successfully with XML data that fits 
perfectly in ANTLR-ASTs.

</I>&gt;<i> I agree with Mike. I never use ANTLR's AST features because they aren't really
</I>&gt;<i> for *abstract* syntax trees--they are really a kind of *concrete* syntax tree
</I>&gt;<i> (similarly, parse trees ala JJTree are *concrete* syntax trees). This is easy to
</I>&gt;<i> see because the resultant tree is built using elements of the concrete syntax
</I>&gt;<i> grammar. An *abstract* syntax tree is independent of the concrete syntax of the
</I>&gt;<i> language. In fact, usually I create a syntax-independent domain model of the
</I>&gt;<i> language (e.g. with classes representing all the major concepts of the
</I>&gt;<i> language), and then create an ANTLR grammar that can parse a syntax that allows
</I>&gt;<i> one to express these abstract concepts textually. If you develop a language this
</I>&gt;<i> way then the ANTLR &quot;AST&quot; mechanism is basically useless. But, IMO, this is the
</I>&gt;<i> most sensible way to develop a language tool, because once you have the domain
</I>&gt;<i> model built you can have one team work on the concrete syntax (text -&gt; AST) part
</I>&gt;<i> of the project while concurrently another team is working on the semantics (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> AST evaluation, translation). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Terence made the point that ANTLR's &quot;AST's&quot; are better than JJTree-style parse
</I>&gt;<i> trees because the resultant trees are less sensitive to changes in the grammar
</I>&gt;<i> used for parsing. But, changes in the concrete syntax of the language, and/or
</I>&gt;<i> changes in the grammar used to parse it, still can easily reshape the resultant
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;AST&quot; unless one is very careful. But, the AST-first approach completely
</I>&gt;<i> isolates all grammar/syntax changes from other parts of the project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, I guess what I would like to see is a mechanism for specifying a
</I>&gt;<i> syntax-independent (&quot;abstract&quot;) domain model of a language, a mechanism for
</I>&gt;<i> specifying how to parse concrete textual representations of the language
</I>&gt;<i> (grammars), and a mechanism for translating between textual representations and
</I>&gt;<i> the abstract domain models (either one-way text -&gt; AST, or bidirectional text
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;--&gt; AST).

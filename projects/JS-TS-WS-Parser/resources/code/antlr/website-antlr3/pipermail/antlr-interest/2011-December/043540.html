&gt;<i> What's a &quot;typed syntax tree&quot; is. From looking at your code, it's a

</I>
Right, I mean where you have a Java class that represents each kind of
node in the tree (i.e. each kind of syntactic construct). So your
compiler is composed of visitors that work with a strongly-typed
representation of the syntax tree.

&gt;<i> Just skimmed your Ceylon.g. I totally forgot about that strategy
</I>&gt;<i> (using ANTLR rules with parameters and return values).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've done that. I didn't like it. Instead of stitching an object graph

</I>&gt;<i> calls and an internal stack instead of &quot;new&quot; and assignment. Wasn't
</I>&gt;<i> much better.
</I>
A Builder might work out a little cleaner, I'm not sure. Truth is it
didn't ever occur to me.  To be honest I think it would probably wind
up about the same.

(I was just basically following the same model that ANTLR uses for its
non-typesafe AST building.)

I'm not trying to hold up my grammar as some kind of model of clean
code. The best I can say is that it works and that it works really
well for non-wellformed input, mainly as a result of me having
painstakingly coded in a whole lot of special cases to improve on
ANTLRs default error recovery, which is often not really good enough
for what you need in an IDE.

&gt;<i> I very much dislike hybrid languages. Stuff like inlining Java in
</I>&gt;<i> one's grammar, C#'s LINQ, template languages. I have a hard enough
</I>&gt;<i> time understanding one language at a time.
</I>
Trust me I hate them way more than you ;-) The point I was trying to
make is that I wish that ANTLR could write that tree-building code for
me, instead of me having to handcode a lot of tedious stuff in Java
code embedded in a text file where I don't have any kind of error
reporting or autocompletion or any of the other stuff I'm totally
dependent on for the last ten years...

&gt;<i> Any way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Next time, for my ARON project, I'll subclass DebugEventListener and
</I>&gt;<i> move all that bookkeeping there. Builders are still complicated, true.
</I>&gt;<i> That's just the nature of Builders.
</I>
Hah! It would not have occurred to me to use an interface called
DebugEventListener to implement my tree building logic! Is that
something people do? So it gives you more like a SAX-style callback
API to build your tree? That sounds like it could work out much nicer.

&gt;<i> But at least the Builder and grammar are distinct.
</I>
Right, that would be ideal.

I was more thinking along the lines of I wish ANTLR would be able to
build the tree for me, but out of typesafe node classes, and without
the throwing-away-bits-of-the-tree behaviour that caused me so many
problems. But perhaps a SAX-style API would just be a simpler, more
robust solution.


&gt;<i> I DON'T build a &quot;typed syntax tree&quot; in my fado project for a couple
</I>&gt;<i> reasons. My pathetic efforts to build a generic SQL object model were
</I>&gt;<i> easily defeated. What I really needed to do was find and replace the
</I>&gt;<i> interesting bits. By leaving the parse tree in place, I was able to
</I>&gt;<i> reemit the input stream with just the interesting bits changes,
</I>&gt;<i> preserving formatting, comments, etc.
</I>
Yes, in my original mail I was sort of trying to distinguish between
something like JPAQL-&gt;SQL translation where you're essentially doing a
minimal sort of transformation and a &quot;real&quot; compiler where you're
doing a whole bunch of complex typechecking and then finally some
quite sophisticated transformation at the end, where the output
artifacts don't have a strict 1-1 correspondence to the input
artifacts. This is the kind of thing you want to do completely in Java
land with a typesafe syntax tree.

&gt;<i> The Ceylon and fado use cases are very different. But I think moving
</I>&gt;<i> inlined Java code out of our grammars is a positive step forward.
</I>
Definitely.

&gt;<i> Which is why I posted my original question. Debug event listener hooks
</I>&gt;<i> are only generated with a command switch. Terence didn't anticipate
</I>&gt;<i> they'd be used like this.
</I>
Ah right. Figures ;-)

&gt;<i> Thinking about it, I should probably mention:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR's DebugEventListener is kinda like a SAX EventListener.
</I>
Haha, I had not read to the end when I wrote the comments further up.

So I think you might be right, and that it might be *much* better for
ANTLR to provide a SAX-style callback API, where we can write Java
code using all the benefits of a Java IDE, than the embedded actions
that we have to use today. That definitely gels with all the
experience that I have had with ANTLR. It would definitely be an
easier API to get right than the thing I was suggesting.

If I would have had an API like this available to me when I was
working on the Ceylon grammar, I think it's definitely what I would
have used.

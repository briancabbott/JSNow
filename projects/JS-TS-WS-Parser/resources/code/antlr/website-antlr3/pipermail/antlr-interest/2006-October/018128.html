</I>
Just to be clear, I'm not saying I'm an &quot;average&quot; programmer or looking 
for tools for the &quot;average&quot; programmer.
I might be in the top 2% of all programmers, but I'm not in the top 0.1% 
of language-tools-gurus as Terence is.
So I want tools that helps us good-programmers-but-not-compiler-gurus 
build stuff.
I'm not a Terence looking to automate my parser-creation task;
I'm just an Andy looking to build a language translator while barely 
knowing the difference between LL(*) and LL(k).

Just as a compiler lets the programmer focus 100% on the problem at hand 
(application logic) and 0% on
the underlying level (creation of object or byte code), ANTLR lets me 
focus on the problem at hand
(lexing and parsing) and not the underlying level (creation of 
lexing/parsing code). Unfortunately, I
don't think there's one really good tool for hiding the whole &quot;language 
translation&quot; level. ANTLR treewalking
combined with StringTemplate attempts to do that, but falls short in two 
ways, I think. First, ANTRL treewalking
requires perfect knowledge of the input language structure. And second, 
I don't think treewalking is the better
way to slice the problem, as the problem scales up. In other words, when 
you have a ton on translation logic,
&quot;Here are each of the translation rules I'd like to apply&quot; is a better 
way to approach it than
&quot;Here is what to do at each node of the input structure tree&quot;.

<PRE>Austin,

Very well said -- all three points, on multiple levels.

I especially like your observation about languages. The design of the
language should not get in the way of getting common stuff done (Prolog, F#,
ERLANG, etc.), without giving even more back for the effort (as do C++,
Java, C#, etc.).

&gt;<i> pretend you have a SQL database as the ONLY thing available 
</I>&gt;<i> to the template engine
</I>
I don't know ST well enough to comment on its implementation, but it this is
an intriguing idea. Wouldn't you need expression support, in addition, to
allow the manipulation/combination of that data?

&gt;<i> -----Original Message-----
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Part of putting code into an open source project is letting
</I>&gt;<i> everybody
</I>&gt;<i> else read it. Another part is letting other people contribute to it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Before you spend a year writing code, go to some conferences that have
</I>&gt;<i> nothing to do with parsing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. There seem to be two models for using ST currently. First is &quot;let
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> templates run free.&quot; Second is &quot;call a template, then call another.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2a. The &quot;templates run free&quot; is I guess the &quot;best way&quot; but getting all
</I>&gt;<i> the data structures set up so that the templates can be happy takes a
</I>&gt;<i> hell of a lot of work. If you could do that, then one template could
</I>&gt;<i> blissfully call another and another, referring to the giant global data
</I>&gt;<i> store.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2b. The &quot;call one, call another&quot; makes more sense from an immediate
</I>&gt;<i> code
</I>&gt;<i> perspective, especially from a parser: here's all the context I have at
</I>&gt;<i> the moment, go generate a little bit of text and come back. I'll pass
</I>&gt;<i> that string up the chain, and somebody with more or different
</I>&gt;<i> information can insert that string into their context.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It makes sense for there to be a sort of happy medium, 2c, which maybe
</I>&gt;<i> should be built on top of some kind of hierarchical base data object
</I>&gt;<i> class. That way callers with fairly limited context could link a
</I>&gt;<i> template, or a location (anchor? namespace? context) inside a template,
</I>&gt;<i> to a concrete data element. But at the same time, the templates could
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> written to interact with each other, instead of just dumbly returning
</I>&gt;<i> text. In that respect, it seems a little bit like the DOM tree model.
</I>&gt;<i> Except that it shouldn't be. It should be more general purpose -- an
</I>&gt;<i> in-memory database, say. (Seriously: as a thought experiment, pretend
</I>&gt;<i> you have a SQL database as the ONLY thing available to the template
</I>&gt;<i> engine. What do templates look like?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively, think about what happens if template data access uses
</I>&gt;<i> xpath syntax.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My point is that the stuff *outside* the angle brackets is easy. It's
</I>&gt;<i> the interpolation and invocation and whatnot that costs all the effort.
</I>&gt;<i> At some level, you'll wind up writing a PHP interpreter. What do you
</I>&gt;<i> really want as your requirements?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. I read a bunch of stuff about how ST was a functional language. And
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> remember thinking, what possible use is this to me? Do I give a rat's
</I>&gt;<i> ass if my text is generated in a functional language? At the time, I
</I>&gt;<i> was
</I>&gt;<i> trying to implement automatically generated sequence numbers for things
</I>&gt;<i> like test cases and symbols. It was far more difficult than it needed
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> be to inject that single simple feature. I had to support it in my
</I>&gt;<i> code,
</I>&gt;<i> rather than having it come for free in the templates. And it tended to
</I>&gt;<i> taint my design. There needs to be a way to get stuff done, and if that
</I>&gt;<i> means that a bunch of nerds from the Esoteric Language Institute are
</I>&gt;<i> disappointed, give 'em a Klingon dictionary and send them home.

 &gt; My boss stopped by today with a question that I'm relaying here as I'm
 &gt; really not familiar enough with the mechanics to know if antlr
 &gt; supports this mode of operation.
 &gt;
 &gt; What he'd like is to be able to keep the specification clean and the
 &gt; code separate. He mentioned Grammatica which uses the EBNF to produce
 &gt; a parser, but you implement the actions by extending the class for
 &gt; each leaf in the generated code.
 &gt;
 &gt; Have I made myself clear? Is this something that antlr supports?
 &gt; Pointers to where I can easily resolve this are as (if not more)
 &gt; welcome as direct answers.
 &gt;
 &gt; Thanks for any information.
 &gt;

Well, are you talking just about making a parser or are you talking 
about a translator?

Somebody wrote a &quot;literate programming&quot; system for ANTLR which is all 
about keeping the action code separated from the .g file.  A web search 
should turn it up, it may be on the antlr.org file sharing page as well.

If you are talking about a translator, grammar subclassing is another 
approach.  <A HREF="http://www.codetransform.com/fun_with_antlr.html">http://www.codetransform.com/fun_with_antlr.html</A> has a few 
details about managing an eight pass translator.

<PRE>Hi All,

I've started to get my feet wet with ANTLR a little, and I've come across a
few things that I thought would be handled by lexer rules, but seem to be
handled in general by parser rules.  For example, most of the examples I've
seen handle numbers (floating, exponents, sign, etc) with parser rules,
whereas I would have expected these to have been handled by the lexer and
presented to the parser as one entity (ie, as just a number).  Am I
misunderstanding something?

John

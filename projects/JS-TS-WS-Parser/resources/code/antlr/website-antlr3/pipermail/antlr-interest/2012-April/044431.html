</I>&gt;<i> Moving to that website has a lot of advantages over an old-school mailing list, if you've ever used it. You can also treat it like a mailing list by asking for events when someone posts an antlr-tagged posting. It's set up very nicely for question-and-answer. It's also easier for people to post a question because they don't have to sign up for our mailing list. there is a good chance that they will have an account already at stackoverflow.com

Having a single place for storing old questions is quite compelling and stack exchange is an outstanding home.  One concern that I have is to how to facilitate general dialectic discussions.  I'm not sure stack exchange is a good place for that.

May I suggest stack exchange for user questions and a google groups dev list for tooling discussions?

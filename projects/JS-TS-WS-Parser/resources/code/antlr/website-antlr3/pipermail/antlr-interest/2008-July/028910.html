<PRE>Hi guys,
For an IDL compiler I wrote years ago (using JavaCC I think) I used
subject/observer to catch/store errors
in a data structure and a degenerate visitor to format them for output and
for asserting actual/expected errors/warnings
for destructive unit testing.

It turned out to be very useful during development and testing and forced me
to consider
the quality of error messages being produced.

If a standard error mechanism / data structure were added then support in
gunit
would be a useful related enhancement.

Regards,

Darach.

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that's always a potential problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  or that most people want the messages to print as they occur, so now there

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the collection would actually complicate things for new users, not simplify
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The choice is between:

</I>&gt;<i>

Lol.  Weird is all a matter of definition.

Hmm.  IIRC, the python grammar is very well defined, so shouldn't you just be 
able to take what's there and make it LL(k)? (hopefully without too much 
work?)

I'm actually working on a project for school that will handle the LR(1)-&gt;LL(1) 
conversion (where possible).  I'm using antlr as the tool and currently 
accepting a small subset of the antlr grammar.  I'm hoping to make it more of 
a general purpose grammar tool for analysis etc.

As far as the commas and Python, I presume you are talking about tuple 
packing/unpacking? Maybe on the print statement (indicating no newline)?

&gt;<i> I'll post something when it's ready for public consumption. :)

One of the reasons that I chose antlr is that I have heard that Python support 
is underway?  How is it coming?  Is there anything that I can do to help?  
I'll gladly test it out.  I tried out several different Python parsers 
(LR/LALR) for some work projects, but the debugging information they provided 
made them nearly useless so I ended up writing them by hand.  I recently ran 
across a few more, but was hoping I could wait for antlr to pick up Python 
support.

&gt;<i> Nice language, python....just a little kinky lexically. ;)
</I>
Oh yeah.  I still have to get used to the lexer parsing structure and how it 
stands apart from all the other ones that I have seen up to this point.  I 
suppose then that it wasn't the grammar that was giving you problems....

Thanks for the feedback and the tool.  I really like how I can look at LA(k) 
and FIRST(set).  They make it really easy to handle things that were 
previously much more difficult.

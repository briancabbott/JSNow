<PRE>I am trying it now. :)

Whoa.

Okay, at first it got even more confusing. I've learned that:

1. When Antlr talks about &quot;matching input&quot; it means from a particular 
location in the grammar -- not from the beginning of the file. So &quot;can 
match input '&amp;'&quot; really means &quot;can match input '&amp;' AFTER YOU GET HERE.&quot;

2. The arrows and diagrams shown in AntlrWorks are also &quot;after you get 
here.&quot;

3. The arrows do NOT show &quot;call&quot; behavior, but &quot;code flow&quot; behavior. For 
me, this meant several rules were included that wrapped my inner rules 
only so that the tool could show the code flow leaving those rules. 
There was a lot of &quot;arrow to the end of a rule&quot; that I had to learn to 
ignore.
 
4. When the arrow points to the START of a rule, that's where your 
problem is. In my case, the reason why it was possible to match '&amp;' 
multiple ways, along with 4 other warnings, was because I had forgot to 
specify that variable declarations had to end with a semicolon. It was 
telling me that the end of an initialization (int x = foo) could blur 
into the beginning of an expression statement (&amp;bar ;) forming something 
like &quot;int x = foo &amp;bar;&quot; as either a bitwise-and or as an initialization 
followed by a pointless computation of the address of bar.

Thanks, Johannes!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However -- and this is what confuses me -- I can't seem to see what

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so I'm wondering why antlr seems to feel that there are different

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Obviously, either there's a problem with antlr or a problem with my

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So my question is, how do I understand what the multiple alternatives

</I>&gt;<i> Did you try ANTLRworks? Use the &quot;check grammar&quot; option look for rules 
</I>&gt;<i> highlighted with red. Then look at syntax diagrams and decipher the 
</I>&gt;<i> different paths a grammar can take to get from point A to point B.

</I>&gt;<i> newline/whitespace rule look?  Possibly you've forgotten a set of
</I>&gt;<i> brackets or something so it's not doing what you think it's doing.

Well the rules are not mine :-) as I said the .g file is taken from
antlr site and I have not done much tinkering with it except for
inclusions of things into the AST that I need for my project that were
otherwise ommited with the ! notation.

The particular problem with ML_COMMENT I think I understand it now.
The problematic bit of the rule:

ML_COMMENT
	:	&quot;/*&quot; ~('*')
		(	options {
				generateAmbigWarnings=false;
			}
		:
			{ LA(2)!='/' }? '*'
		|	'\r' '\n'		{newline();}
		|	'\r'			{newline();}
		|	'\n'			{newline();}
		|	~('*'|'\n'|'\r')
		)*
		&quot;*/&quot;
		{$setType(Token.SKIP);}
	;


is this match on line two:
	:	&quot;/*&quot; ~('*')

so if one has a comment like this:
1. /*\n
2.  *\n
3.  */\n
4. int i = 0;

where \n is a new line. The line number of int i = 0; is 3. What
happens here is that when ~('*') is looked up and \n is found this
part of the rule matches but \n is swallowed without there being a
call to newline(); To test my theory I added an extra space like so:

1. /* \n
2.  *\n
3.  */\n
4. int i = 0;

note the extra space on the first line. And now the line number of int
i = 0; is 4. Because ~('*
) now matches the space and the subsequent part of the rule will match
'\n' and do the newline();

Anyway, I just took a look at the grammar that is published on the web site,
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/grammar/1090713067533/java15.g">http://www.antlr.org/grammar/1090713067533/java15.g</A> instead of the one
that comes with the src distribution, and it differs. In this
particular rule ~(*) is removed :-) and it works.

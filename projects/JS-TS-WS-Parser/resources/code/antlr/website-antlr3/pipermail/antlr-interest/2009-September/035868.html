</I>That doesn't sound like the correct way to do things to be honest, the 
AST is just the parsed elements and you probably need to do a lot more 
with these than just store them? Linguistically, that looks very 
confusing, you shoudl probably use a different operator than = :-)

</I>What are you trying to do/build? An interpreter? Basically, you should 
do as little as possible in the parser other than the basics such as 
build the symbol table if that is a a possibility (you know what all the 
types are while you are parsing etc). Generally, you would not want to 
duplicate the sub-tree for a symbol table but you can just reuse the 
pointer anyway as it is returned by the rule that parses your function. 
$rule.tree should do it I think.

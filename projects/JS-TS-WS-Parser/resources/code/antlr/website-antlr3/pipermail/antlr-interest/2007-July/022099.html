<PRE>Hi,

I just debugged a problem in my parser. I had rule in a tree parser that 
looked roughly like this:

term
[ returns Term t ]
   :   ^( ComplexTerm term termSequence )
	{
	    ...
	    Function function = asFunction($term.t)
	    ...
	}
   ;


What I found happening with this rule was that asFunction() was always 
being called with null.

When I changed the rule like this:

term
[ returns Term t ]
   :   ^( ComplexTerm funcTerm = term termSequence )
	{
	    ...
	    Function function = asFunction($funcTerm.t)
	    ...
	}
   ;


everything works. Looking at the generated Java code, I saw that the 
argument to asFunction() in the incorrectly functioning rule was 
just &quot;t&quot;, which is the locally declared variable that holds the rule's 
result / return value. In the second, working form of the rule, the 
argument to asFunction() is &quot;funcTerm&quot; (a local variable declared to 
hold the result of the recursive call to the &quot;term&quot; rule, of course).


So was ANTLR mistaken by the recursive use of the &quot;term&quot; rule, or was I 
mistaken in expecting the reference to $term.t to refer to the most 
closely enclosing (recursive) right-hand-side use of the &quot;term&quot; rule?

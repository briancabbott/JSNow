Yeah, but that can get cumbersome at the object level with recursion 
and alternatives.  It depends a great deal on the complexity of the 
language.  With SQL I had to do some contortions to get it to fit into 
a regular object structure.  However, then it was really easy to 
manipulate it from C++, which is what my client wanted.  In this case I 
think heterogenous trees were appropriate.

&gt;<i>

&gt;<i> Yikes!  Isn't &quot;computer.drives[1].position.head&quot; much simpler and
</I>&gt;<i> statically checkable?
</I>
Sure it is.  Tree grammars are appropriate for walking but not 
searching.  When you translate you typically walk the whole tree.  
Sometimes you index the tree with a symbol table.  But rarely do you 
say 'give me the first term of the third expression in the for loop.'

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Granted, tree parsers make this a lot easier, but I'm not using tree
</I>&gt;<i> parsers (and perhaps I'm just dense, but I don't think they will help

Still not sure what you are trying to do :)

I think you're being perfectly fair. Though the article says
&quot;SquirrelFish owes a lot of its design to some of the latest 
research in the field of efficient virtual machines&quot;, they really do seem
to have just figured out that compiled bytecode runs faster than interpreted
source code. Maybe it's the &quot;lazy&quot; runtime compilation that they feel is
leading edge, as that's only been mainstream for a decade or so.

It looks like very nice work, it's just that I don't think it's as new
an innovative as it sounds. I guess nothing is.

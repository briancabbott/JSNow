&gt;<i> &gt; 1) There is a major bug in 2.7.2 that prevents you from

</I>
This was mentioned previously by someone else in the group.  I just implemented what they suggested.  It just meant changing this:

  AST(const AST&amp; other) : ref(other.ref-&gt;increment()) {}

to this:
        
  AST(const AST&amp; other) : ref(0) {}

&gt;<i> &gt; 2) Even though I can associate heterogeneous types with tokens, ANTLR
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't respect them for synthetic tokens.  By &quot;respect&quot; I mean that it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't generate the appropriate factory initialization code (there is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; workaround for this by creating a dummy rule that utilizes the synthetic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tokens as terminals) and it doesn't allow you to operate on specific
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; members and methods for your heterogeneous ASTs in the production rules
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (because you have to manually create them so it has to use the factory and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; therefore uses a generic interface).  The former is what I was eluding to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at the end of the previous section on synthetic nodes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you could supply me with a small compileable grammar written as you
</I>&gt;<i> would expect things to be handled (no workarounds) then I can 
</I>&gt;<i> have a look.
</I>
The problem is, what I want won't compile.  Well, at least if I include everything I want it won't compile.  I'm attaching two versions of &quot;treewalk.g&quot; from the &quot;imagNodeAST&quot; example (for C++).  The first version will compile (in the ANTLR sense at least) but fails during C++ compilation because ANTLR uses a generic interface when I want it to be smart enough to use the specific interface.  Another version addresses something you mention later on...

&gt;<i> &gt; I think that with the exception of the C++ class hierarchy, 
</I>&gt;<i> much of this is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easy to address.  Looking at my grammar, things would be 
</I>&gt;<i> greatly simplified
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if the following were possible:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) Automatic construction of synthetic nodes via a syntax like:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; declaration&lt;AST=DeclarationNode&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   : type name &quot;;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Personally I'd wait for Loring's stuff before adding stuff 
</I>&gt;<i> like this. (I don't mind the ## = #( .. ) syntax too much) Maybe I'd go for Monty's
</I>&gt;<i> suggestion of a macro facility in antlr then it would be easy 
</I>&gt;<i> to make some sugar for this.
</I>
I'm using the ##=#(...) trick now.  That isn't so much of a burden.

&gt;<i> &gt; 2) Ability to reference heterogeneous methods and members , e.g.:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; declaration&lt;AST=DeclarationNode&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   : t:type name &quot;;&quot; { ##-&gt;setType(t-&gt;getTypeName()); }
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do not follow, this should already be supported. If it's not working it's
</I>&gt;<i> a bug.
</I>
I think you misunderstand me.  If I specify an AST for a *TOKEN*, e.g.

tokens {
  BLOCK&lt;AST=My_AST&gt;
}

Then I'm OK so long as BLOCK isn't imaginary.  If it is imaginary, you need to create a dummy rule to get ANTLR to generate the appropriate 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) Definitions of custom AST types should involve a minimum of code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agree.
</I>
I modified the treewalk.g file from the imagNodeAST example for C++.  You could be able to save these files in that directory and (assuming you can build the baseline example), simply rename this files to &quot;treewalk.g&quot; and see the issue list for each one.  Here is a breakdown of the included files:

MyAST.hpp:

  Needed to compile this stuff

treewalk1.g:

  This shows how heterogeneous ASTs should be created and used.  There are two problems with this version.  First, the factory initialization is not done correctly.  Second, I cannot access a specific method on my heterogeneous AST.

treewalk2.g:

  This version generates an appropriate factory initialization (by using the workaround of adding the dummy rule where BLOCK appears as a terminal in the rule).  Note that this version still suffers from the problem that the hetero specific method is still not accessible in the &quot;block&quot; rule.  I don't think this is a bug, I think it is impossible as long as you manually build the node.  This is because the manual construction relies on the factory interface which is generic.  I suppose you could inspect the &quot;BLOCK&quot; type and then add a cast at this point or circumvent the factory somehow.

treewalk3.g:

  This shows how I would like to do (i.e. associate specific AST types at rules).  You mention above that you think this is a bug if it isn't supported.  I would point out that ANTLR cannot compile this and I see no mention of this particular syntax in the ANTLR documentation.  As such, I don't think this is a bug...ANTLR simply cannot do this (currently).

&gt;<i> is this: the theoretical complexity is linear for ANTLR's basic LL and
</I>&gt;<i> yacc-n-friends LR-based stuff.  So, the thing you're fighting is the
</I>&gt;<i> constant on the front.  That is, how fast can you spin in a for-loop or
</I>&gt;<i> walk thru a state-machine.  Back in the 80's, tom pennello who works with
</I>&gt;<i> deremer (inventor of LALR) did an LALR to x86 machine code generator.
</I>&gt;<i> That damn thing was FAST!
</I>
I was tangentially involved with an assembler a long time ago.  It was a
multi-pass macro-assembler for x86 assembly language written in yacc/bison.
It wasn't as fast as we liked (since we had millions of lines of x86
assembly language code -- an entire OS and application suite :-)) so it was
profiled.  Putting in a special case in the read I/O routine so that it
understood and discarded comments all by itself (which, of course, is a
major hack).  Modifying that &quot;constant factor&quot; made the entire translation
on the order of 50% faster (and that was after tuning the base I/O routines
:<i>-).
</I>
Take care,
	John

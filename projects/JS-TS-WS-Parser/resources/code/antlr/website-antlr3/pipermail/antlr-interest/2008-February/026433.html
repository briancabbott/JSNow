</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Sure it is confusing. I fell into this 'xy' trap, too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If COLON is defined and STAR is defined, then creating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; another token for ':*' in a *parser* rule is confusing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It should be fixed in antlr.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; At least, antlr should emit 'anonymous token' warning[s].
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I prefer literals because of simplicity / readability.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The tool needs to be patched, not users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If I understand your &quot;problem&quot; I don't think this can be fixed. If you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; type ':*', how can ANTLR know you don't want ':*' as a single token.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because:
</I>&gt;<i>  - there is only one grammar file for both lexer and parser
</I>&gt;<i>  - ':*' is mentioned in a parser rule only
</I>&gt;<i>  - there are lexer rules in that same file for ':' and '*'
</I>&gt;<i>  so lexer rules can be combined automatically to support parser rules
</I>I don't really think ANTLR should guess that. That could result in
very weird behaviour when a literal you use in a parser happens to be
the combination of two lexer rules. And also, a literal in the parser
should refer to a single token not multiple tokens. ':*' and ':' '*'
should be referring to different things.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is perfectly valid to have ':', '*' and ':*' tokens, so this is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what ANTLR produces.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And emitting a warning just because you use a perfectly valid (if easily
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; misusable) construct doesn't seem right.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Unfortunately I don't think this is a case where ANTLR can protect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you from yourself.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps literals could be allowed in the parser but only to refer to tokens
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; defined in the lexer, generating an error otherwise. That should alleviate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; many (if not all) of the issues while still allowing the stylistic choice
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some seem to want.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tom.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Emitting a warning doesn't seem right, generating an error is better?
</I>&gt;<i> I feel OK with that. Although I actually think that allowing literals
</I>&gt;<i> in parser can enable to create some very simple grammars easier.
</I>&gt;<i> But magically creating tokens by default really is a bad choice.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps an option to explicitly allow creation of anonymous tokens
</I>&gt;<i> is the best solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Guntis
</I>My point was that as long as this is valid syntax it seems very
peculiar to give a warning (or error) just because that sort of syntax
is often misunderstood or misused.
I guess you could have an option and otherwise only allow literals
that were specified in the lexer. Though I'm not even sure I think
either of those is worth the effort (especially the option).
There should be (and probably is) introductory documentation that
details such things. This results from a basic misunderstanding as to
the separation of lexing and parsing, this crops up here and in other
places, it's something you just have to learn and once you do I think
the current arrangement is natural.

Tom.

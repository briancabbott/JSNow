Hi. It turns out that parsing in two dimensions is a bit tricky ;)  
antlr serializes trees too one-dimensional strings, injecting  
imaginary down and up nodes to represent structure. so, we need to be  
able to distinguish between

^(X Y Z)

and

^(X ^(Y Z))

A subtree is very different terms of lookahead from a linear list.  A  
B is different than ^(A B). Lookahead is AB on the first one (LL(2))  
and ADOWN on the second one.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given the original problem mentioned in the issue:
</I>&gt;<i>   input: ^(not ^(and ^(= a b) ^(= c d)))
</I>&gt;<i>   rule: ^('not' ^('and' c51=. c52=.)) -&gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see how this can be misinterpreted.  While processing the
</I>&gt;<i> 'and' subtree, it reads the first child node, discovers that it's
</I>&gt;<i> a subtree, reads the whole thing in and assigns the root node
</I>&gt;<i> (with dangling subtree) to c51.  Then it does the same for the
</I>&gt;<i> next subtree and c52.
</I>
Agreed. After playing around all day yesterday, I came to the  
conclusion that the wild-card should in fact mean single node or  
subtree, which is normally what you want. I have simply altered the  
analysis to consider wild-card as  really ^(. .*) :)

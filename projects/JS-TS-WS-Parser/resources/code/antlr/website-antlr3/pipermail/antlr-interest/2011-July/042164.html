<PRE>Hi 

 

I have been using the ANTLRWORKS plugin for IDEA for a some time now.  It seems like it is no longer being supported, as the version of ANTLRWorks is 1.3.1, and when I look at the ANTLR website, it looks like ANTLRWorks is at v1.4.2 now.

 

Has support for the plugin stopped?

 

If so, are most people just using ANTLRWorks as an external tool to their favoured IDE then?  I've just getting back into active ANTLR development again, and trying to figure out people are doing.

 

Thx.

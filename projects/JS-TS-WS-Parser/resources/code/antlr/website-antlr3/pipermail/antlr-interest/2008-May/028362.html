CALL FOR PAPERS

SAC'09 - ACM 2009 SYMPOSIUM ON APPLIED COMPUTING
March 8-12, 2009
Honolulu, Hawaii, USA
Technical Track on &quot;Programming Languages&quot;
***********************************************************************************

Over the past 23 years, the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing has  
become a primary forum for applied computer scientists, computer  
engineers, software engineers, and application developers from around  
the world to interact and present their work. SAC 2009 is sponsored by  
the ACM Special Interest Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP). For  
additional information, please check the SAC web page: <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2009">http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2009</A> 
.

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES (PL) TRACK (<A HREF="http://www.cis.uab.edu/bryant/">http://www.cis.uab.edu/bryant/</A> 
sac2009/)
A technical track on Programming Languages will be held at SAC'09. It  
will be a forum for engineers, researchers and practitioners  
throughout the world to share technical ideas and experiences relating  
to implementation and application of programming languages. Original  
papers and experience reports are invited in all areas of programming  
languages. Major topics of interest include but are not limited to the  
following:
&#8226; Compiling Techniques,
&#8226; Domain-Specific Languages,
&#8226; Formal Semantics and Syntax,
&#8226; Garbage Collection,
&#8226; Language Design and Implementation,
&#8226; Languages for Modeling,
&#8226; Model-Driven Development and Model Transformation,
&#8226; New Programming Language Ideas and Concepts,
&#8226; New Programming Paradigms,
&#8226; Practical Experiences with Programming Languages,
&#8226; Program Analysis and Verification,
&#8226; Program Generation and Transformation,
&#8226; Programming Languages from All Paradigms (Agent-Oriented, Aspect- 
Oriented, Functional, Logic, Object-Oriented, etc.),
&#8226; Visual Programming Languages.

GUIDELINES FOR SUBMISSION
Authors are invited to contribute original papers in all areas of  
experimental computing and application development relevant to the  
theme of the track. This includes the following categories of  
submissions:
1) Original and unpublished research work,
2) Reports of innovative applications to the arts, sciences,  
engineering, and business areas,
3) Reports of successful technology transfer to new problem domains,
4) Reports of industrial experience and demos of new innovative systems.

All submissions will be peer reviewed. Papers will be selected based  
on their originality, timeliness, significance, relevance and clarity  
of presentation. Accepted papers will be published in the symposium  
proceedings. A set of selected papers, which did not get accepted as  
full papers, will be accepted as poster papers and will be published  
as extended 2-page abstracts in the symposium proceedings. After the  
conference, selected accepted papers will be invited to a special  
issue of a prominent journal.

The following submission guidelines must be strictly followed:
Use the webpage <A HREF="http://sac.cs.iupui.edu/SAC2009/">http://sac.cs.iupui.edu/SAC2009/</A> to submit your paper.  
Submissions must follow the template available <A HREF="athttp://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2009/downloads09.htm">athttp://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2009/downloads09.htm</A> 
. The author(s) name(s) and address(es) must NOT appear in the body of  
the paper, and self-reference should be in the third person. This is  
to facilitate blind review. Only the title should be shown at the  
first page without the author's information. The manuscript file  
format should be PDF. The total number of final pages without any  
extra page charge (80 USD per page) is 5 (the maximum number of pages  
is 8). An abstract (.txt format) including the title of the paper at  
the beginning (without having any author's information) should be also  
submitted. If you have any problem to submit your paper via web,  
please contact Jeff Allen or track organizers.

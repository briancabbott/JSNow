<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; The problem is where to check for NCNAMEs and where not to. You
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; certainly have some parts in your grammar where you expect NCNAMEs and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some parts where you have to test for the operators. The knowledge where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that is appropriate and where not is not available to ANTLR.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To be honest, I don't follow you here. The check for NCNAMEs is correct in 
</I>&gt;<i> every case, and I do expect NCNAMEs in all those places. 
</I>
Sorry, my wording was a little bad. What I meant is &quot;when to interpret a
character sequence which is both a valid NCNAME and a valid keyword like
an NCNAME or a keyword, respectively&quot;.

&gt;<i> I guess you also meant s/operators/keywords/? Then yes, this knowledge is 
</I>&gt;<i> available, since the grammar contains e.g. (simplified)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> data_term : &quot;declare&quot; (&quot;ns-prefix&quot; NCNAME ASSIGN STRING)* LP (data_term)* RP
</I>&gt;<i>           | (...) =&gt; NCNAME (AT NCNAME)? (COLON NCNAME) LP (data_term)* RP
</I>&gt;<i>           | NCNAME
</I>&gt;<i>           ;
</I>
So, at the start of data_term, &quot;declare&quot; is a keyword, and the optional
NCNAME cannot be &quot;declare&quot;. For input &quot;declare&quot; &quot;ns-prefix&quot; then the
input &quot;declare&quot; is legal and an NCNAME. I think we'll end up with the
conclusion we already had - keyword free grammars are messy, and the
distinction between parser and lexer doesn't really hold for them.

&gt;<i> The big problem with this is that guessing won't pick it up and will thus 
</I>&gt;<i> fail. In the above grammar I need the guessing in the second line (left 
</I>&gt;<i> empty) to see if there is at least an LP coming up.
</I>
I think the only way to keep guessing working with such a language in
ANTLR 2 is to have a stateful lexer.

&gt;<i> But thanks for your help anyway!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, I just had an idea: what about switching testLiterals off completely 
</I>&gt;<i> in the lexer and (in the generated parser code) in every place where there's 
</I>&gt;<i> an 
</I>&gt;<i>   LA(1)==SOME_KEYWORD 
</I>&gt;<i> replace the code with 
</I>&gt;<i>   LA(1)==NCNAME &amp;&amp; testLiteralsTable(LA(1))==SOME_KEYWORD
</I>&gt;<i> ?
</I>&gt;<i> That would work, no? And it could be done with a little script?
</I>
You could also write:

data_term: { LA(1).getText().equals(&quot;declare&quot;) }? NCNAME &quot;ns-prefix&quot; ...
	| NCNAME
	;

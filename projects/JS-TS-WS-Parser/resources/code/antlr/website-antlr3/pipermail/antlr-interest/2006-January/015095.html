Chiming in late, but I have one remark to make:
ST isn't the view! It certainly is part of the view, but it's not the  
entire view. The code generator is the view.
ST simply gets rid of all those prints in your code and puts the  
parameterized text into one place. I personally have
used and written template systems (engines, whatever) for a few years  
now, and am very pleased with the approach.
If I understand your approach correctly, it seems to me that your  
&quot;patterns&quot; are some kind of templates, too.
To me they look like mini-grammars (sorry for that ;)) with  
integrated templates (the RHS of the '--&gt;').
The v's and x's are template variables and the rest of the text is  
copied verbatim. Are there any control structures
you use?

Regards,

Kay

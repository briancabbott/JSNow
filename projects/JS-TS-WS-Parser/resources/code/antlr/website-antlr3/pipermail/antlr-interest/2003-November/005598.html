<PRE>What I wanted to say was: If you have sematic actions associated to
your grammar that can be inserted (and of course executed) at any
point and you have a table driven approach you are in trouble. This is
because what I understand as the precomputation of a search tree into
a table combining certain *search* states. Extrapolating from what I
know about LR you have a problem when youe have a grammar like this:

a : A A { do something here } A A B ;
b : A A { do something different here } A A C ;

upon input

AAAAC

This is because the parser has no idea which action to execute here.
Now, my idea was to execute both and roll back the action of rule a as
soon as it is clear that rule b actually matches.

A bit clearer now?

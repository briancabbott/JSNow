<PRE>I have to say, I only recently bought the book, and have been using
ANTLRv3 for about the last 6 months (I started somewhere in the beta
cycle)

Before that I had never had any experience with language parsing, and
all I had was the on-line docs and this mailing list.

Without the book, I feel like I am now quite proficient with ANTLR,
and really only recently bought it to round out my knowledge of this
tool, and to give something back to Terrence.

As an OSS author myself, I am actually very impressed with the amount
of documentation that was and is available with ANTLR. and also for
the speediness in which he will personally respond to questions on the
mailing list (which usually ends up in the wiki afterwards).

This may well be just my opinion, but since I was able to take myself
from nothing to something with v3, without the book, is a fair
testament to the time and effort Terrence has put into all aspects of
this project.

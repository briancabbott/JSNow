&gt;<i> While I'm thinking about it, here is a list of things that would be
</I>&gt;<i> nice to have regarding AST's:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Allow for sub-rules to have there own root rather than always
</I>&gt;<i> rooting the super-rule.  This is described in the documentation as
</I>&gt;<i> labeled sub-rules, but apparently is not implemented.  Right now to
</I>&gt;<i> get the right AST struture you have to partition the rules to get the
</I>&gt;<i> right roots.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Allow rule references in addtion to token references to be rooted.
</I>&gt;<i>  This feature was described in my previous message.  Right now you may
</I>&gt;<i> have to flatten the rules to get the right roots.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Have a standard interface for separating/storing/retrieving
</I>&gt;<i> children to the left vs. right of the root so that token order can be
</I>&gt;<i> easily preserved.  Right now with the way ASTFactory does things, the
</I>&gt;<i> current interface can be used to get the token order correct, but the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;addChild&quot; definition must be changed (insert child at beginning
</I>&gt;<i> instead of end).  Instead, I think the interface and ASTFactory should
</I>&gt;<i> assume that the AST's keep order, but the implementation wouldn't have
</I>&gt;<i> to.  Maybe all that is needed is a redefinition of addChild (insert to
</I>&gt;<i> the left of the left children), and a few methods which return
</I>&gt;<i> separate left and right children lists (non-ordered ASTs would return
</I>&gt;<i> the whole list or nothing for these).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Consider using a more generic &quot;List&quot; like interface storing sibling
</I>&gt;<i> lists.  This way you can have implementations other than linked lists
</I>&gt;<i> and you can get easy random access.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Add some symbol table stuff.  It would be nice to be able to easily
</I>&gt;<i> store symbol table data in the AST.  I haven't thought through the
</I>&gt;<i> details yet, but I was thinking you'd have some suffix to say you
</I>&gt;<i> wanted something to be a key in a symbol table and the &quot;children&quot; ASTs
</I>&gt;<i> would be the value for this entry.  This could work similar to the &quot;^&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  AST operator, but instead of making a root with children, it would
</I>&gt;<i> make a map entry.
</I>

6. Make it simple to add extra tokens to the AST structure.  It seems
like the majority (all?) of the time you resort to the # actions for
making AST's, you just end up putting in extra tokens in.  Those #
actions seem hacky (and limited) anyways (like the $ stuff) - why not
just directly support inserting extra tokens.  So, instead of:

decl : ( TYPE ID )+ { #decl = #([DECL,&quot;decl&quot;], #decl); } ;

you could do:

decl : [DECL,&quot;decl&quot;]^ ( TYPE ID )+ ;

Maybe go ahead and just support an AST constructor call here to give
all the flexibility.  Doing it this new way seems much more
understandable.  That # stuff seems very ugly since it is merged in
with Java and has syntax nothing like java (at least the $ stuff is
closer).

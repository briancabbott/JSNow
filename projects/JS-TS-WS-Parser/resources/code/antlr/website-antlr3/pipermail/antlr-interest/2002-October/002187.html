<PRE>I have tried recently to build antlr on Solaris (5.7) using gcc
(2.95.2 19991024) and jdk 1.3.1. In summary I think that the build
process needs to be addressed asap and at the least to be documented
properly. I get all sorts of problems, listed below:

1- version 2.7.2a4. All seemed to build ok apart from the make install
part which fails with an error related to actions of the install-sh
script. For instance, the jars are all placed on the top level
directory and make gets confused when trying to call
'../scripts/install-sh' to put the jars to the designated directory,
when it should instead call ./scripts/install-sh

Also if you dare do a 'make clean' at any point you loose the jars and
subsequent make falls over.

For the existence of the jars themselves, I found the process a bit
confusing: when I untarred the tarball, there was an antlr.jar at the
top level directory but subsequent invocations (through the
out-of-box) Makefile to

java -cp /user/ebiris/installs/antlr-2.7.2a2/antlrall.jar antlr.Tool 
 antlr.g

falls over, since the antlrall.jar is not there. I had to issue a
mkalljar first to get the jar, and then make would proceed.

Also checking in the accompanying install.html does not help much...
There is also an inconsistency in that file as jdk1.1 does not work
with the antlr code any longer (errors regarding hashset class which
does not exist in jdk 1.1).

I hope someone can enlighten me about the compilation errors above ...
I will try to patch things up but the process for antlr.jar and
antlrall.jar construction is not very clear to me.


Thanks

Elias

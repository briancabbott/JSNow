Hi Ter &amp; Nita,
 
I've been thinking about having a website where users can input the language code which they can write in any text editor and get an output which might list the errors in the code or something of that order. This would enable a user to test the ability of my compiler without downloading and using any jar files etc. 
 
I would like to know if there is any recommended approach already to achieve this.
 
Bharath.

Hi Octavian,

Cool idea.  I built a language for generating VRML once and my
colleague Tim Rohaly set up a page where you could type in IVL
(pronounced &quot;evil&quot;) and it spit back VRML like a service. :)

We're hoping to set up a &quot;service&quot; at antlr.org that ANTLRWorks can use
to grab grammar fragments in order to help you get a new grammar
together quickly.

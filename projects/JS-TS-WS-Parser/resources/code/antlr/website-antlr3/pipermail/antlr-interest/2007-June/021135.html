<PRE>Where has the old antlr documentation gone? Some of us are still using
2.7!
 
I can't find anything about lexer predicates.
 
In parsing C++ I'm trying to remove asm statements in the lexer as
though they were comments.
 
I'm using a predicate in the lexer as follows,
 
(&quot;__asm&quot;|&quot;_asm&quot;|&quot;asm&quot;) LPAREN)=&gt;
 
but this will only match &quot;asm(&quot; provided there is no space between
&quot;asm&quot; and &quot;(&quot;.
 
What's the problem here and how could I get over it?
 
Thanks,
 
David Wigg

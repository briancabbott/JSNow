<PRE>Does this requires a modified version of antlr?  I see antlr 2.7.4 for
download.  Does this replace the one from the antlr.org site? And then
there is org.antlr.core and org.antlr.ui, with different release
numbers.  What parts do I need and how do I install?  Am I missing the
instructions somewhere?

I just installed it today using the update site. I don't know about
support for antlr 2.7.5, at least 2.7.4 is included. I also didn't try
anything except the editor and the outline etc. (e.g., the UI) - but
that works well.

Well, I've received several messages now from the list where I was 
named as an explicit recipient as well as it being sent to the 
list as a whole -- and I only ever received one copy (the one sent 
privately; there was no additional message from the list).

I'm not sure why it would be behaving differently for you (unless 
possibly you're using a different email to post than the one you 
subscribed with).  Maybe you need to have a look at your user 
options for the list?

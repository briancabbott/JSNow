<PRE>Robert,

Thank you for your response! I tried your suggestion, but I'm afraid it only succeeded in moving the problem :(

My grammar now looks like...

	equalsCondition :
		&quot;is&quot; (&quot;a&quot;)? relativeParameter
		{
			addEqualsCondition();
		}
	;

	notEqualsCondition :
		&quot;is&quot; &quot;not&quot; relativeParameter
		{
			addNotEqualsCondition();
		}		
	;

...and when parsing something like...

	if Item is not blank

...it gets confused saying...

	line 5:12: unexpected token: not

...because, presumably, it is going down the path of the first equalsCondition upon seeing the &quot;is&quot;, not the second notEqualsCondition. I'd really rather avoid having to do something like...

	equalsOrNotEqualsCondition :
		&quot;is&quot; (
			( &quot;a&quot; )? relativeParameter
			{
				addEqualsCondition();
			}
			|
			&quot;not&quot; relativeParameter
			{
				addNotEqualsCondition();
			}
			)
	;

...especially when JavaCC handles this so much more compactly.

Your suggestions are much appreciated,

Richard.

The way to do this in ANTLR would be leave only your IDENTIFIER token in
the Lexer and then in the parser refer to your literal tokens directly.
You may need to set testLiterals=true in the options, but I think this
is the default. What ANTLR does is maintain a list of any string
literals used in the grammar and whenever it finds a token it tests the
text against this list of literals to see if it's just a plain old
identifier or if it's a special keyword.

Something like:

	class BusinessParser extends Parser;

	options
	{
		k=1;
	}

	equals :
         &quot;is&quot; (&quot;the&quot; &quot;same&quot; &quot;as&quot;)?
         |
         &quot;the&quot; &quot;same&quot; &quot;as&quot;
         |
         &quot;are&quot; (&quot;the&quot; &quot;same&quot; &quot;as&quot;)?
         |
         &quot;of&quot;
      ;

	class BusinessLexer extends Lexer;

	options
	{
		k=1;
	}

	IDENTIFIER: ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'|'_'|'$')
('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'|'_'|'0'..'9'|'$')*;

Subject: [antlr-interest] ANTLR equivalent of JavaCC Lexer behaviour?

Dear All,

I am looking to migrate an existing grammar from JavaCC to ANTLR, but am
having difficultly with the Lexer.

Specifically, my grammer is very 'English-y', and while JavaCC appears
to employ (I'm guessing here) a rather forgiving 'longest match' Lexer,
ANTLR warns me to specify an actual 'k=x' lookahead number. I have found
this number needs to be pretty large (17) to stop the warning, at which
point ANTLR seems to crash (and besides
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/doc/options.html">http://www.antlr.org/doc/options.html</A> warns against it, saying 'at large
depths will include almost everything').

Here is a snippet of my working JavaCC grammer...

	PARSER_END( BusinessLanguage )

	TOKEN :
	{
		&lt; EQUALS: &quot;is&quot; | &quot;is the same as&quot; | &quot;the same as&quot; |
&quot;are&quot; | &quot;are the same as&quot; | &quot;of&quot; &gt;
	|	&lt; NOT_EQUALS: &quot;is not&quot; | &quot;is not the same as&quot; &gt;
	|	&lt; LESS_THAN: &quot;is less than&quot; &gt;
	|	&lt; IDENTIFIER: &lt;LETTER&gt; (&lt;LETTER&gt;|&lt;DIGIT&gt;)* &gt;
	}  	

...and the sort of thing it parses...

	if Status is &quot;Closed&quot; then error &quot;Already closed&quot;
	if Version is less than 1 then error &quot;Version cannot be less
than 1&quot;

...and here is what I tried in ANTLR...

	class BusinessLexer extends Lexer;

	options
	{
		k=17;
	}

	EQUALS: &quot;is&quot; | &quot;is the same as&quot; | &quot;the same as&quot; | &quot;are&quot; | &quot;are
the same as&quot; | &quot;of&quot;;
	NOT_EQUALS: &quot;is not&quot; | &quot;is not the same as&quot;;
	LESS_THAN: &quot;is less than&quot;;
	IDENTIFIER: ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'|'_'|'$')
('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'|'_'|'0'..'9'|'$')*;

Clearly there is a lot of contention in this grammer, but is there a way
to get the equvialent JavaCC behaviour? I would rather not have to code
something along the lines of...

	(&quot;is&quot; (&quot;not&quot; | &quot;less than&quot;)) | (&quot;are&quot; ( &quot;the same as&quot; ))

Your wisdom is most appreciated :)

Regards,

Richard.

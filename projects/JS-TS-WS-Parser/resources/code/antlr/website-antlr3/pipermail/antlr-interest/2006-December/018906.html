Thanks!  It's been a long 3.5 years (working every day including  
weekends except for the past few months). I really do think I  
understand parser generators now and this tool is the culmination of  
everything I've learned about parsing and just plain coding in general.

</I>
Should I up the price of the book? ;)

The development editor and the other hip cats at pragmatic  
programmers bookshelf are evaluating the book as we speak and  
hopefully first week of January or second week you'll have a beta  
version that includes most of the stuff.  Just posted a tutorial  
(with almost no text) on building a tree-based interpreter.  I think  
you will enjoy... requires the absolute up to the second version of  
the tool but hey ;) I made a huge number of improvements today to  
support building interpreters.  I decided this was too much for the  
current book, which is really a reference manual.  The next book will  
be all about building domain specific languages.

&gt;<i> A merry christmas to you and your family...
</I>
Thanks, Bill.  Happy holidays. :)

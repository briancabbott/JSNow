</I>&gt;<i> way of thinking involved.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Someone writing their first 10-line program in a language that's new to 
them will almost
surely not be relying on their knowledge of some other language that 
they know. Instead,
they'll probably be typing in a simple (Hello, world) program from a 
textbook or
from their notes in a class, or from some documentation.

When it comes to &quot;getting it working&quot;, it's all about the quality of the 
error messages.
Javac's messages are great...probably something like &quot;missing semicolon&quot; 
with a little
arrow showing where the problem is.
&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  How many times do we see people ask &quot;why isn't this 10-line grammar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  working?&quot; or &quot;how do I print out an AST nicely?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These kinds of questions are parts of the learning process, not
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily de facto evidence of a problem with ANTLR. Where we can
</I>&gt;<i> help is identifying common misperceptions about ANTLR and describing
</I>&gt;<i> those parts in the correct way (e.g. how to think about structuring
</I>&gt;<i> your lexer definitions) and defining key ideas in a way that people
</I>&gt;<i> can become more self-sufficient with the documentation.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Look at, say, the development team for javac. You've got dozens of 
people working for
over a decade on it, with only part of the work being on the &quot;hard 
stuff&quot; - the parsing and
bytecode generation. There are also people working, full time for years, 
on making it
&quot;user friendly&quot;. ANTLR doesn't have that. Obviously, Terence isn't 
superhuman and can't
do it all. But unless you've got someone doing that work, ANTLR will not 
be as user-friendly
as it could be.
&gt;<i> I would not, as has been suggested, try to lay a simpler face on
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR. The tool is designed very cleanly and simply; there's a clear
</I>&gt;<i> connection between when you write in the grammar and what you get from
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR (assuming your mental model of the app is correct.) Putting a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;simplifying&quot; layer on top can introduce assumptions that actually
</I>&gt;<i> make the result harder to understand and work with.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Again comparing to, say, javac: There's a clear connection and mental 
model there, too:
you put in valid Java syntax and get out a working program. There is 
*no* bytecode in the
mental model. By contrast, with ANTLR, you start off expecting to 
provide a valid grammar
as input and a working lexer/parser as output - that's the mental model 
you want. What you
actually often get as output is generated code for a grammar which you 
must look at and understand
in order to get your working parser.

I realize having ANTLR generate readable code is better than not (see 
lex and yacc). My point is
that I think ANTLR could be made easier to use, to the point where you 
really don't need to
understand the generated code. Sounds impossible, I know, but it's 
possible to write Java
without understanding bytecode. I don't picture an additional 
&quot;simplifying layer&quot;, just many years
of hard &quot;usability&quot; work with real users working on real problems.
&gt;<i> The hardest part of writing good conceptual documentation is to make
</I>&gt;<i> sure it's absolutely correct. I'm happy to draft it, if I can get
</I>&gt;<i> reviewers who really know ANTLR all the way through (Kay, Ter, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I prefer documentation that's not conceptual, but rather concrete. I 
also prefer documentation
that's understandable over documentation that's absolutely correct. But 
hey, that's just me I guess.

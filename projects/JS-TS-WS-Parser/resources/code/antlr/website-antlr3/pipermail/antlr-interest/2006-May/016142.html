Great! let's start a faq.  I just read

<A HREF="http://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151114">http://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151114</A>

and it looks like we want this approach (2nd paragraph):
&quot;Another simple approach is to use subpages where each entry becomes  
its own page. Typically such an FAQ will have a main page, a series  
of topic pages which break the FAQ into sections, and then the  
individual entries. Adding a new entry now just involves adding a new  
page to the correct topic page. Each topic page will list its  
children so they will be automatically updated. This solution scales  
more naturally than the first approach and allows comments to be  
added to an individual entry. The one downside is that each entry can  
only live within one topic which is not a restriction of the first  
approach.

The approach used by this FAQ is to use the power of Confluence's  
labels. As with the previous approach, each entry is added to a topic  
page which is added to the main page. However, instead of listing the  
children of a page, each topic page lists all entries that have  
specified a particular label using the contentbylabel macro. Now an  
entry can appear under multiple topics by specifying multiple labels  
on its page. This FAQ uses a convention of prefixing all labels with  
'faq_' to avoid collisions with other labels in the space.&quot;

Ok, i started it:

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/ANTLR+v3+FAQ">http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/ANTLR+v3+FAQ</A>

There are topic subpages and each faq entry has labels that indicate  
which of multiple topics it can be in.  There are subtopic pages to  
which you add new subpages.  Put the faq entry in the primary topic's  
topic subpage but you can put labels to indicate what other topics  
it's in.  Please look at how I've done this with faq_label.

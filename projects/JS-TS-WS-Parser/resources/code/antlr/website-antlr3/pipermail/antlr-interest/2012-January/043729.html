<PRE>ANTLR is currently in Perforce which also tracks files only, so it's
something he's already used to working with.

</I>observations on several years' evaluation of features, load-testing and
hosting for several of the leading FOSS DVCS tools, I saw Sam Harwell''s
note and realized that my experience with Hg must be out of date and that I
needed to remedy that.  While I did not make time to stress the current Hg
today, I must say they have come a loooong way of late -- particularly on
the documentation and support fronts.  Mas kudos to the Hg team.  I am still
not a fan of Hg simply because it chooses by design not treat directories as
first class objects [1].  

I'll have to investigate to see if that bugs me.

&gt;<i> That said, the right tool for the job depends on the job and who's doing
</I>it.  For most of us, it won't matter one bit which DVCS Ter  chooses.  The
hosting solution does matter, just because it saves Ter from daily requests
for tarballs.  And bitbucket works fine.

yeah and it means better access for you folks.

&gt;<i> [1] This is a serious issue for some shops.  If yours is one of them, you

<A HREF="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/mercurial-in-daily-use.html">http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/mercurial-in-daily-use.html</A> -- read the
rationalization there, and pay special attention to the comments in the
section entitled &quot;Mercurial tracks files, not directories.&quot;  

uh oh. is it hard to rename a dir? don't care about empty dirs.  hmm. this
seems to work:

hg rename doc docs

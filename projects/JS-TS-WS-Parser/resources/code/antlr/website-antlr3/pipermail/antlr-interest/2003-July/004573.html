<PRE>I'd like to propose enhancing ANTLR to explicitly
support comments.

The proposal is here:
<A HREF="http://jazillian.com/antlr/antlrComments.html">http://jazillian.com/antlr/antlrComments.html</A>

I realize that theoretically, a &quot;compiler-compiler&quot;
shouldn't deal with comments. But it just seems like it's
a big enough real-world issue (witness the countless
&quot;How do I handle comments&quot; posts) that it should be dealt with.

It seems like a couple of small changes to ANTLR could
be made to have ANTLR-generated lexers attach comments to
Tokens, without breaking any existing ANTLR-based apps.

Let me know what you think of the idea, even if you think
&quot;Blasphemy!&quot;

Andy

<PRE>I'm hoping the non-Java targets can be developed and maintained independently from the core ANTLR 4 repository, with absolutely no target files included in antlr/antlr4 on GitHub. In this case, we could have a standard target distribution layout and locate things via the classpath. I'll certainly be building the C# and C++ targets from this perspective.

I don't want to rain on anyone's parade but maintaining an ANTLR target is a LOT of work and mist people get bored/dissatisfied/upset/married/divorced/etc and we end up with half finished targets or ones that fall away - JavaScript, python, ruby,
C++ in v3 for instance.

OK, so this is Parrr (pun intended) fir the course and we want anyone and everyone to have a go. However, I think that for v4, it would be helpful to have something akin to a commissioning or approval process such that people could see whether a target was an experiment vs production quality.

It could be as simple as not including a target in a code release unless it is known to be good and up to date. The other targets you could download and use, but that in itself would tell you not to put too much faith in it.

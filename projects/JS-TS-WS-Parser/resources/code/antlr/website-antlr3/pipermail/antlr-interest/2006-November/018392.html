<PRE>Hi,
 
Not sure if algorithms were discussed. Just some notice about Ter,  yourself
and incremental analysis.
 
I'm not actually looking for anything in particular. Just curious about
differences with what was already possible [to tack on manually] with 2.7.x.
Sounds like it's the same just co-opting memoization.

Its gonna be the same algorithm as inside ANTLR Studio, though we are gonna
do a fair bit of tweaking to make it more generic.
I personally dont remember posting anything abt the algorithm on the list,
but if you can find something thats great for you :)

Hi,
 
Ok. I remember now that there may have been something posted to the list a
while back. One quick question, was it going to be _very_ different
(conceptually and implementation-wise) from what you did with ANTLR Studio?

Well, actually I was supposed to publish the paper along with Terence after
we implement it for antlr 3.
So everything is on hold right now :(

Hi,
 
Can you go ahead and publish just how this was supposed to work?. Perhaps
build a one-off V3 release with incremental lex/parse support?

Hi,
 Yes, we were originally planning to add the support for incremental parsing
in antlr 3, but since Terence has been busy with other stuff i  am unsure
whether it will be included in the first release or not.

I was reading the  Prashant Deva's article on ibm site and he was talking of
incremental lexing and parsing. I was wondering if ANTLR has any support
for it. If not is this something that would be supported in 3.0?

A discussion on how one would approch the problem given ANTLR as
the tool - for parser and lexer generation - would also be helpfull.

Thanks,
Alex.

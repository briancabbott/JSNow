<PRE>Hi Steven,

&gt;<i> &gt; Can you build the &quot;antlr.net-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2.7.2a4.sln&quot; solution?. It includes the most tested example -
</I> &quot;java&quot;
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you are referring to the solution file under lib\csharp it won't 
</I>build on any
&gt;<i> system we have. That was a major concern that we might have a bad 
</I>system
&gt;<i> configuration or install. In the version we downloaded there are no 
</I>errors in
&gt;<i> the unzip process. In the panel under JavaParser items like the 
</I>JavaLexer.cs,
&gt;<i> TokenTypes etc are all incorrect.
</I>
The &quot;missing&quot; files are ANTLR generated files. They are generated by 
running NAnt in the examples\csharp\java directory. This invokes 
ANTLR itself - as specified in the NAnt java.build file - against the 
java.g and java.tree.g files in the directory to generate 
JavaLexer.cs, JavaRecognizer.cs,...etc.

&gt;<i> So we have tried building just the runtime
</I>&gt;<i> portion to see if we have a versioning issue. When we do that we 
</I>get System.Byte
&gt;<i> is not defined or imported. We thought about combining files that 
</I>are missing
&gt;<i> from other version but that gets to be problematic even if it works.
</I>
'System.Byte' and it's alias 'byte' aren't used anywhere in the 
antlr.runtime source files. Even if they were, it wouldn't be a 
problem since VS.NET loads System.dll by default since no programs 
would run without the types in the System namespace.

&gt;<i> We have had no problems compiling and running sample code from the 
</I>net or books
&gt;<i> so it's not an obvious issue.
</I>
What edition of VS.NET are you using?

&gt;<i> &gt; PPS   What system produced the output messages included with your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; previous posting?. I thought it looked interesting at the time but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; forgot to ask in my reply  ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have identical results on a gateway laptop and another running 
</I>on IBM
&gt;<i> Netvista P4's.
</I>
&lt;SNIP&gt;

I meant software system. What build/logging package was used?. Sorry 
for the confusion.

Cheers!,

Micheal

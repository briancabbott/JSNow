  Condi! Nice to see you. What's happening?
Condi:
  Sir, I have the report here about the new leader of China.
George:
  Great. Lay it on me.
Condi: Hu is the new leader of China.
George:
  That's what I want to know.
Condi:
  That's what I'm telling you.
George:
  That's what I'm asking you. Who is the new leader of China?
Condi:
  Yes.
George:
  I mean the fellow's name.
Condi:
  Hu.
George:
  The guy in China.
Condi:
  Hu.
George:
  The new leader of China.
Condi:
  Hu.
George:
  The Chinaman!
Condi:
  Hu is leading China.
George:
  Now whaddya' asking me for?
Condi:
  I'm telling you Hu is leading China.
George:
  Well, I'm asking you. Who is leading China?
Condi:
  That's the man's name.
George:
  That's who's name?
Condi:
  Yes.
George:
  Will you or will you not tell me the name of the new leader of
  China?
Condi:
  Yes, sir.
George:
  Yassir? Yassir Arafat is in China? I thought he was in the Middle
  East.
Condi:
  That's correct.
George:
  Then who is in China?
Condi:
  Yes, sir.
George:
  Yassir is in China?
Condi:
  No, sir.
George:
  Then who is?
Condi:
  Yes, sir.
George:
  Yassir?
Condi:
  No, sir.
George:
  Look, Condi. I need to know the name of the new leader of China.
  Get me the Secretary General of the U.N. on the phone.
Condi:
  Kofi?
George:
  No, thanks.
Condi:
  You want Kofi?
George:
  No.
Condi:
  You don't want Kofi.
George:
  No. But now that you mention it, I could use a glass of milk. And
  then get me the U.N.
Condi:
  Yes, sir.
George:
  Not Yassir! The guy at the U.N.
Condi:
  Kofi?
George:
  Milk! Will you please make the call?
Condi:
  And call who?
George:
  Who is the guy at the U.N?
Condi:
  Hu is the guy in China.
George:
  Will you stay out of China?!
Condi:
  Yes, sir.
George:
  And stay out of the Middle East! Just get me the guy at the U.N.
Condi:
  Kofi.
George:
  All right! With cream and two sugars. Now get on the phone.
(Condi picks up the phone.)
Condi:
  Rice, here.
George:
  Rice? Good idea. And a couple of egg rolls, too. Maybe we should
  send some to the guy in China. And the Middle East. Can you get
  Chinese food in the Middle East?

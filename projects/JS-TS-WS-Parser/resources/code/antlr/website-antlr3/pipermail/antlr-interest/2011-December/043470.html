<PRE>Hi Eric,

 

An early release of ANTLRWorks 2 should definitely be available with the
first public (preview) releases of ANTLR 4. So far all of the work has been
on the Java version. I'm only planning to begin the C# and C++ ports after
the code &quot;settles down a bit,&quot; which will probably be sometime after the
initial alpha release.

 

Sam

Subject: ANTLR v4 C#

 

Hi Sam,

 

I know you and the others are busy working on ANTLR v4, and from looking at
the repository code, it looks like it will be another significant step
forward.

 

If these questions are being asked to early, or you want to hold off until
an announcement is ready, I understand.

 

I am only asking them because I am at cross roads and ANTLR v4, even in a
development version, might be a better path for me to take at this time for
a problem I am trying to solve using ANTLR.

 

Currently my understanding is that ANTLR v4 should be ready as a alpha in a
month or two, do you know if this is still true?

 

Will the C# target be ready at that time?

 

Will ANTLRworks v2 be ready at that time?

 

Will there be plug-ins for Visual Studio 2010?

 

 

Thanks,  Eric

 

 

 

 

</PRE>

Hi Bart,

That is good suggestion.
I have not done this yet because Jim Idle said he would help, and he has some familiarity with this project.
Still waiting for Jim though.

Rgs, James.

Hi James,

Hi Bart and all ....

The main no viable alternative errors occur around line 25 of Smalltalk.g
in the rule:

method returns [Method n]
   
 :    o = NAME c= '_class_'? '&gt;&gt;'  messagePattern '[' primitive? 
temporaries? statements  ']' {$n = MethodFactory.create($o.text, 
$c.text, $messagePattern.n, $primitive.n, $temporaries.n, 
$statements.n);}
    ;

To get started with building and 
parsing you can either use Antrl works or the getting started here: 
<A HREF="http://www.redline.st/discover/getting-started.html">http://www.redline.st/discover/getting-started.html</A>
The project sources are here:  <A HREF="https://github.com/redline-smalltalk/redline-smalltalk">https://github.com/redline-smalltalk/redline-smalltalk</A>


In  a nutshell there are a few binarySymbol methods that cause this rule to break with a &quot;no viable&quot; alternative.

If you goto the file Magnitude.st and change line 14 from 

- \&gt; aMagnitude


to

- &gt; aMagnitude

You will then start to get the error.

If you were to make the line

- , aMagnitude

That will cause the error as well and it should not.

The second error I get is on the same rule. Essentially I changed the file PreProcessor.g to spit out a

'_class_' rather than 'class' to overcome a no viable alternative error I was getting. Id like to make sure
the preprocessor did NOT put out _class_ and that the method pattern rule on line 25 of Smalltalk.g

was ok with 'o = NAME c= 'class'? '&gt;&gt;'  messagePattern'

Not it is ok for a method to look like the following:

- class
  ^ nil

You could modify Magnitude.st to have a method like this for testing.


Rgs, James.


If I strip your `Smalltalk.g` file from all custom code, copy the `Magnitude.st`, and generate a small main class to let the parser only parse the `Magnitude.st`  file:

    import org.antlr.runtime.*;
    public class Main {      public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {        SmalltalkLexer lexer = new SmalltalkLexer(new ANTLRFileStream(&quot;Magnitude.st&quot;));
        SmalltalkParser parser = new SmalltalkParser(new CommonTokenStream(lexer));        parser.program();      }    }
    java -cp antlr-3.3.jar org.antlr.Tool Smalltalk.g 
    javac -cp antlr-3.3.jar *.java    java -cp .:antlr-3.3.jar Main
I get the following error (without changing anything to the input file!):
    Magnitude.st line 5:2 no viable alternative at input '&lt;'

I'm probably doing something wrong, but I don't feel much like cloning a Gith-repo, building it all with maven etc. 
If you could post a self-containable grammar file (including a main method and without any custom code, or accompanying Main class as I posted) and could clearly indicate what goes wrong, and how you think it should be parsed, your chances in getting an answer would increase greatly, I think.

Regards,
Bart.

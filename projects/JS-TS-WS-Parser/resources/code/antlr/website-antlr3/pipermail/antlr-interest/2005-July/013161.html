</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [antlr-interest] Expression grammar issues (typecasts, method
</I>&gt;<i> calls)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a brand-new ANTLR user, and I'm still learning the ropes. I've
</I>&gt;<i> been working on a grammar for the expression portion of a scripting
</I>&gt;<i> language, and I'm having some issues supporting typecasts and method
</I>&gt;<i> calls that are driving me slowly insane. I'm certain that they're just
</I>&gt;<i> due to my unfamiliarity with ANTLR, and I'd very much appreciate any
</I>&gt;<i> help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't want to include the grammar inline and spam everyone, so if
</I>&gt;<i> you're interested in helping bail me out you can find it at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://hippo.sourceforge.net/hippo.g">http://hippo.sourceforge.net/hippo.g</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's only the skeletal expression evaluator at this point, with very
</I>&gt;<i> little tree work done except for a few minor changes to make the
</I>&gt;<i> output of ast.toStringTree() a bit more helpful to me. The expression
</I>&gt;<i> parser is based on the Java 1.5 parser available on antlr.org.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, and if it's at all useful, my implementation language is Java.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are two commented-out lines in the grammar, one in
</I>&gt;<i> unaryExpression and one in primaryExpression. Grep down for &quot;typecast&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> to find the first, and &quot;func&quot; to find the second. When either or both
</I>&gt;<i> of these lines are uncommented, parsing fails with an &quot;unexpected
</I>&gt;<i> token: null&quot; exception.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I said, I'm very new to ANTLR and feeling pretty lost. I assume
</I>&gt;<i> that my problems stem from the fact that both the typecast and the
</I>&gt;<i> function call specs use parenthesis, as do expressions, but I have no
</I>&gt;<i> idea what the real issue is. Any suggestions, whether for these
</I>&gt;<i> specific lines or for basic problems with the expression grammar,
</I>&gt;<i> would be much appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
</I>&gt;<i>

Hi,

It looks to be your actions, although I can't say for sure without further
testing. 

unaryExpression
	: INC^ unaryExpression
	| DEC^ unaryExpression
	| BITWISE_NOT^ unaryExpression
	| LOGICAL_NOT^ unaryExpression
	//| pl:PAREN_LEFT^ builtInType PAREN_RIGHT! unaryExpression
{#pl.setText(&quot;typecast&quot;);}
	| postfixExpression
	;

These actions are spread around in a few places; I'm guessing you have just
started adding them in.

Firstly, you probably don't need to use '#' in a normal parser, as this sort
of thing is only needed for tree parsers, so you can remove these. Secondly,
I'm not sure if you can do a setText() at this point. Try taking out the
'#', and if that doesn't work, remove the actions temporarily to see if that
makes any difference.

Cheers,

Nigel

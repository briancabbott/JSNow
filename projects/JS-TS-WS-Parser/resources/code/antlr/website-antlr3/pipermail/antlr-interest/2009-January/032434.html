<PRE>This isn't really isn't the list for the topic of whether or not C++
should/shouldn't support ___. I'm saying this primarily because it's a
grinding point for various people and sure to lead to harsh feelings
(expressed in replies or not). For the sake of creating an ANTLR target
(I think that's the real goal?), you have a few options. If you simply
want to disallow finally code in the grammar when the C++ target is
used, make the template for finally code spit out the following if the
finally code is not blank.

#error The C++ target does not support 'finally' blocks in grammars. Use
RAII instead.

I'm not suggesting that C++ should drop support for RAII. I'm saying  
it's stupid that it doesn't also support finally.

C++ is about making it easier to write complex code. It can be argued  
that it's syntactic sugar (as is any language). Not supporting finally  
means often times forcing the user to write more code, not less, to  
accomplish a thing.

I also love Java, and wish it supported RAII (but not at the expense  
of finally). There's no reason not to have both.

Don't get me started on those. I had planned to move to one reference
counter after 2.7.4 release. Someone contributed a pretty nifty
replacement but I didn't get it to work for 2.7.5 release so I had to
revert to the old ones just to get the release out. (The new one
worked ok, but I needed to do some tricky changes to the codegenerator
for heterogeneous AST's and that's not something I want to do 1-2
weeks before releasing a prerelease)

&gt;<i> Among these, the ref_ptr is most feature rich
</I>&gt;<i> (ASTRefCount is similar, but hard coded for use with
</I>&gt;<i> AST class, and TokenRefCount is, I believe, adaptation
</I>&gt;<i> in 2.7.5 of ref_ptr (of development snapshot build)
</I>&gt;<i> for use with Token class [why???]). RefCount is most
</I>&gt;<i> simple and non-intrusive, but most inflexible one.
</I>
For heterogenous AST's the current reference counters allow some dirty
casting (up and down). TokenRefCount was added this release just to
get the tokenstream rewrite engine going, I must admit it's a
dirty/shamefull copy paste. Previously the C++ runtime didn't work
100% (convenient) with custom token classes. Considering time I had to
or take out the tokenstream rewrite engine or make changes to the
reference counter. (2.7.5 main goal is to get the python codegen out)

&gt;<i> Is there any specific reason for all of three to
</I>&gt;<i> co-exist, or can we do away with all and standardize
</I>&gt;<i> on deriving from 'Countable' and using ref_ptr ?
</I>
If it wasn't for heterogeneous AST support we'd be using one now, the
ones from wheatfarm.org (thanks to Mark Lentczner). Countable/ref_ptr
are not in the 2.7.5 release anymore. I could have release with
Countable/ref_ptr for the tokens/SharedInputStates and the old ones
for the AST's but it seemed better to me to release with just the old
'brand' and leave options open for after 2.7.5 release.

I will probably investigate getting rid of the reference counter for
the AST's and Tokens. This will give a good speed up and make the
heterogenous AST stuff less of a headache on the codegen front.

Cheers,

Ric

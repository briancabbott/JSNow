<PRE>Perhaps my emails are not getting through one way or another.

The scope goes in your tree walker.
The scope contains a tree node
Push a scope in the WITH rule
Add the expression node to the scope
Use the scope when you see a . reference, it will automatically be the
correct scope
Done.

You say:
&gt;<i> For that input, I want an AST like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ^(CALL foo.method1)
</I>&gt;<i> ^(ASSIGN x foo.bar.property)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No. You want:

^(CALL ^(DOT method1))
^(ASSIGN x ^(DOT ^(DOT bar property))

Then

with
scope
{
	CommonTreeNode withExpr;
}
:<i> ^(WITH e=expression { $with::withExpr = $e; } block)
</I>;

Then when you find a DOT node with just one child, you can reference the
expression to use via $with::withExpr

So, don't try to solve this with tree rewrites, just process it naturally
in the walker.

</I>&gt;<i> scope
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There's your problem..the enclosed block needs to be part of the
</I>&gt;<i> withStatement rule I would say (how else would you decide when the
</I>&gt;<i> object in the with statement goes out of scope?). Once you bring the
</I>&gt;<i> enclosed block into the rule, you will be able to reference the
</I>&gt;<i> enclosing withStatement rule scope.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not a problem, there is an End With statement to terminate the block
</I>&gt;<i> (but even if there wasn't, the end of the block would suffice). I
</I>&gt;<i> really didn't think this was relevant to the original question - there
</I>&gt;<i> are independent statements, including With and method calls (among
</I>&gt;<i> others), and I want to distribute the object of the With into the other
</I>&gt;<i> statements in its block. I provided the two rules as an example of the
</I>&gt;<i> producer and one consumer of the token, but that is by no means the
</I>&gt;<i> complete grammar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't seem practical to get the enclosed block into the
</I>&gt;<i> withStatement, since With and every other statement (there are many)
</I>&gt;<i> can be in the block, and you can nest With statements. This really
</I>&gt;<i> seems like a scope to me, so it is possible to get the reference into
</I>&gt;<i> the scope, and if so, what's the syntax, and what are the best
</I>&gt;<i> practices when doing so?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With foo
</I>&gt;<i>   .method1()
</I>&gt;<i>   With .bar
</I>&gt;<i>     x = .property
</I>&gt;<i>   End With
</I>&gt;<i> End with
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For that input, I want an AST like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ^(CALL foo.method1)
</I>&gt;<i> ^(ASSIGN x foo.bar.property)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, given that there are lots and lots of other statements that could
</I>&gt;<i> be in the With block, I think I really do want a scope rooted in the
</I>&gt;<i> With statement. I just need to know how to make it work. Specifically,
</I>&gt;<i> I cannot see how to get the With object token reference into the scope,
</I>&gt;<i> and how to retrieve it in the statements that can use it so that I can
</I>&gt;<i> construct the desired AST. Passing it as an argument would require
</I>&gt;<i> passing the argument to every single statement and expression rule,
</I>&gt;<i> which seems like a bad design, and seems to be what the scope was
</I>&gt;<i> designed to improve.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do I completely misunderstand the purpose of scopes? Are they not
</I>&gt;<i> intended to be used during AST construction?

<PRE>Bill,

Unless you have missed some of the grammar out from this post, it looks
to me like you don't actually have any rules in the grammar, only some
member functions? I would think that that you do really have some rules
but just have not posted them? ;-)

If I take out the java code from your post, we are left with:

// Test hoisting and use of predicates to allow us to use &quot;undelimited 
strings&quot;
grammar TestGrammar;

// I'm not using tokens in this langauge yet.
//tokens = { }


If this is really your grammar, then I would think it is pretty obvious
;-), that there is no rule for ANTLR to look for EOF in. 

Jim

Subject: [antlr-interest] Rookie attempt at ANTLR 3 (using the
currentANTLRWorks under Window XP)

Hi Folks:

I'm trying ANTLR 3 today, using ANTLRworks (so far it seems like Bovet
and 
Parr have some
reallly neat stuff in there).

I'm trying to compile the attached grammar in the tool and am getting a 
message:

Cannot generate the grammar because grammar TestGrammar : no start rule
(no 
rule can
obviously be followed by EOF).

This will probably out me to my coauthors and students, but I'm not a
big 
fan of the words
obviously/easily or their variants :-).

What does this message mean, how can I better convey to ANTLR that
startRule 
is the start rule?

Thanks:

Bill M.

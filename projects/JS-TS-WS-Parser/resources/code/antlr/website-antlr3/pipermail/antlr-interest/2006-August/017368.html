<PRE>Hi Denis,

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I have read on the antlr.org that ANTLR v3 is BSD
</I>&gt;<i> licensed. Does that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; mean that is incompatible to the GPL and therefore can't
</I>&gt;<i> be used with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; GPL'd applications? That would be a big drawback from
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR v2 for,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; probably, several apps.
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; Just out of interest, why? (as in why would this be a drawback?).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Given that alternative codegens and runtimes can be developed for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whatever targets one desires in ANTLR v3, I don't see how the ANTLR 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tool's license impacts on the use/licensing of any generated code 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and/or the [possibly custom] runtime library.
</I>
&gt;<i> The Problem is that the generated code still uses a runtime library, 
</I>&gt;<i> which means your app still is dependent on ANTLR. If ANTLR 3 was 
</I>&gt;<i> licensed under the &quot;original&quot; BSD license, this kind of dependence 
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't be allowed for a GPL'd program. ANTLR v2 had essentially a 
</I>&gt;<i> do-what-you-want-with-it license, so dependence on ANTLR v2 
</I>&gt;<i> is no issue 
</I>&gt;<i> for an app licensed under the GPL.
</I>
Thanks for the clarification. In a sense it simply confirms my earlier
statement.

GPL'ed applications can have binary dependencies. Ergo, many GPL'ed apps run
on (i.e. have a dependency on) Windows, OSX and/or Java for instance. That
being the case, the dependency of a GPL'ed application on the ANTLR v3
runtime library is a non-issue as one can always distribute the runtime
library binaries with the GPL'ed application. Most applications do not [and
should not] embed the ANTLR command-line tool.

AFAICT, the source licensing issue is only relevant if the intention is to
RE-LICENSE the ANTLR v3 sources (tool and runtime) under the GPL as was
common with the ANTLR v2 sources.

Were your comments essentially about allowing the re-licensing of ANTLR v3
sources under the GPL?

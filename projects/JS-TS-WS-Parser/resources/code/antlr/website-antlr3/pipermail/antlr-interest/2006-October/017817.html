Yes, I agree mine is a &quot;corner case&quot; - but I think it's the case that 
deserves
the name &quot;one source programming language to another source programming 
language translator&quot;.
and maybe even the shorthand &quot;language translator&quot;. I think most people 
using ANTLR
are doing stuff like you are, which is more &quot;parsing and generating 
source code&quot;.

The distinction because I think a lot of people mistakenly believe that 
tools like ANTLR and
ASTs will &quot;scale up&quot; from simple stuff to real, complete translation. I 
especially remember
the TXL documentation seeming to say basically &quot;here's how you replace a 
node in an AST,
and now you have what you need to translate one language to another&quot;. I 
was quite unhappy
to discover that I got almost nowhere with that approach. Now I think 
that's like saying
&quot;To convert English to Spanish, replace 'Hello' with 'Hola', but the 
adjectives after the nouns,
and so on&quot;. Meanwhile, people are spending their whole lives writing 
English to Spanish
translators, an the simple &quot;replace words with equivalents and put 
adjectives after nouns&quot;
got them about 0.00001% of the way there.

And yes, I do have to understand control flow, but not just that. I have 
to understand
that when the format string of printf() ends with '\n', it's replaced 
with println(), not print().
I have to be able to parse a printf() format string and know what 
&quot;%4.2d&quot; means. And lots
more.

I don't want people to get the wrong impression when they hear
&quot;look at how well this work for C- to Java&quot;
that the same technique will be reasonable for C to Java.

Andy
p.s. or the other way to look at it is &quot;I sure hope I haven't strayed 
down the wrong track
a long time ago, so I'll keep explaining what I did and why, and see if 
someone can tell me
where I went wrong&quot;.

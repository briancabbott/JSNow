<PRE>In preparation for maintaining our own maven repository, I have created
new artifacts for the ANTLR and StringTemplate releases and requested
that they be uploaded to Maven via:

<A HREF="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MAVENUPLOAD-2249">http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MAVENUPLOAD-2249</A>

If you are interested in this happening, please visit that JIRA report
and vote for it. I don't know how much that influences the upload but it
may well help to get someone to upload it quicker than otherwise.

If you have never heard of Maven, or only slightly, then if your
development is Java based (though it purports to work for other things),
I would suggest taking a look. Basically it replaces mountains of ANT
XML and knows how to download and use just about any components you can
think of, including ANTLR 2 and 3 thanks to the efforts of third party
developers. Well worth the day or so's effort of getting to know how it
works. 

Another side effect of using it is that there is a plugin for IDEs (at
least, Netbeans, IntelliJ/IDEA and eclipse) that means you can just open
the maven defined project and it knows what to do. This means the new
project definitions for ANTLR (released shortly) will mean you can build
ANTLR from source with ease.

However, all being well, we will soon have our own ANTLR repository for
Ter to deploy to, which will be auto synced to Maven and then as new
versions of ANTLR are released, they should automatically show up in
Maven.

One final note here is that there is of course no need to switch any of
your build procedures to Maven to use ANTLR - if you don't like it or
can;t be bothered with it, then just carry on with your current
procedure. The only side effect is that we will move the .g files around
in the ANTLR 3 source for 3.2 (details will be sent to the development
list once Ter is happy with it all), which is not really likely to
affect anyone (here is some advance notice of course ;-).

Share and Enjoy!

Jim

 &gt;Remember that not all the target languages have exceptions and

 &gt;are aware of this, and it is perhaps because the term exception
 &gt;implies that you can make your own algorithmic exceptions I 
guess.

As Loring said, this is a red herring because exceptions are 
already used for this purpose in both ANTLR 2 and 3.  I wouldn't 
do this with exceptions, though, since they *are* slow -- it's 
easy enough to write the equivalent rollback code without needing 
to use exceptions.

 &gt;Most people want/need efficient recognizers :-)

True, but it's counterproductive to program for efficiency by 
sacrificing correctness.

 &gt;Personally, as I can trivially express such a case in an
 &gt;ANTLR lexer, and the resulting code is more maintainable
 &gt;(because I do not have to imagine the implied interactions), I
 &gt;don't worry about it. It seems trite.

Ok, please show how you'd rewrite one of my other examples that 
doesn't work properly at the moment:

ONE: 'one';
TWO: 'two';
OTHER: .;

I don't see how you can get anything cleaner and more maintainable 
than that.

 &gt;and the way that ANLTR produces lexers is not down to some
 &gt;lack of knowledge on his part about other ways of constructing
 &gt;lexer generators, which I think most people would have to agree
 &gt;with.

I don't think anyone is saying that Ter has a lack of 
knowledge.  Just a blind spot in this particular case :)

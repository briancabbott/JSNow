&gt;<i> The questions raised about the warrantee/indemnity clause have caused

</I>&gt;<i> Well, actually, I believe that is a good thing.  The great strength of
</I>&gt;<i> the open source community are the contributors.  Not just in terms of the
</I>&gt;<i> nature and quality of the software they produce, but also of their
</I>&gt;<i> awareness of the larger business issues and willingness to discuss,

Indeed.

I pointed out the AFL specifically because it matches the warranties asked
for by the draft contributor &quot;license&quot; that Ter posted.


&gt;<i> With free software, it is almost by definition impossible to balance
</I>&gt;<i> economic risk.  Therefore, the one best place to prevent the contribution
</I>&gt;<i> of legally encumbered code is at the very outset.  Anyone not savvy or
</I>&gt;<i> experienced enough to understand the consequences of a particular
</I>&gt;<i> contribution should be cautioned to raise the appropriate questions prior
</I>&gt;<i> to making the contribution.  To that end, Terence's warrantee clause is
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate.
</I>
I understand your contention but I must disagree.  It seems quite
hypocritical to require a level of warranty from contributors that is not
the same as what is given to the users.

Thanks,
	John

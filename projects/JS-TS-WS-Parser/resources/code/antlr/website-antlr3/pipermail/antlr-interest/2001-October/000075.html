Don't forget that ANTLR uses my bitset very heavily during grammar 
analysis.  I recall that the java.util.BitSet didn't do inline stuff or 
something which concerned/irritated me (memory/GC considerations).

</I>
ANTLR can do much more to remove bitsets than it does.  It needs 
subrange -&gt; simple comparison convertion etc...  Now, it only works if 
the whole bitset is a range.  After that, a bitset tuned more for 
unicode would be useful, but we'd need to be careful that its degenerate 
case for ascii and my grammar analysis still move along fast enough.  
Simple hints like the offset you mention would be easy and work well.  
Fortunately, most of the time people reference ranges like &quot;valid 
identifier character&quot; that can be formally described a priori.  This 
prevents the lexer code generator from having to figure out an efficient 
bitset.  One might even have BitSet subclasses that efficiently 
implement a particular character set.

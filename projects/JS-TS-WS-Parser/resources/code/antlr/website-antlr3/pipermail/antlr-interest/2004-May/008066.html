</I>&gt;<i> a Lexer generator, a Parser generator and a TreeParser
</I>&gt;<i> generator and ANTLR provides them all.
</I>Yeah, hard enough to learn one tool really well.

&gt;<i> A significant

</I>&gt;<i> responses of similar questions that I had, or
</I>&gt;<i> responses to my questions which I received.
</I>I often forget that not every tool is open source and has a great 
support community.  Good points!

&gt;<i> Also, I
</I>&gt;<i> used for the project the Java lexer+parser distributed
</I>&gt;<i> with ANTLR as a start for the JavaScript equivalents.
</I>Everybody wants to start with something ready made.  I just did for a 
SQL parser contract a month ago.  Open source rocks.

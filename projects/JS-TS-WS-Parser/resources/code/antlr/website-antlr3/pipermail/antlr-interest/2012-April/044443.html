**********************************************************************

OVERVIEW/SCOPE
**************
The aim of  SCAM  is to bring  together researchers  and practitioners
working on theory, techniques and applications, which concern analysis
and/or manipulation of the source code of computer systems. While much
attention  in the wider  software engineering  community  is  properly
directed towards  other aspects of  systems  development and evolution,
such as  specification, design and requirements engineering, it is the
source code that contains the only precise description of the behavior
of the  system.  The  analysis and manipulation  of  source  code thus
remains a pressing concern.

COVERED TOPICS AND PAPER FORMATS
********************************
We welcome submission  of  *full papers*  that describe  original  and
significant work in the field of source code analysis and manipulation.
SCAM explicitly solicits results from any theoretical or technological
domain that can be applied to the following or similar topics:
- program transformation
- abstract interpretation
- program slicing
- source level software metrics
- decompilation
- source level testing and verification
- source level optimization
- program comprehension

SCAM  also welcomes *short tool papers* that introduce tools for source
code analysis and  manipulation. Tool papers should describe a concrete
source code analysis or manipulation tool that is available for download
and general use  and can  be  run and demonstrated  at  the conference.

Submitted papers should not be  longer than  10 pages (6 pages for tool
papers). All papers  submitted  should  follow  IEEE  Computer  Society
Press Proceedings Author Guidelines.  The  papers  should  be submitted
electronically in PDF form via the conference web site.Submitted papers
must not have  been previously  published or concurrently submitted for
consideration elsewhere.

In addition  to  the main  and  tool tracks,  SCAM 2012 solicits 2-page
*Frontiers position papers* describing a significantly new  idea in the
theory, technology, application or  engineering of source code analysis
and manipulation systems. Frontiers  authors will join in an open panel
discussion of the frontiers of the area at the conference.

IMPORTANT DATES

PROCEEDINGS
***********
All  accepted  papers  will appear  in  the  proceedings  which  will be
published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. Best papers from SCAM 2012
will be considered for revision, extension, and publication in a special
issue of the Journal of Software: Evolution and Process.

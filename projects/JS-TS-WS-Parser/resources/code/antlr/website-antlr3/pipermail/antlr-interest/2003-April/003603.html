<PRE>I guess I wasn't clear.  The lexer would both skip to the next statement and
throw an exception.  Then the parser would always be able to sync to the
SEMI.  The other errors have to be handled in the parser, but your first
post was (I think) about the lexer throwing two exceptions and you not able
to handle that. 

The filter rule is supposed to handle everything that the non-protected
rules don't.  I don't understand why you would want it non-protected.  Have
you read the antlr.org article about &quot;antlr meets SED?&quot;.  That covers the
rationale behind filter rules pretty well.

Note that you probably also want to specify the character set that you
expect to handle.  Otherwise antlr only uses characters you reference.  See
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/doc/options.html#charVocabulary">http://www.antlr.org/doc/options.html#charVocabulary</A>

Come back with more questions.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Re: exception thrown in syntatic predicate c
an't be caught!


It's tricky. A stmt could be invalid because there are (a) invalid 
characters; (b) it is syntactically invalid (eg wrong sequence of 
tokens), or (c) it is semantically invalid (eg things stmt refers to 
doesn't exist). If it's invalid for any reason I want to skip to the 
next stmt. Trouble is, if the lexer skips to the next stmt (ie 
semicolon), the parser won't see the trailing invalid tokens and 
there is a possibility the initial subset of valid tokens are 
syntactically and semantically valid (ie I will have silently 
truncated the stmt - not good).

The problem would be simplified if the filter=rule option didn't 
necessarily require the rule to be protected, that way I could always 
let the parser deal with invalid tokens. I'm basically coming round 
to the idea I need a lexer rule that captures everything that isn't 
lexacaly(?) valid (using the ~) and let the parser deal with these 
tokens which will not fit any rule and correctly signify a 
syntactcally invalid stmt.

Thanks for your help.
Martin

PS. I'm parsing user written stmts, so you never know what's coming 
down the pike.

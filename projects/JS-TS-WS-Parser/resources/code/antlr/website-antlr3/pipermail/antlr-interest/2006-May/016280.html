Well, people can subclass and change match if they want except that  
sets are matched inline without calling a method (because they are  
complicated beasts).  Those cannot be changed w/o ANTLR code  
generation changes.

Hm...well, people could do the following: come up with a char stream  
that yields uppercase to the lexer but stores the real char.  Then  
all char refs just have to be uppercase in the lexer and we're cool,  
right?  That way I don't have to mess with it...somebody can perhaps  
override a standard char stream.

I think Ric is thinking about this.

All error strings are in a template group now :)  People will be able  
to send in their language.stg files and errors will come out in the  
locale's strings. :)  All ST stuff allows char encoding ...

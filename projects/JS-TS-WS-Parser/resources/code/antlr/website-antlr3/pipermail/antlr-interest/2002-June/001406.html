<PRE>Hi,

I'm happy to see Monty's thread, because I am working on a preprocessing
tool that goes beyond the current grammar inheritance mechanism, using an
Aspect-like style of programming. For the moment, I am able to modify the
header and the main &quot;action&quot; (the additional Constructors, declarations and
methods) of a grammar. I'm still looking for a convenient syntax. I am
thinking on something like:

------------------------------------------------------------------

class MyXxxParser extends BasicXxxParser;

header { // new header
}

options { buildAST = true; }  // overwrite default value = false

{  // start of top-level inserted Java code

   ArrayList methodList;

   public MyXxxParser( Object arg) { ... }
}

------------------------------------------------------------------

If I want to preserve the original header, and just add something to it (a
new import, for instance, because I want to add some new auxiliary methods),
I can write something like:

...
header {
   super.header();           // preserve the default header
   import com.extra.*;       // add a new import
}

Alternatively, in an Aspect style:

XxxParser.header: last() { import com.extra.*;      // add a new import }

Of course, it will allow rule inheritance, like the current supergrammar
stuff, but it will also let you modify the init and final actions of the
rule.

Using Aspects, you can modify a group of related files. Let's say you want
to parse single line comments, looking for TODOs, FIXMEs or stuff like this.

aspect InterpretComments {

   //
   // Make the lexer switch to an embedded comment lexer, 
   // instead of returning a monolithic token
   //
   XxxLexer.COMMENT
      :  &quot;//&quot; { switchToCommentLexer(); }
      ;

   //
   // Add a rule in the parser to interpret the comments ...
   //
   XxxParser.comment
      :   COMMENT_START! (&quot;TODO&quot;^ | &quot;FIXME&quot;^ | ...) ...
      ;

   //
   // .. and new rules in the treeParser
   //
   XxxTreeParser.todo 
      :   #( &quot;TODO&quot; ... )
      ;
   XxxTreeParser.fixme
      :   #( &quot;FIXME&quot; ... )
      ;
}

Using Aspects can also bring the benefits of literate programming. For
instance, you can write the parser and treeParser rules interleaved in the
same Aspect, so that when you modify a parser rule, you have the
corresponding treeParser rule just bellow, being less tempted to say &quot;I'll
update it later&quot;.

I would like to go down to token (AST) level, and I'm thinking on a
XPath-like syntax:

/Parser/rules/&quot;expression&quot;/ID[3]

(to reffer the third ID of the parser rule named &quot;expression&quot;). Although I
would prefer '.' instead of '/' (more readable, to me).

I need to think more on this; what do you think? Any feedback from you will
help me a lot.

Best regards,
Bogdan

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh man...i think we're on to something.  AspectANTLR :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I like the separation of antlr phases concept.  When I was digging into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lookahead to generate a lookahead dependency graph I was frustrated by 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; caching of lookahead info.  I don't remember exactly now but it seems 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maybe I was trying to find the specific rules contributing to the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ambiguity
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but sometimes when I got to the ambiguous rule the lookahead was already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; computed without the backlinks to what rules contributed to the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lookahead
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; set.  Because you don't just want to know that a rule is ambiguous.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 50% of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the time it's because another rule called it and I was automating that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manual process of figuring out which caller rules were to blame.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, the cached lookahead information is useless for determining the 
</I>&gt;<i> paths in the grammar that are nondeterministic.  I would really like to 
</I>&gt;<i> have ANTLREclipse or whatever be able to highlight the paths for you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The caching is absolutely necessary for efficiency of this algorithm.  
</I>&gt;<i> Without it I cannot claim it is O(nk) where n is size of grammar.  But, 
</I>&gt;<i> a new version of antlr could avoid the caching when finding the problem 
</I>&gt;<i> spots.

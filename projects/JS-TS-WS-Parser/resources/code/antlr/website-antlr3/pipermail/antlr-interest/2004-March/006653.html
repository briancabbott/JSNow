<PRE>Hi,

I trust you mean lex or flex?

No. And it's not advisable to do so unless you really really really really
know what you're doing. You'll very likely to break the use of syntactic
predicates (if you use them). Line/column counting might also be broken.
I'm not saying it might not be possible to do though but it would require
some serious debugging/testing, I would not be surprised if it might be
impossible in some cases. It really sounds like you want to use syntactic
predicates (e.g. guessing mode).

In the case you want to control this unputting of characters from the
parser I can again not recommend this unless you really really .. etc. ;)

Using predicates might give you a more elegant solution. But if you feel
adventurous ;)

Cheers,

<PRE>I am using ANTLR3.1 for developing a SQL parser

One of my main rule looks like this

sql_statement:
    sql_statement_command (';')?

But when generating parser codes from grammar file to C source, it always take a very long time and consume as much as 5G memory because of the optional semicolon
Then in order to make the development easier, I make the semicolon a mandatory by removing the question mark, like this

sql_statement:
    sql_statement_command ';'

It does make the building faster and require much less memory.

But the problem now is, when parsing a statement without the semicolon, such as the following

select * from tt

ANTLR won't handle this but issue a signal 11
His is the stack information when this happening, when all test has been matched and is going to match the last semicolon

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0xb7370a09 in getMissingSymbol () from /home/oracle/install/lib/libantlr3c.so
(gdb) where
#0  0xb7370a09 in getMissingSymbol ()
   from /home/oracle/install/lib/libantlr3c.so
#1  0xb73701d0 in recoverFromMismatchedToken ()
   from /home/oracle/install/lib/libantlr3c.so
#2  0xb736f7bb in match () from /home/oracle/install/lib/libantlr3c.so

In my opinion, ANTLR should initialize an exception that can be processed by his own way, not issue this signal
Anyone has any ideas of suggestions on this?
Thanks a lot

You are already crazy like me ;) &lt;snicker, snort&gt;.  Just got mail from 
him. :)  Hope it's ok to repeat part here:

&gt;<i> - Packrat parsing guarantees linear-time parsing on all the types of 
</I>&gt;<i> grammars
</I>&gt;<i> it supports, which amounts to everything that fits the formalism or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;conceptual model&quot; of parsing expression grammars.  But the &quot;pure&quot; PEG 
</I>&gt;<i> model
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't directly support &quot;stateful&quot; grammars like those of C and C++, 
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> which you have to build up symbol tables and such that effectively 
</I>&gt;<i> modify the
</I>&gt;<i> grammar mid-stream as the parser scans the input from left to right.  
</I>&gt;<i> From
</I>&gt;<i> what I've seen so far, it appears fundamentally difficult or 
</I>&gt;<i> impossible to
</I>&gt;<i> make a packrat parser support stateful grammars efficiently without
</I>&gt;<i> effectively turning it into a deterministic (e.g., LR) parser.
</I>
So, the actions are the problem for everyone :)

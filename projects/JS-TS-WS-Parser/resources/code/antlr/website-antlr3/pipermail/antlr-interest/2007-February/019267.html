<PRE>As an ANTLR newbie ;-), I've run into this exact problem myself.

Personally, I think keystrokes are (relatively) cheap, so making the user be
explicit about where things go isn't a bad way to do it, even if it means
having @parser::members and @lexer::members too. Having the &quot;anonymous&quot;
@header automatically map to one or the other (parser, in the current form)
seems counter-intuitive, while only having the explicit specifications gives
the system a more &quot;symmetric&quot; feel. If there's an inconsistency, as
mentioned by Dr. Parr, then we should make the system consistent, all the
way, as much as possible.

As Mr. Probst put it, it's definitely a newbie trap. While it's easy (and
certainly true) to just respond with a &quot;Read The Fine Manual,&quot; I'm in
agreement with one of my undergrad professors, Dr. Daniel Cooke: programming
languages should be adapted to people, not the other way around
(paraphrase).

Changing to use @parser::header and @parser::members doesn't require a
change in the language semantics. Both the parser and lexer have a header,
and both have members. Requiring @parser::header simply makes it explicit
which you mean, and eliminates a point of ambiguity, especially for people
who are just starting out with the system.

Thanks,
~Brian DeVries

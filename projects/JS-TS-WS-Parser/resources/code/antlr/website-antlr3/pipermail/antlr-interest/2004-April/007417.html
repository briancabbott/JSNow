<PRE>I asked this question back in October of 2000 and never got an answer. 
I've worked on it on and off (mostly off) since then and have not come
up with an answer.  I've updated to antlr 2.7.3 hoping that it'd be
better at this, but still haven't gotten it working.  

So here's the question again to see if anyone else can figure it out.

The structure of the file is as follows:

compilationUnit
  :
(javadocComment)*
(package)?
(javadocComment | import)*
( (invariantCondition)* typeDefinition)*
EOF

/**
   This is a javadoc comment that we're not looking for any conditions
in.
**/
javadocComment
  : JAVADOC_OPEN ( INVARIANT_CONDITION | PRE_CONDITION | POST_CONDITION
|<i> ASSERT_CONDITION )* JAVADOC_CLOSE
</I>  ;

/**
   This is a javadoc comment that we're looking for invariants in.
**/
invariantCondition
  : JAVADOC_OPEN ( iv:INVARIANT_CONDITION { addInvariant(iv); } |
PRE_CONDITION | POST_CONDITION | ASSERT_CONDITION )* JAVADOC_CLOSE
  ;

Basically it's a Java grammar, where the javadoc comments are
important.  I've gotten past the lexer by using two lexers, one for
inside comments and one for everything else.  That gives me a nice token
stream, but I just can't seem to get past the top rule above.  If I
don't allow comments anywhere above typeDefinition and require that
typeDefiniation exists, it'll compile and go.  However I want to allow
comments above typeDefinition and I want to allow a file that's
commented out with single line comments (thus no type definition).

Thanks for any help you can provide.

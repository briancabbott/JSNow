<PRE>No problem - I find it difficult to get too worked up about it. Now, that example would be great if people would take the time to search past posts before they posed a question here ;-)

Dear Jim, I like your sense of humour! You'll probably be annoyed that I already took the time read the book before I checked my email for your message because I didn't think anyone would reply. I wasn't asking anybody to read the manual, just if someone knew it off-hand. It would have saved me time 3 days ago but I guess my reading the book is now knowledge for the &quot;bank&quot;. Still I think and hope somebody new to language translation will be helped by your simple example. Truly grateful, N

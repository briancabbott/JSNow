 &gt;I have a language consisting of source code and comments. I have 
a
 &gt;lexer and parser that create an AST of it. I would like to use 
the

of
 &gt;them will need access to the comments, some of them won't. I
 &gt;cannot just ignore the comments, but I also don't want to store
 &gt;all of them inside the AST. Instead, inside the lexer I 
recognize
 &gt;comments, copy them (current value of self.text) into a separate 

 &gt;table and replace the comment's text by overwriting self.text 
with
 &gt;an index referencing the comment's table entry.

Isn't that what channels are for?

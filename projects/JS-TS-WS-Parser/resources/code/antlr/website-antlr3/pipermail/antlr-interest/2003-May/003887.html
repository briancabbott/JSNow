<PRE>I create a newline token called EOL, and then when my parser constructs
its tree it doesn't bother putting it in the tree. Would that work?

Or maybe a parser rule that recognises and dumps EOL.

Cheers,
Wol

Subject: [antlr-interest] Continuing problem with # directives


Ok, so now I have a solution for detecting '#' as the start of a 
directive in C. Now I wrote the following grammar rule for the parser:

hash_directive 
    : 
    HASH_DIRECTIVE_BEGIN
    &quot;include&quot;  
    (
        STRING
        | LESS ( ~GREATER )+ GREATER
    )
    ;

This will nicely match #include &quot;a&quot; or #include &lt;iostream&gt;. Cool. But 
now I need to enforce that the directive ends with some trailing 
spaces and a newline. Otherwise, my parser will consider the following 
construct legal:

#include &quot;a&quot; void foo() {}

But the problem is, my NEWLINE rule sets the token type to SKIP, so I 
can't detect it in the parser. Any good solution for that? Thanks!

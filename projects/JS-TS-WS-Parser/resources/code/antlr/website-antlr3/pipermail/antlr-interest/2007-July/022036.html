<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Ter can do no wrong, eh? Fanboys... sheesh...
</I>
Resorting to Ad Honimem isn't particularly helpful.

&gt;<i> Quite simply, I am saying the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * I am _not_, nor did I, &quot;demand&quot; anything
</I>&gt;<i> * The basic docs of the tool are not free
</I>
They are. What with the wiki, the list archives, the website (particularly
Ter's v3 dev blogs spanning a couple of years), the copious source
comments....

&gt;<i> * The tool isn't completely usable without the book
</I>
There are a number of posts to the list (that *predate* this thread) by
users forging ahead without the book.

&gt;<i> * Therefore, claiming ANTLR is open source is wrong
</I>
Only problem is that ANTLR v3 *is* open source. The source is available
under a very permissive license as you know.

&gt;<i> At the point I was writing the eclipse plugin for v3, I 
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't find the info I needed for a few things anywhere 
</I>&gt;<i> *but* the book.
</I>
What information in particular?. I'm genuinely interested as I may encounter
the same issues as you have.

&gt;<i> I didn't mind supporting Ter's work, so I bought the book.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I saw this thread and decided to add my 2c, in a very civil 
</I>&gt;<i> manner. Ter jumped all over my ass, and the fanboys are 
</I>&gt;<i> spinning like crazy.
</I>
I agree that some of the exchanges have been somewhat personal....and that's
a shame. I've found using ANTLR to be a much more civilized affair than
hacking with Lex/Yacc-style tools.

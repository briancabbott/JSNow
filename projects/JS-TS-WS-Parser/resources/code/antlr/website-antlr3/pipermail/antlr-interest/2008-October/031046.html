</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is your Doxygen config file available??

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Yes, of course I have the source code. How else could I generate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the JavaDoc HTML??
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; etc. Always look here before posting, you can save a lot of time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; for everyone.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Jeez. If I knew what to look for I wouldn't have to ask.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Err, taking issue with me telling you where the source code tree
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; browser is (and giving you the links to the doxygen config file)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Though in fact you did not give me &quot;... the links to the doxygen config 
</I>&gt;<i> file,&quot; only a pointer to the large set of files in which it might be 
</I>&gt;<i> found. And you did this even though it was clear from my earlier 
</I>&gt;<i> postings in this thread that I had the source code already. You 
</I>&gt;<i> could &quot;... save a lot of time for everyone ...&quot; by paying attention to 
</I>&gt;<i> the threads to which you're posting.
</I>

Unreal, you  take issue that I give you a link to a list of files at the
top level runtime directory, which in the case of Java consists of a
list of 1 file, which is called 'doxyfile'. Obviously you didn't
actually bother to click on the link, but just decided to assume it was
a list of all the source code.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is a bit rich don't you think? How could you NOT know what to look
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for if you know how to run doxygen?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Doxygen makes no demands on the name of the config file, so one really 
</I>&gt;<i> has nothing to go on a priori in seeking it within a source 
</I>&gt;<i> distribution of, as is the case with ANTLR 3.1.1, 89 directories and 
</I>&gt;<i> 802 files.
</I>

Oh yeah, because everyone calls the config file zarquon and never places
it at the top of the directory tree.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Don't worry though, I won't make the mistake of offending you again by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trying to help. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By using the word &quot;jeez&quot; to express mild exasperation you conclude I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> offended?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nonetheless, I feel I will survive without your insights. 
</I>

But you won't get very far without the insights given to you on this
group it seems, given that you post about 5 times as many questions as
anyone else. You might want to turn down the levels on your righteous
indignation buttons.


&gt;<i> You may feel 
</I>&gt;<i> free to put me in your killfile. I will sleep soundly even if you do.
</I>

I have no doubt that you will, but I have no time for this nonsense.

Jim

<PRE>&gt;<i> What about a Main_Parser with a larger lookahead or syntactic predicates
</I>&gt;<i> which makes the Main_Lexer consume characters which were intended for B_Lexer?
</I>
Seems to work OK, ANTLR behave well.
The Main_lexer may look ahead, but rewind before passing control to sub_lexer.
There are overlap of token between lexers that does not matter.

The tricky stuff with exceptions did not proof to be a good solution : cancel it.
I am still looking for a way to return from a sub_lexer matching an optionnal end token.

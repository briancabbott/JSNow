Either I missed it, or my memory is failing me. Probably both ;)

There are not many cases where you really want to get a parse tree  
(Yes, I know there are some, but it's not the general case).

&gt;<i> I still think that there needs to be an easy way to obtain a parse

Well, there is support for generating parse trees, right? I can't  
remember what the class is called, and I think it uses the debug  
interface to get the rule invocations (most likely turns those into  
some kind of token, I guess, without looking the code) and then builds  
a tree.
I'm pretty sure there's even a wiki page on how to do it.
Wow, even google knows how to do it: <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?q=antlr+v3+generate+parse+tree">http://www.google.com/search?q=antlr+v3+generate+parse+tree</A> 
  (second hit for me) ;)
This is the wiki page that it links to <A HREF="http://antlr.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1760">http://antlr.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1760</A>

cheers,

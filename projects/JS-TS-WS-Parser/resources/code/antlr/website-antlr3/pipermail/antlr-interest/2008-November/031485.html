<PRE>I was looking at writing a Maven plugin around gUnit tonight, and I ran 
into two issues that I was hoping could be addressed.

My approach was to use the JUnitCodeGen class to generate JUnit classes 
during maven's generate-test-sources phase. 


The first issue that I ran into was that I was unable to specify the 
output directory.  I was able to get around this by extending 
JUnitCodeGen and overriding &quot;writeTestFile&quot;, but this seems a bit 
hackish, as I had to throw away the &quot;dir&quot; parameter to this method  
(which is hard coded as &quot;.&quot;).  Something like a &quot;setOutputDirectory&quot; 
that was then used in the call to writeTestFile would be much more 
elegant here.

The second issue was in the constructor, where it invokes 
&quot;Class.forName(...)&quot;.  When I'm invoking this from maven, my generated 
parser classes likely aren't in the system ClassLoader.  However, I am 
able to load them all into a child ClassLoader, so it would be great if 
there were a way to provide a ClassLoader to JUnitCodeGen so that it can 
load the parser class from there instead.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able 
to work around this one without modifying JUnitCodeGen.

Is this the preferred way to access GUnit programmatically?  I'm open 
for suggestions.

Thanks,
Jared

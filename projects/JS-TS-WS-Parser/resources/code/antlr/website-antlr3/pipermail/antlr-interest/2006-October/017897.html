</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I realize that. I'm just saying that I wouldn't consider my library of 
functions on token-streams to
be &quot;implementing a recursive descent parser by hand&quot; as you said. Not 
even close.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Yes, I suppose. But even with C and C++, what seems simple may not be. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>For example, you'd think that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>struct person p[100];
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>might correspond to a single line of Java, but it doesn't (you need to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>initialize the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>array). So suddenly, out of nowhere, you may have to add a static block 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>of code. That's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>a typical one-to-many type of thing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'm not sure how an AST a la antlr prevents you from doing this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'm not saying using an AST prevents you from doing this, just that it's 
not helping. I've found that
for over 99% of what I'm doing, an AST is not helping. Therefore, I 
don't have an AST-centric
architecture.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>because it may certainly have changed since you last looked at it..in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>other words, the symbol
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>table can be a mess to maintain. In my case, the return type of b() may 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>have change, the name of it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>may have changed, its argument types may have changed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Changed from what to what? And how the heck can they change in a single
</I>&gt;<i>run of the compiler? I'm confused.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It's not a compiler, it's a translator! &quot;if (1)&quot; works in C, but not 
Java. So when we have
&quot;if (a)&quot; and &quot;a&quot; is type &quot;int&quot;, we need to change its type to boolean. 
(And no, I'm not just going
to change it to &quot;if (a != 0)&quot;  ).

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Also, my tool does not have to be fast - if it takes an hour to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>translate some code, when it could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>have taken 2 seconds if I had designed it &quot;right&quot;, that's ok.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I don't think anyone is telling you that you didn't design it right! I
</I>&gt;<i>myself would like to have the power of:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>v1 = v1 + v2 =&gt; v1 += v2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>transformations. Myself, I'm only trying to figure out what the big deal
</I>&gt;<i>is that prevents you from using antlr. Personally, I know I wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i>want to write token matching code.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Nothing preventing me from using ANTLR. Just saying that I've found that 
walking an AST is
not the best architecture for what I'm doing. I use ANTLR for lexing, 
and even for AST generation
for expressions. It's just that my translator is not in any way &quot;a 
treewalker&quot; approach, either using
ANTLR treewalkers or just a Visitor pattern.

&gt;<i>Please don't think I am attacking your translator. We all know how
</I>&gt;<i>difficult the problem is you're trying to solve. All I'm trying to
</I>&gt;<i>understand is how you solved it.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No problem. I have thick skin :)

I feel like I'm always &quot;talking past&quot; people on this list, and I think 
it's the &quot;compiler mindset&quot;.
I really do think that C-to-Java and COBOL-to-Java, where you produce 
&quot;natural&quot; Java code,
is more like English-to-Spanish than it is like Java-to-bytecode. Sure, 
the input and output
are structured and treelike, but to emulate what a person does, simply 
&quot;walking the tree&quot;
isn't going to work for English-to-Spanish or COBOL-to-Java. Go ahead 
and and put
&quot;Woods Eyes Masters&quot; into a tree and then convert to Spanish. You'll 
come back later
and say &quot;...but my program would have to know the context to even see 
that it's talking
about Tiger!&quot; and I'll grin and say &quot;that's right.&quot;

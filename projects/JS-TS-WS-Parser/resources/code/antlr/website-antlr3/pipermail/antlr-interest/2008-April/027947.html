<PRE>&gt;<i>  &gt;I agree that it looks 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;silly, but the point of the 'addressable' is that you can start
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;with a variable or argument, and use methods and attributes of
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;this variable or argument to chain them together (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;myarg.SomeGetMethod().AnotherMethod().GetAttribute()) so yes, an
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;Identifier by itself is a valid addressable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you may have missed my point.  You've said that an 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;addressable&quot; by itself is a valid statement.  Obviously a method 
</I>&gt;<i> call is a valid statement.  But is an object or field reference a 
</I>&gt;<i> valid statement?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You're right: I did miss your point. Unfortunately this is not a new language, and I didn't create it... So yes, an addressable by itself is a valid statement. :-(
 
&gt;<i> (Of course, I also strongly dislike single-exit-point languages; 
</I>&gt;<i> they can lead to excessive nesting and temporary variable 
</I>&gt;<i> shenanigans, especially when simply trying to assert 
</I>&gt;<i> preconditions.  But hey, whatever makes you happy.) :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I completely agree. It does however make a *huge* difference in implementation complexity in our case since we have a propagator that uses parse-time (meta) information to determine which code needs to be executed whenever a value changes. (It's a mixed functional/procedural language)

Thanks again,

Ramon

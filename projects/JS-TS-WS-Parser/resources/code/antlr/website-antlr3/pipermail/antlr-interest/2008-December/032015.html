<PRE>I need to extract C++ objects from tree that will result from C runtime.

Would anyone mind sharing examples of walking the AST information extracted
by the C runtime?  I'm just looking for something to give me a jumpstart.

I have the grammar/lexicon working just fine in Java.  I don't know if it
has value or not, but I'm attaching the ANTLR .g file.

The examples that Jim so kindly put together for the C runtime don't appear
to apply to my case in that I do not need to verify the language - I'm
parsing code that is extracted from another IDE that has already verified
the text as being compliant against the ENBF rules.  What I need to do is
determine which rules apply for a particular sequence of text, and extract
different C++ objects depending upon which ENBF rules were fired.  Hence
what I need is more like a parse tree than an AST tree.

In the early summer/late spring someone was kind enough to provide such an
example, but Outlook ate my archival files and I was unable to recover it
(yes teacher, the dog really did eat my homework).

And, as always, it would be really nice to know when the promised C++
version of the C runtime will be made available to see if the C++ version
helps simplify things.

Thanks so much for the assistance,

Regards,

George

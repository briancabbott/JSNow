I think you'll find antlr would be great for this job.  Pretty much
all of the hard work has already been done for you.  There is a java
lexer/parser and AST recogniser on the antlr web site.

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/grammar/1090713067533/index.html">http://www.antlr.org/grammar/1090713067533/index.html</A>

Use the lexer/parser to read in your Java source code into an AST. 
Then modify the AST recogniser to output the documentation you need.

I think you would add your documentation action to the method call in
primaryExpression.  There will probably be a couple of lines of fiddly
code to extract the string from the AST.

Goodluck,
David.

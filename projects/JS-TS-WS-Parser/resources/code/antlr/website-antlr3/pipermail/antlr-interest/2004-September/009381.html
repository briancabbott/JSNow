<PRE>Hi Folks,

I've just started to use ANTLR, and seem to be in the minority because I
have C++ as my target language, rather than java.  I've been able to compile
an executable with my language it in (hurrah!), but am having a hard time
sorting out what is Java and what is ANTLR in a specific file.

Is there a place where someone that knows compilers well (theory and
application) can find information on what is available in the actions and
surrounding code for a C++ target?   The LL(k) versus LALR stuff wasn't much
of a problem - though lexing REAL versus INTEGER is annoying - but figuring
out the class hierarchy and what magic incantation to use to get what I want
seems to be hard.

For example, I know that C++ uses &quot;-&gt;&quot; in most(?) places where the Java uses
&quot;.&quot;; likewise, &quot;::&quot; instead of &quot;.&quot; seemed to resolve some other problems.
Now I'm at one that stumped me.  In the &quot;Debugging and Testing Grammars&quot;
discussion on the web, there are several calls to &quot;super.&lt;xxyyzz&gt;&quot;; however,
I don't know the name of the superclass to use when translating this to C++,
so can't precisely implement this on my own.


Thank you,

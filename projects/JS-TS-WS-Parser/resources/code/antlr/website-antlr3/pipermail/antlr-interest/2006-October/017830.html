</I>
Yes. Sorry. My mistake. I shouldn't have said the treewalker way would
be a mess, just
that I don't think it's helping. So the treewalk approach looks
something like:

void doTheCheck() {
// here I am at the conditional node of an &quot;if&quot;, &quot;while&quot;, or &quot;for&quot;
if (symbolTable.getType(varName) != &quot;boolean&quot;) {
   boolean canBeChanged = true;
   for (Use use: UseDefChains.getAllUsagesOf(varName)) {
         if (!use.canBeChangedToBoolean()) {
             canBeChanged = false;
        }
    }
   if (canBeChanged) {
      SymbolTable.changeType(varName, &quot;boolean&quot;);
      for (Use use: UseDefChains.getAllUsagesOf(varName)) {
           use.change();
     }
   }
}
}

The thing is, you'll need to write this code whether you're doing
treewalking or &quot;token-stream-matching&quot;.
All the treewalking does for you is to have this code kick-in in the
right place. And that's just as easy to
do with &quot;token-stream-matching&quot;. In my case, it looks something like:

public boolean match(Source source) {
    if (source.currentToken.getText().equals(&quot;if&quot;) ||
source.currentToken.getText().equals(&quot;while&quot;)) {
       doTheCheck(source.getTokenAt(+2));
  } else if (source.currentToken.getText().equals(&quot;for&quot;)) {
       Token semi = source.findToken(&quot;;&quot;);
       doTheCheck(source.getTokenAt(semi, +1));
  }
}


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> My main point is that it's ok to have multiple tree structures, L  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and  L', but the union and/or slow morphing of one to the other is  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a total  pain I've found.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, it's a royal pain, but if you start with the requirement that  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you will produce &quot;natural&quot; code, there's no choice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Well, I suppose anything is possible, it's just a matter of how  
</I>&gt;<i> convenient.  And you are saying it's inconvenient really not impossible.
</I>

Right. I found I just couldn't get cranking on writing transformation
&quot;rules&quot; because I was spending all my time
trying to picture AST mappings in my head. Spending all my time on &quot;how&quot;
to do it, not &quot;what&quot; do to.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think just this simple example that I brought up before actually  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> brings the problem to the surface:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> String hello = &quot;hello&quot;;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> String world = &quot;world&quot;;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> printf(&quot;%s %s\n&quot;, hello, world);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...becomes...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> System.out.println(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can't see how that can be done by treewalking. By the time the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code is actually written to implement &quot;printf to System.out.println&quot;,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there will be almost no &quot;tree-transformation&quot; or even &quot;tree  walking&quot; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> logic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   The logic is identifying that you have entered a list of  statements 
</I>&gt;<i> and you see a print statement.  The translation logic is a  simple 
</I>&gt;<i> one-to-one mapping from printf to println just as you would do  in a 
</I>&gt;<i> rule right?  
</I>
It may map to println() or print(), and I don't recall whether I
actually may combine several printf() calls into a single println() call,
but that's certainly the type of thing that I do.

&gt;<i> The only problem is discovering what should be the  expression.  
</I>&gt;<i> Either in a previous phase I would have done constant  propagation or 
</I>&gt;<i> in your case you ask the question or something in one  of your 
</I>&gt;<i> declaration rules.  Do you insert actions in your rules to go  check 
</I>&gt;<i> data structures?  Surely you don't write a rule that has a   
</I>&gt;<i> context-sensitive pattern  asking if there have been all possible  
</I>&gt;<i> variable declarations before the print, right?
</I>
Right, I just &quot;write code&quot; to go ahead and parse the format string,
match it up with the printf() arguments, and replace it
all with a single &quot;+&quot;-separated Java expression.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As for the try/catch, all the work is in finding a good &quot;level&quot; to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> insert the try/catch. For example, if we have three consecutive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> read() calls, best to put them into a single try/catch. If we need  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to catch both FileNotFoundException and IOException
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for one statement, and just IOException for the following  statement, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what do we do?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  how do you handle that?  I very is to to learn more about your  
</I>&gt;<i> approach; I see you talking about how the tree walking won't work,  
</I>&gt;<i> but I don't see how yours will work.  It is very interesting and I  
</I>&gt;<i> want to learn more.
</I>
I just decide what the most &quot;natural&quot; thing to do is, and then &quot;just
write code&quot; to do it. I can't remember exactly how I
do it for exceptions, but I'd do something like &quot;If two consecutive
calls throw exactly the same set of exceptions, put
them both in the same try block, otherwise, each call is in its own try
block&quot;. Then, if that produces fairly ugly code in
lots of cases, I might make it more complicated.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for your patience - guess I'm a natural contrarian :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Always good for an excellent discussion and to shake things up...

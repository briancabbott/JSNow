I already have something in Antlr Studio somewhere alogn the lines of
what you are saying.
Look at the vide of lexer wizard. It is entirely based on that idea
that almost all languages have single and multi lien comments,
identifiers of a common type ,and string literals.
You just have to specify the delimeters and token names for these in
the wizard and the lexer is created for you.

Thus a lexer which would usually take hours and be riddled with bugs,
can be built in under a minute.

&gt;<i> The ideea is to catch all these patterns in procedural
</I>&gt;<i> languages and to make something to start upon...

</I>&gt;<i> I didn't read the other replies on this topic and if I
</I>&gt;<i> had the same idea as anyone else, but later, I do
</I>&gt;<i> appologise for repeating...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I don't claim this ideea :))

<PRE>Two comments about licencing ...

Why not look at one of the biggest Open Source projects out there?
namely linux &lt;vbg/&gt;

And what's wrong with the *L*GPL? I can't tell Ter what to do with his
stuff, but as a small-time programmer, it would be my licence of choice.
And I don't see why my employers can't take advantage of it if they
wish.

Cheers,
Wol

Here are a few:

0) (I thought of this last but I'm adding it at the beginning because
it's so important to me!).  Those of us wanting to use Antlr within a
corporate environment have to do something to make the laywers happy.
 I think the singlemost important thing you can do here is to have a
mechanism for registering contributers.  Each contributer should be
reachable (email is fine but the more contact info you have the
better) and should have made some kind of affirmation that they agree
with the license (this affirmation could be an email that you print
and save, but a signed form faxed or snail-mailed would be even better).

I suggest looking at some of the bigger open source projects like
Mozilla or Eclipse or Apache to see what mechanisms and forms they use.

Laywers would be even happier if the contributers all assign their
copyrights to one person (i.e. Terence) or entity (like U of S.F.) but
I don't think this is necessary as long as all of the contributers are
contactable (and there aren't so many that it becomes extremely
difficult to contact them all).

Beyond that, you mentioned before that you are considering BSD as the
license.  That would work for me.  GPL or LGPL would totally disallow
me from using Antlr.  CPL (the license Eclipse uses) would be ideal
for me but BSD is very doable.

One of the thoughts we had in the cabal was that you would specify the 
token attributes in an ANTLR formalism and the code generator would be 
able to decide how to encode in the target language.  For example, you 
might do

token {
   // text and type predefined perhaps
   int start;
   int stop;
   String filename;
}

At NeXT I had to encode token type and line number into a 32 bit int, 
but in other cases it had to be an object.  The code generator could 
generate either depending on options and what attributes you had in 
there.

Just some thoughts we had.  We're thinking about language independence 
pretty heavily since I expect to make building a code generator for 
ANTLR pretty easy.  Lots of back ends will appear I hope.  I'm going to 
go so far as to have a text-based intermediate form (if wanted) so that 
you don't even have to build the code generator in ANTLR.  You could 
build the python code generator in python for example as it's just 
reading a text file with all the &quot;hard parts&quot; filled in :)

<PRE>   Thank you all for the tips.

   We will look into following your suggestions!

    Cheers,

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, CL is definitely the way to go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, with Lisp, the easy stuff is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> expression =
</I>&gt;<i>   '(' expression* ('.' expression)? ')'
</I>&gt;<i>   | symbol
</I>&gt;<i>   | number
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> which is more or less the whole &quot;natural&quot; syntax of Lisp - it was designed
</I>&gt;<i> to be trivial parse on 1950s hardware!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The language Lisp then uses &quot;special forms&quot; which define the semantics.
</I>&gt;<i> These include examples like (if (= a b) (print c)), where &quot;if&quot; the
</I>&gt;<i> conditional. However, special forms are not syntactic, really.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, you very quickly get into additional stuff which is done by
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;readtables&quot;, which define associations between characters, and which can
</I>&gt;<i> strictly (in Common Lisp) be manipulated at run-time, or even at compile
</I>&gt;<i> time. These extensions are mostly simple, but a few (such as backquote)
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> not. Essentially, you can associate a character with a function then then
</I>&gt;<i> gets called as part of the reader, which is what takes text and turns it
</I>&gt;<i> into a Lisp internal representation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In ANTLR terms, these character associations can recursively call the
</I>&gt;<i> parser
</I>&gt;<i> (or even the raw input stream) to do other stuff. Comments, for example,
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i> be handled by the read-table, both the regular &quot;;&quot; and the balanced &quot;#|
</I>&gt;<i> ....
</I>&gt;<i> |#&quot; type.  &quot;#&quot; is an extension to the read-table for all sorts of nasty
</I>&gt;<i> stuff, and uses the second character to invoke a function (i.e.,
</I>&gt;<i> readtables
</I>&gt;<i> can be cascaded). For example, &quot;#'&quot; is a readtable macro that reads a Lisp
</I>&gt;<i> expression (as above) and conveniently wraps the (FUNCTION ...) special
</I>&gt;<i> form
</I>&gt;<i> around it, just as &quot;'&quot; is a convenience for (QUOTE ...). ANTLR can do all
</I>&gt;<i> this stuff nicely with ASTs, if you put all these characters in the lexer,
</I>&gt;<i> and then match them at the left of the expression rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i.e., pick a subset of CL, or another Lisp, and when you have it, the
</I>&gt;<i> grammar will probably be trivial. Don't even think about trying to do all
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> CL in ANTLR (or any other parser) - it was designed in a way that allows
</I>&gt;<i> Lisp to take control of the input process at certain stages; ideal for
</I>&gt;<i> higher-level language processing. You probably don't need some of the
</I>&gt;<i> oddities of CL, like some of the rarer # readtable macros, not that they
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> hard to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is the issue with Lisp - there is a standard, but it would be
</I>&gt;<i> inappropriate to implement much of it in ANTLR as it is largely dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> intimately connected with the core language; yet subsets may vary
</I>&gt;<i> depending
</I>&gt;<i> on context of use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the best
</I>&gt;<i> Stuart

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     All,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    We need a Lisp ANTLR3 grammar for the Drools open source project
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (<A HREF="http://labs.jboss.com/drools/">http://labs.jboss.com/drools/</A>). We were going to build one from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scratch, but I was wondering if anyone has one ready and can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contribute to the project. All proper credits would be given, as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; usual. Project's license is ASF.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    Alternatively, an (E)BNF Lisp grammar that we can use as a base to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; build an ANTLR3 would also be helpful. Our main worry is how to define
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the function name token for Lisp, since lisp accepts almost anything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as a function name.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, you could make it really easy for yourself and make a lisp
</I>&gt;<i> that doesn't take everything as a function name. The easiest you could
</I>&gt;<i> do is probably just use the CL conventions and parse everything as
</I>&gt;<i> atoms, separated by spaces. Spaces in atom names can be escaped with \.
</I>&gt;<i> You can also have an atom name inside bars: |foo bar|, and then strings.
</I>&gt;<i> That's really all you need.

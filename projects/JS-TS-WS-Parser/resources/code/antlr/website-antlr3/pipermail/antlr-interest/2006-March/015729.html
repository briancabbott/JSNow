<PRE>Having the tests generated from the grammar seems like a bad thing,
from a project point of view.  Perhaps for the developer, for
unit-tests, but that's about it.

It can do code-coverage and make sure that syntactically legal
programs do not cause errors.  With some imagination, it could also
test behavior with syntactically illegal programs: try putting two
tokens where zero/one are allowed by &quot;( ... )+&quot; in the grammar, or
inject a random token 1% of the time in the walk :-).

It cannot do validation versus requirements.

It can't do much for semantic validation without much additional help.

Taking a different tack, you could generate (for TreeParsers) input
audits that verify tree shape with a simple traversal by stripping out
the actions.  At the very least, this would help developer to see
problems.

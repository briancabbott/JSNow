<PRE>Hello antlr-interest,

I just fetched the source of ANTLR from perforce and noticed that
building the assembly (&quot;Uber jar&quot;) didn't succeed (the actual building
of ANTLR did), it failed with the following error message:

[ERROR] BUILD ERROR
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Error reading assemblies: Error reading descriptor at:
antlrjar.xml: Unrecognised tag: 'useProjectArtifact' (position:
START_TAG seen ... causes silly things to happen.\n      --&gt;\n
&lt;useProjectArtifact&gt;... @21:25)

My system is Ubuntu 9.10, I use maven 2.2.1 and the version of the
assembly plugin is 2.2-beta-4. I know next to nothing about maven, but
a helpful maven developer, jdcasey, in the #maven IRC channel (at
irc.codehaus.org) helped me do fix this. I attached the new
antlrjar.xml.



Also, he made some suggestions concerning the current antlrjar.xml
which might be helpful, I'll paste some lines from the IRC log here

22:40:42 &lt; jdcasey&gt; johannes: maybe the POM doesn't specify a version
of the assembly plugin...it may be resolving the latest released
version, which leaves
                    you open to changes in behavior. POMs should pin
this down, I'd say.
22:41:13 &lt; jdcasey&gt; actually, it leaves you open to using the version
specified in the super-POM for the maven version you're using, in the
case of the
                    assembly plugin
[------------snip---------------]
22:44:59 &lt; johannes&gt; jdcasey: I'll write a message to a antlr mailing
list concerning this
22:45:30 &lt; jdcasey&gt; cool, that'd be great...fwiw, the old descriptor
probably wasn't doing quite what they wanted there...it would have
included the main
                    project artifact, and plainly wasn't meant to :)
22:46:15 &lt; johannes&gt; what does that mean, main project artifact? (I
know next to nothing about mvn ;-).)
22:47:30 &lt; jdcasey&gt; johannes: they were trying to say, &quot;Process all of
the project dependencies by unpacking them into this new assembly&quot;
22:47:41 &lt; jdcasey&gt; the main project artifact is the jar (or whatever)
produced by the current build
22:47:59 &lt; jdcasey&gt; so, they didn't want that jar included, only the
jars of dependencies, which were to be unpacked
22:48:38 &lt; johannes&gt; jdcasey: but the resulting .jar worked?
22:48:39 &lt; jdcasey&gt; then, it looks like they caught the classes
compiled for the current project by using a fileSet
                    pointed at target/classes (from what I saw, anyway)
22:48:48 &lt; jdcasey&gt; yeah, b/c of that last bit :)
22:48:51 &lt; johannes&gt; hmm.
22:49:06 &lt; johannes&gt; maybe I should attach that chatlog to the mail?
22:49:14 &lt; jdcasey&gt; it amounts to the same thing, usually...whether
you unpack the jar you just built, or gather the
                    classes you used to build the jar in the first place
22:49:22 &lt; jdcasey&gt; up to you, but fine by me

HTH

Greets, Johannes

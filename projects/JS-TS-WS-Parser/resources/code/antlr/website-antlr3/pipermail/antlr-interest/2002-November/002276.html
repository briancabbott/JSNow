<PRE>Typically a root is chosen for its structure, not its content.  For instance
a simplistic variable declaration in C would look like #(NDeclarator type ID
(expr)?);  The NDeclarator is an imaginary type, which you might consider
using.  Again I ask why is it important to have the name be the root?
Typically symbols are stored in a symbol table so you can look them up by
scope and and name and that will point you to the right tree.  

What do you envision doing with the tree that makes it important to have the
name first?

Note that your structure for the tree with IDENT as an optional root muddles
things up.  You don't know from the start which of the tree alternatives you
are looking at.  This will slow down your tree traversal as well.  Some
people argue that tree grammars should avoid optional closures totally.
Take for instance a for loop.  In C any of the three expressions are
optional, but for my tree I don't want to decide based on content, so I
added an imaginary NEmptyExpression alternative to my expr rule.  So now a
missing expr in a for loop is forced in as an NEmptyExpression.  Imagine how
to handle the tree grammar if I left those three exprs optional.  It's not
pretty.  My simple tree grammar for &quot;for&quot; is this:

               #( &quot;for&quot;
                expr expr expr
                statement
                )

OK, let's get ready for round two!

The rational for this was to have the final output name of each column in
the select statement to always be the root. Now based on SQL92 that can be
the column name, an alias, or the group expression. Now I was starting to
look at making the initial parser always add the alias in to the tree.
Anyone have an example of a conditional rule in the parser that can add
stuff into the tree conditionally?

It is kind of weird to have optional matches like (IDENT^)? promoted to the
root.  What is your rationale for this?  Your tree rule would look like

selectColumn: #(IDENT groupExpression)
			| groupExpression
	;

I have battled this issue for two days now so I'm at a loss to how to solve
this problem. I created a initial parser for a basic SQL Select. One of my
key rules in the initial parser looks like this: groupExpression 
        : (&quot;avg&quot;^|&quot;max&quot;^|&quot;min&quot;^|&quot;sum&quot;^) OPEN_PAREN! (additiveExpression |
((&quot;all&quot; | &quot;distinct&quot;) field_name)) CLOSE_PAREN! (IDENT^)
        | (&quot;count&quot;^ OPEN_PAREN! ((&quot;all&quot; | &quot;distinct&quot;)? field_name | STAR)
CLOSE_PAREN! (IDENT^)?) 
        | additiveExpression (IDENT^)? 
        ; 
The result of this rule is that it builds the tree with the final name of
the column always being to top-most root. I.E. Select test, count(*),
count(*) test from foo; 
Results in a tree that looks like 
select 
        test 
        count 
                * 
        test 
                count 
                        * 
from 
        foo 
Now in my tree parser I have a two rules that look like this: 
selectColumn 
        : fieldName (groupExpression)? 
        ; 
        
groupExpression 
        : #(&quot;avg&quot; mathExpression) 
        { 
        } 
        | #(&quot;sum&quot; mathExpression) 
        { 
        } 
        | #(&quot;count&quot; (&quot;all&quot; | &quot;distinct&quot;)? (fieldName| STAR)) 
        { 
        } 
        | #(&quot;max&quot; mathExpression) 
        { 
        } 
        | #(&quot;min&quot; mathExpression) 
        { 
        } 
        ; 
These rules handle the 1st and 3rd cases in the select statement but not the
2nd where the count(*) doesn't have an alias. Does anyone have an idea how
to write something like selectColumn 
        : (fieldName)? (groupExpression)? 
        ; 
that is a little less ambiguous?

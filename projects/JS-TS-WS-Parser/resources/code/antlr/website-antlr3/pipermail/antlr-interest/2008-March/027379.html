Shouldn't do.  If the whole &quot;. Decimal&quot; block is made optional 
then the predicate should prevent it from consuming the dot if 
there aren't following digits, since having a predicate overrides 
the normally k=1 behaviour of the lexer.

Specifically:
   Real
     : Decimal
       ( ('.' Digit) =&gt; '.' Decimal )?
       ( ('e'|'E') ('+'|'-') Decimal )?
     ;

 &gt;Either Integer, Real or Eol ('.') is what I think is being
 &gt;looked for?

Probably, yes.  I was just offering an alternative solution (to 
always output Real, never Integer), in case the target language 
doesn't care about the distinction.  If the distinction *is* 
important then the explicit empty alt with type-reassignment that 
you proposed would be the better choice.  Maybe I didn't say that 
clearly enough :)

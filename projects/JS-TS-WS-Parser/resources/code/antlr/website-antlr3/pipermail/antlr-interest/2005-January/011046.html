Agreed.  I'm trying hard to improve with a simpler approach :)

&gt;&gt;<i> Do you think the new rewrite stuff would be easy to understand? Some

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> And this just looks like a wrong syntactic predicate.
</I>
I agree.  Ok, let's use -&gt; instead.

&gt;<i> Loring's stuff looks a little bit more consistent - ^{ } for actions,
</I>&gt;<i> ^() for trees, ^[] for nodes. I'm not enough into it to decide what's
</I>&gt;<i> better.
</I>
First note that ^(..) and ^[...] are the things you say you didn't like 
(except with # instead of ^) ;)

Anyway, I use ^(...) for tree:

r : A B -&gt; ^(A B) ;

is the same as:

r : A^ B ;

^[] for a node is useful when it's an operator; since I wouldn't allow 
that, i was thinking of using something similar in the tree rewrite:

r : A B -&gt; ^(DECL[args] A B) ;

where DECL[args] is like a constructor call to a node with imaginary 
DECL as the type and args as the other args.

With luck you won't need ^{actions} as operators, though in the rewrite 
section I'm thinking they may prove useful as in:

r : A B -&gt; ^(A B {an-expr-for-2nd-child} ) ;

&gt;<i> BTW is there currently a way of specifying that a (sub-)rule should 
</I>&gt;<i> stop
</I>&gt;<i> matching and exit? I've found myself trying to specify:
</I>&gt;<i> ( A B =&gt; subruleB
</I>&gt;<i> | A C =&gt; subruleC
</I>&gt;<i> | else =&gt; return
</I>&gt;<i> )
</I>
That should happen automatically right?  If it doesn't match the first 
two and you have a blank third, it should continue:

( A B =&gt;
|<i> A C =&gt;
</I>|<i>
</I>)

Stop matching? Or, do you mean &quot;match a production only if not followed 
by blort&quot;?

Well, the general replacement for the above that ANTLRworks can do 
automatically is:

A :
     F | D | E
     ( B | C )*
   ;

It's easy enough to see how it comes by this, especially if you 
look at the syntax diagram.  Each of the F, D, and E alts are 
terminals, since they don't reference another copy of 
A.  Therefore they can only occur once.

In the two remaining alts (A B and A C), the A is always on the 
left, so the terminals in the final rule must also always be on 
the left.  Now, since A is self-recursive, this means that &quot;A B&quot; 
could expand to &quot;F B&quot;, or to &quot;F B B&quot;, or even to &quot;F C C B C B&quot;, 
and so on.  So clearly the non-A portions of these alts need to be 
added with a star, since they can occur any number of times and in 
any order.

As to whether there's a formal writeup on this sort of thing, I 
really have no idea :)

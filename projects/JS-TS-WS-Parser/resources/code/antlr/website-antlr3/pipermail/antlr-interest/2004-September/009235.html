<PRE>&gt;<i> 1. do you really want to get answers for ANTLR that are out of date?
</I>&gt;<i> So, how far back in time should I put up on the net?  Should I put it
</I>&gt;<i> all up and then add a &quot;date&quot; field to the search?
</I>Possibly an option to order the result by dates (like search in google groups).
This days I have been using Lucene ( a jakarta apache java library to
index and search documents). I haven't used it a lot but it's very
nice and easy. And I think that you can modify the score function to
put more score on newer messages using a date field when you index
documents.


&gt;<i> 2. Should we just import into gmane?  Doesn't this just propagate the
</I>&gt;<i> problem that someday that site will go away and I'll have to find
</I>&gt;<i> another solution?  Seems like I should find a simple means of
</I>&gt;<i> displaying the email messages at antlr.org and then add the mail to the
</I>&gt;<i> search db.  I certainly like being in absolute control of my destiny
</I>&gt;<i> and data ;)
</I>Well, possibly a solution using lucene or your student aplication is
better than gname.
Or posibly not, I don't know how gname works.

&gt;<i> 3. Email addresses are all over the archives, which is a drag to
</I>&gt;<i> expose, but you'll note that your addresses are all already exposed on
</I>&gt;<i> the yahoogroups web pages.  So, i'm not sure this a &quot;problem&quot;.
</I>For me is a very, very big problem. Expose emails is a lot of SPAM.
And Yahoo don't expose the emails if you are not logged and subscribed
to the list.
For example your mail is displayed &lt;<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">parrt at c...</A>&gt; when I am not logged.
I think that before putting the mailbox in some documentation archive
a little Perl script have to do some regexp work in the emails.

And I want to say, that the mailing list archive, will be very useful
for the newbies to antlr like me.

Cheers,

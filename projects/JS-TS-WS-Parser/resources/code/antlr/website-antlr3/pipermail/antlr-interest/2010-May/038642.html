<PRE>Hi all,
I am using antlr version 3.2 and having trouble with gunit.
Specifically I need the junit java file generated by gunit to support 
the TreeAdaptor option.
I found various threads pointing to newer versions of gunit.
 
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/pages/viewpageattachments.action?pageId=3244061&amp;metadataLink=true">http://www.antlr.org/wiki/pages/viewpageattachments.action?pageId=3244061&amp;metadataLink=true</A>
The top two files on the list are: gunit-1.0.6b-src.tar.gz and 
gunit-1.0.6b.jar but I don't think they match
In other words I don't think the jar was built from those sources. The 
dates of these files (source being added months after the jar) made me 
nervous but I decided to assume they were related based on the matching 
version number.

I see in the sources a file junit.stg with the following line
       &lt;if(hasTreeAdaptor)&gt;&lt;\t&gt;&lt;\t&gt;this.treeAdaptorPath = 
&quot;&lt;treeAdaptorPath&gt;&quot;;&lt;endif&gt;
This gave me hope that the 1.0.6b version would solve my problem

So I tried the jar and still had the same problem.
When I dig into the jar I find that the junit.stg file does not have the 
line that adds the adapter.

Where can I get a jar with a gunit that matches the 1.0.6b sources or 
more specifically one that supports TreeAdapter in junt tests?

Any plans for an update to the antlr 3.2 version with the latest correct 
gunit?

Thanks,
-John

Hi Jim,

Aha, I see.
Yes we have see that T23 a lots in generated code ..


Interesting ... In v2 names of tokens was shown correctly
Right?


In v3 probably was some changes in architecture,
Which prevent from this nice automatic feature ..


Hmm. Actually it is not good, when a newer version loose nice features.
:<i>-)
</I>
Again, thank you very much Jim for points.



==========
Before click SEND button have come strange [and OPTIONAL] question to mind.

If v3 was designed to support old AST operators ^ !
And new re-write rules (ok for new)

But why was trashed feature of  ## = (IMAGE_TOKEN, ##) ?
    picture is broken.
    two operators self cannot resolve all tasks ..


If it was not touched, then porting was much easier I think.

Or I do not see big idea behind of this step?

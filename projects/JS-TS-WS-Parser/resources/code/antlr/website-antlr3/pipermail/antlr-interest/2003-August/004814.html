<PRE>I wish ANTLR was more stable!

We have been converting the C++ grammar file from use with
PCCTS to use with ANTLR 2.7.1 .

Having parsed support.i, CPPLexer.i and CPPParser.i at last, I
am now trying to get rid of all the unneccesary warnings from
generation of the grammar file using options{greedy = true;}:
and options{warnWhenFollowAmbig = false;}: .

For the former I have five pages of documentation printed from
your website last year. However, I can no longer find anything
about &quot;greedy&quot; on the ANTLR website but have now found a new
one which is options{generateAmbigWarnings = false;}: !

Options &quot;greedy = true&quot; was accepted by ANTLR 2.7.1, but
didn't seem to do anything.

Does it still exist and, if so, what should it do?

Options &quot;warnWhenFollowAmbig = false&quot; seems to work as
described with empty alternatives etc.

Options &quot;generateAmbigWarnings = false&quot; seems to do what I
want for other cases.

Is this equivalent to &quot;#pragma approx&quot; in PCCTS?

Why do we need all these options when &quot;#pragma approx&quot; in
PCCTS seemed to work ok?

<PRE>

I looked at both products. Both have advantages and disadvantages 
over each other. GOLDParser would allow us to use C# (like ANTLR), 
but also a few others like VBN.

I was hoping for good advice. All I got was &quot;RTFM!&quot;

 
&gt;<i> If you have to ask, the only reasonable response is &quot;RTFM!&quot;.  Even
</I>&gt;<i> cursory analysis gives a very clear answer.

<PRE>I would like to end up with the java classes:

     foo.bar.FoobarLexer
     foo.bar.FoobarParser

I start with a combined grammar file Foobar.g3 which includes a package 
statement:

     @header {
         package foo.bar;
     }

But the package statement only gets copied into FoobarParser.java and 
not FoobarLexer.java which then won't compile.

So it seems I need separate lexer and parser grammar files rather than a 
combined one. Obviously the files need to be named differently, and 
since antlr requires the filename to match the grammar name, it seems 
the best I can do is have java classes like so:

     foo.bar.FoobarXXXLexer
     foo.bar.FoobarParser

I guess that's kinda trivial to worry about, but out of curiousity, I 
was wondering if there's another way?

Thanks for any tips.

</PRE>

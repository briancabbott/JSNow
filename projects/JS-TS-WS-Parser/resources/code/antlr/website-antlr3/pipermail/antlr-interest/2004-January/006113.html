<PRE>If you haven't yet done so, please add this as an entry to the antlr.org
showcase page.  You may want to upload it to the downloads page as well.

Sounds cool!

Subject: [antlr-interest] Announcing GDL, a free IDL compatible incremental
compiler based on ANTLR

IDL stands here for Interactive Data Language which is a registered
trademark of Research Systems Inc. (see: <A HREF="http://www.rsinc.com">http://www.rsinc.com</A>)
It is particular useful for data analysis, supports OOP and has very
powerful array operations.

This project might be interesting for people reading this newsgroup as
GDL is based on ANTLR (2.7.2, C++ mode) and it demonstrates many of
ANTLR's possibilities.

Thanks from here to all ANTLR developers for providing this great tool!

Check out the grammer files (*.g in the gdl subdirectory).

There is a lexer/parser (gdlc.g),
a compiler (tree parser) (gdlc.tree.g)
and the interpreter (gdlc.i.g).

Furthermore there are cformat.g  format.g  format.in.g  format.out.g
for formatted input/output.

Any feedback is welcome.


GDL - GNU Data Language
Version: 0.6.1


DOWNLOAD:

<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnudatalanguage/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnudatalanguage/</A>


FEATURES:

Full syntax compatibility with IDL 6.0

All IDL language elements are supported, including:

Pointers,
Objects,
Structs,
Arrays,
System variables,
Common blocks,
Assoc variables,
All operators,
_EXRA and _REF_EXTRA keywords...

The file input output system is fully implemented
(Exception: For formatted I/O the C() sub-codes are not supported yet)

So far only some library routines are implemented (among them the
EXECUTE function). For a list enter HELP,/LIB at the command prompt.

No graphic support (graphical output (PLOT,...) and widgets)
is implemented so far.

Please see the README file for more details.

Check it out!

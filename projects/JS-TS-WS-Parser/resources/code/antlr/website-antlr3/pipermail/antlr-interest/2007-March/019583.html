<PRE>You might want to move up the release chain a little, but I have
released products based on 2.7.x and the C++ output on Windows, AIX
4.3/5.2/5.3, HPUX, Tru64, Solaris 2.7/2.8/2.9 and zOS (Unix mode
though).

 

There were some shoehorns required for the C++ runtime linking when the
startup binary was C produced, especially on HPUX and AIX, but it is
just a matter to f the right compile/linking options. All the code
changes we need to make to the output and runtime were provided back to
Ter/Ric and are in the product, so that should not be an issue. 

 

I have also tested the C output of ANTLR 3 on all of the above platforms
in 32 and 64 bit mode, in case that helps.

Hi All, 
Sorry if I have missed this on the website, but is there a comprehensive
list of all platforms that ANTLR has been tested on? 
We are embedding ANTLR 2.7.5 with our product and the test teams and
deployers need to know what platforms it has been tested on(and what
issues were faced and workarounds required) and if there are any sample
test buckets available for use. 
Thanks much! 
Neeraj

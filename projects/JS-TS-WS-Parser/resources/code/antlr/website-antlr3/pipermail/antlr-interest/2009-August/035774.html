I believe this is correct - Java's support beyond the BMP is confusing 
and somewhat patchy. Sometimes 'character' means a code point (a full 
UCS character, needing 4 bytes to fully specify) and sometimes, as in 
the char datatype, it means a 'code unit', a piece of UTF-16. Certainly 
anything that is ever going to be used to check the value of a char must 
be a code unit, not a code point, hence using surrogate pairs. This is 
awkward, but there's no sane way to get around it.

</I>&gt;<i> characters that high up.
</I>
There may be a problem in that case in the java code used to generate 
the C, but I'm not sure. I can see how there could be. If, however, 
you're transcoding input from whatever it is (UTF-8, UTF-16, something 
from ISO-2022, whatever) to UTF-32, surrogate pairs are likely to *not* 
work, as they aren't present in the resulting byte stream.

Well, that was a random outpouring...

Hello,

And thanks a lot for dealing with my &quot;novice&quot; questions :-)

I think I remember how to implement a stack machine, so that part 
should be relatively easy. I am not familiar with the term &quot;threaded 
code compiler though&quot;. 

Q1:
As for how to use ANTLR to implement a Stack Machine: Couldn't I 
simply emit the stack instructions from the Parser part of ANTLR? 
(That's what I did in the hand coded lexer / parser I wrote). What 
are the benefits of doing it walking an AST tree?

Additional info: I need a K&gt;1 kind of parser.

I feel pretty comfortable setting up the Lexer and Parser part in 
ANTLR (I think), but the TreeParser part is unfamiliar ground 
although I think I grasp the basics.

Q2:
What would be easier: Implementing a debugger for the Stack Machine 
or the solution where code is executed walking the tree (is this 
called a register machine?)

Thanks for your patitence and help.

Geir Ove

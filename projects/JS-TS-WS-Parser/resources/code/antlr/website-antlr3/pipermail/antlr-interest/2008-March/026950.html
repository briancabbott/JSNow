<PRE>As the noted logician Charles Lutwidge Dodgson wrote
March Hare: &#8230;Then you should say what you mean. 
Alice: I do; at least - at least I mean what I say -- that's the same thing, you know.
Hatter: Not the same thing a bit! Why, you might just as well say that, 'I see what I eat' is the same as 'I eat what I see'!
March Hare: You might just as well say, that &quot;I like what I get&quot; is the same thing as &quot;I get what I like&quot;! 
The Dormouse: You might just as well say, that &quot;I breathe when I sleep&quot; is the same thing as &quot;I sleep when I breathe&quot;!

The same lexer that got you 'cat' will get you 'chat'.  What meaning would you give that?  Now suppose the sentence was &quot;Viva la chat!&quot;.  Would your interpretation change?

Lexers understand the character syntax from which words are built, not the semantics of the words.

If the word &quot;cat&quot; isn't the &quot;meaning&quot; of those letters, then I'm
completely lost.
        Lost, of course...
Just letters, just words, just sentences, stream or tree or whatever...
These are not the &quot;meaning&quot; yet.

See <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat</A> for a description of &quot;cat&quot;
to understand the meaning of &quot;cat&quot;.

  No, it's not a real cat that I'm talking about here, obviously.

I'm talking about a Token that's part of a lexer output, which happensto have a text string associated
with it of &quot;cat&quot;. 

Ask a person what is the meaning of the letters 'c', 'a', and 't'(presumably in that order and surrounded by
non-letters), and they'll tell you the meaning is the word &quot;cat&quot;. Alexer does the same: produces
a meaningful output that represents the meaning of the input. 

A lexer (or any recognizer) certainly knows and applies &quot;meaning&quot;.  

I think people are equating &quot;meaning&quot; to semantics instead of seeingthat semantics is just one type
of meaning. A pretty printer that lexes, parses, and treewalks, andprints out the input in some nice
format may do no semantic analysis. But it &quot;knows the meaning&quot; of astatement, or else it wouldn't
be able to do it's job (say, follow every statement with a &quot;;&quot;).

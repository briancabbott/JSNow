DTDs are only useful in the XML world, ANTLR tree grammars in the ANTLR 
world. Are you thinking of some sort of transformation from DTD to tree 
grammar? Or the other way round? What for? A DTD is only good for 
validation while tree grammars usually contain both analysis and 
synthesis. The synthesis part of XML usually is contained in informal 
code that works on the DOM, SAX, JDOM or whatever data structure. So 
tree grammars are much more poweful than a DTD or a Schema. Comparing 
ANTLR tree grammars to transformation languages like XSLT would make 
much more sense.

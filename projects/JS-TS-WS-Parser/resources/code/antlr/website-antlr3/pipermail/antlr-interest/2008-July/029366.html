<PRE>I want to do a similar thing. I'm using slightly adapted versions of
ANTLRv3.g &lt;<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/grammar/ANTLR/ANTLRv3.g">http://www.antlr.org/grammar/ANTLR/ANTLRv3.g</A>&gt; and
ANTLRv3Tree.g&lt;<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/grammar/ANTLR/ANTLRv3Tree.g">http://www.antlr.org/grammar/ANTLR/ANTLRv3Tree.g</A>&gt;to
regenerate ANTLRv3 grammars. I have extended the walker (ANTLRv3Tree)
with template rewrite rules to regenerate the original antlr grammar, parsed
with antlrv3.g. It works great, except for the comments. These are placed in
a hidden channel and are not seen by the walker and thus not given to a
template rewrite rule. I realize it is not appropriate to place the comments
in the tree, because comments can be put everywhere and this would make the
parser to complex. But how exactly do I tell my walker to look for tokens in
the hidden channel or a self defined channel. Can someone give an example,
because I really don't know where to begin or what syntax to use?

&quot;you can search within the start and stop tokens for the AST rule and find
anything on channel 2, doing with it as you will.&quot;

How and where exactly do I need to do this? In ANTLRv3Tree.g itself and if
so with what syntax? Or is it done somewhere else in java code? I thought an
AST rule didn't have a stop token, only start?

An example what I'm trying to do:
parsing of a grammar:             * r: INTEGER ; //comments*
ANTLRv3.g makes a tree:       * (RULE r (BLOCK (ALT INTEGER EOA) EOB) EOR)*
Now from this tree I reconstruct the grammar but I get      *  r: INTEGER
;     *thus the comments are gone.
When I walk this tree in ANTLRv3Tree.g the rule &quot;rule&quot; is used. Should I add
something to &quot;rule&quot; in ANTLRv3Tree.g?

Sorry if this is a basic question, but an example would make things much
clearer.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I need to preserve comments and want to collect it in some data structure.
</I>&gt;<i>  How can we do that in ANTLR?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, I've following rule for comments:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> LINE_COMMENT
</I>&gt;<i>     :  '//' ~('\n'|'\r')* '\r'? '\n'   {$channel=HIDDEN;}
</I>&gt;<i>     ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The easiest way os to use your own channel, say 2, which means the parser
</I>&gt;<i> will ignore them but they are preserved in the input stream (actually they
</I>&gt;<i> are when HIDDEN but that really means 'anything you want to hide' and you
</I>&gt;<i> specifically want to inspect comments. Then, when you walk your tree
</I>&gt;<i> (assuming you are using a tree but that is best), at any point where the
</I>&gt;<i> comments are required, you can search within the start and stop tokens for
</I>&gt;<i> the AST rule and find anything on channel 2, doing with it as you will. You
</I>&gt;<i> can also do this from the parser of course.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other option is to pass the COMMENT token through as a normal token,
</I>&gt;<i> and create parser rules to assemble them at various points. The problem here
</I>&gt;<i> comes when the COMMENT can be anywhere, such as in the middle of
</I>&gt;<i> expressions, so the parser ends up having the COMMENT token everywhere and
</I>&gt;<i> complicates your grammar enormously.

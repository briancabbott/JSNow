<PRE>Thanks for the comments, Enrique

I would appreciate a less commercially restictive licence.
The example project I would use your package in does Algorithmic
Differentiaton on a maths language.
For this I need scope at each point in the tree and I need to update the
scope on each pass through the tree.

This work is done under contract so the option of charging for support is
not available.

I need to be able to provide to my customer a complete package they can
on-sell in what ever method their business model dictates with out
restriction.

I am happy to feed back improvements and bug fixes into utility packages
like yours as long as I can ship them with commercial software, without
licence problems.

regards
matthew

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Enrique,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nice looking package.  Unfortunately I cannot use it because your
</I>&gt;<i> licencing would force me to give away any work I use it with.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot; b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As a private software developer/contractor (no big support company
</I>&gt;<i> here) I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need to be able to charge for my work (keeps food on the table).
</I>&gt;<i> People who
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contract me also want to charge for my work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Could I encourage you (and other Antlr add-on developers) to keep the

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Matthew!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First of all, thanks for your feedbak!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The verb &quot;give away&quot; in your statement is a bit ambiguous. The GPL
</I>&gt;<i> only forces you to release your code along with your binaries, if you
</I>&gt;<i> make any releases. It does not force you to &quot;give it away&quot; in the
</I>&gt;<i> sense of &quot;give it away for free&quot;: you can certainly sell it, as long
</I>&gt;<i> as you provide the binaries+source or at least provide a link were you
</I>&gt;<i> can download the source. Plus, you don't have to provide any
</I>&gt;<i> guarantees or technical support for this code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is true that you allow legal file copies. But you're not required
</I>&gt;<i> to also make it available to the public without a charge - others
</I>&gt;<i> could. This is because free software business model is not
</I>&gt;<i> product-based, but service-based: you can still charge others for
</I>&gt;<i> installation, maintenance, formation, etc. You don't have to offer any
</I>&gt;<i> support if they don't pay you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Moreover, if you don't release your program to the public (this is,
</I>&gt;<i> you use it as an internal tool) you don't have to do anything; you can
</I>&gt;<i> keep your source for yourself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This said, you're the first one who has shown interest in the tool. I
</I>&gt;<i> made the effort to release it because I wanted people to use it; if
</I>&gt;<i> you're really going to use it, I can change the license to another a
</I>&gt;<i> bit more permissive, like LGPL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks a lot for taking the time of writing your opinion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Enrique.

<PRE>Robert,

On the contrary, I place a lot of value in answers from people who know what they don't know :)

Well, my ANTLR experience is limited to knocking out some pretty
straight forward parsers, so I wouldn't draw any conclusions from
anything I say!

Robert,

Fair enough.

So would I be right in thinking that the JavaCC Lexer is implemented
quite differently? That there is no ANTLR equivalent (either now or
planned, though I guess that is a question for Ter)?

Regards,

Richard.

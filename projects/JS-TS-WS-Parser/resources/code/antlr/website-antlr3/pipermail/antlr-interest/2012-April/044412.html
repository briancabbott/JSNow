<PRE>Hi Richard, list,

&gt;<i> Getting people to ask questions on SO makes sense, but bear in mind that

</I>&gt;<i> ambiguity that ANTLR is complaining about here?&quot;, but it really gets in the
</I>&gt;<i> way when someone needs more general help with input from more than one
</I>&gt;<i> person. Essentially you have a tree of depth one with the question as the
</I>&gt;<i> root and each answer as a leaf - although more than one person can answer,
</I>&gt;<i> the ordering is changed by votes and changed randomly when there are no
</I>&gt;<i> votes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Most of the questions asked on the mailing list are the type that can be
answered by a &quot;best&quot; answer. So these would be well suited for
stackoverflow.

However, you raise a valid point about question to which no single correct
answer exists: these are (very) likely to be closed by the community.
Discussions are indeed out of the question over there. I don't follow the
developers-mailing list of ANTLR, but I could imagine that discussions are
not uncommon over there.



&gt;<i> They do have comments on both the question and each answer that are ordered
</I>&gt;<i> chronologically - these were added as a 'sink' to dissuade people from
</I>&gt;<i> getting into debates in the answers themselves, but they are limited in
</I>&gt;<i> size and editability in order to further be hostile to the users desire to
</I>&gt;<i> actually communicate with eachother.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If the number comments beneath a question or answer get too large, a link
to chat room is automatically created where people can continue their
discussion. So yes, SO wants to keep the site &quot;clean&quot; from (large)
discussions, but they do facilitate a means to have one.



&gt;<i> And of course if you want to announce anything or get feedback like this
</I>&gt;<i> thread, you'll still need a mailing list or forum of your own.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Also a good point.
But this wouldn't necessarily have to be a mailing list: it could just be
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/news,">http://www.antlr.org/news,</A> but if there's still going to be a mailing list
for the developers of ANTLR, perhaps an announce-list might also be created.


Personally I use ANTLR, but I don't post on this so I don't know if my
&gt;<i> opinion counts much.
</I>

I'm not too active on the list as well, but as long as you raise valid
points, I think they will be taken into account.



&gt;<i> However, I read (or at least skim) every mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> thread. I probably won't see any SO questions because I don't use the site
</I>&gt;<i> that much any more due to the way it tries to turn people into faceless
</I>&gt;<i> question-answering automatons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
 That's a bit of an exaggeration, IMHO.

Regards,

Bart.

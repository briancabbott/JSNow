Hi Monty,

I am writing a compiler for a language that does not have single entry point
as such. It just contains statements which get used within function bodies
or program bodies. 

As an example, in a java application, you need to have a class definition
and a main function in atleast one of your java files. There is no such
requirement in this language and it can be treated as a language used to
write macros or small blocks of code.

Thanks much,

Bharath.

Most parsers I've worked with have one entry point for an entire 
program.  What kind of a grammar are you writing that has lots of 
different entry points?  What drives your parser?  Is it what decides 
which rule to call?  If so, figure out a way to script it so it does 
all the different rule calling.

Hi Ter!

I'd like to give this one a try just for the sake of it. It really  
doesn't matter to me whether it'll end up in ANTLR or not. I just  
like to
try to implement it to familiarize myself with the source.
As far as I can tell, I would need to have a look at antlr.g (to see  
if it is correctly recognizing the '!') and then add the supporting code
to codegen.g. After that I have to figure out how to do the actual  
codegeneration in Java.stg.
Is that correct?

Regards,

Kay

<PRE>Sounds to me like we have both a language problem (English is not your
first language? :-) and also a copyright-understanding problem.

Does your grammar (I haven't looked) contain any code? Because if it
doesn't, then the output file is not GPL. BECAUSE IT DOESN'T CONTAIN ANY
OF YOUR CODE!

The point to note is that when gcc compiles a c file, it *translates*
from c to object. The purpose of the object code is the same as the
purpose of the source code. Translation is a right restricted by
copyright.

But when you feed a grammar into Antlr, the stuff that comes out (the
lexer/parser) is NOT a translation. Most or all of it is *other*
*people's* code, and is licenced the way THEY say, not you. If your
grammar contains code that makes its way into the lexer/parser, then the
lexer/parser has multiple licences and it is YOUR responsibility to
avoid a licence clash. Antlr is NOT a compiler, like gcc. It is an
interpreter/code-generator, like lex/yacc/bison (and they have funny
licences, for *precisely* this reason!).

I know it's not a good analogy - but it's close - if you write a
sendmail m4 configuration file, you don't expect that to turn sendmail
into gpl code, do you?

Cheers,
Wol

This is the grammar.
The act files contain the code.
To merge code and grammar use annotation tool which can be obtained from
the 
files section of the antlr user group at yahoo.
The archive containes the Lexer, Parser and TreeParser.
I expect that the code found at  tree_vbs_php.act should not be usefull
for you
since it is responsible for translation of vb code into php.

The code generated from antlr based on this grammar files are also
covered from 
GPL IMHO.
If this is not the case, than if a C file is under GPL then the assembly
files 
generated from gcc would not be restriked from GPL.


Anyway, in a month I will release all the project, which aims to help 
translating sites written in ASP into PHP.

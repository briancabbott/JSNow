<PRE>Howdy,

I am working on a research project to develop a PL/SQL documentation 
tool in the hopes of picking up where some previous developers had left 
off years. My goal is create something javadoc-like, especially since 
PL/SQL supports multi line /* */ comments. The existing ANTLR grammer 
files out there just don't work, and it doesn't seem like me trying a 
crack at it would be all that hard. I picked up the Definitive ANTLR 
reference book earlier today, and so far I have successfully created an 
AST that models an input source code file into a nice relationship of 
parent package, procedure, function, and parameter nodes.

I'm stuck right now trying to get the lexer to appreciate the difference 
between the string literal &quot;in&quot; and the string literal &quot;is&quot;. Given this 
code sample...

procedure P_RenderPage(p_param1 varchar2, p_param2 in out number, 
p_param3 cursor%rowtype)

...the lexer is insisting through MismatchedCharacter exceptions that 
the &quot;in&quot; (following p_param2) really should be &quot;is&quot; because that matches 
a different token definition which drops any use of the &quot;is&quot; keyword 
altogether. It's not a language keyword relevant to generating docs. 
Here are the details:

Error Message:

line 2:52 mismatched character 'n' expecting 's'

That rules that should work just fine:

parameter
     :    ORACLE_IDENTIFIER ' ' parameter_modifier* oracle_type -&gt; 
^(PARAM ORACLE_IDENTIFIER oracle_type parameter_modifier*);

parameter_modifier
     :    ('in' | 'out' | 'nocopy') ' '*;

The token that sticking its nose where it doesn't belong:

STATEMENT_TERMINATORS
     :    ' '* (';' | 'is' | 'as' | 'end') ' '* { $channel = HIDDEN; };

I've read some elaborate commentary about how the lexer selects a rule 
to work with, but &quot;in&quot; and &quot;is&quot; are in fact different How can it 
possibly be messing that up? Is there anything I can do? I really should 
be capturing those parameter modifiers because they can signify some 
pretty important behavioral changes that belong in a good documentation 
tool.

Thanks in advance for any help!

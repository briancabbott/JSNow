 &gt;you don't care about.  As a root, it can only be a node so
 &gt;it's pretty easy to give the set of valid roots if necessary.

&quot;Easy&quot; is a relative term, depending on how many of them there are 
:<i>)

 &gt;Remember that AST construction is all about identifying the
 &gt;ops and pseudo-ops in your program, then making them roots.
 &gt;Why would you ever want to ingore what operation your looking 
at?

That's not the only use for them.  They can be used to indicate 
types or categories as well -- and in some contexts you care, 
while in others you might not.  This is especially true when you 
have multiple tree parsers reading a single AST input, since 
different walkers might care about different things.

 &gt;Oh, I just found one.  You want to find all ID refs...well,
 &gt;actually that is just:
 &gt;
 &gt;id : ID ;
 &gt;
 &gt;If you don't care about the root, just don't give it, right?
 &gt;
 &gt;x : ^(. ID) ;
 &gt;
 &gt;is identical to ID except it won't match ID as a root but
 &gt;plain ID would.

If ID on its own can match a tree of ^(FOO ID), then that's a bug.

 &gt;If you don't care about structure, one could argue why you're 
using
 &gt;a grammar to do that ;)

You might not care *sometimes*, in *some contexts*.  But you care 
a lot about other contexts.

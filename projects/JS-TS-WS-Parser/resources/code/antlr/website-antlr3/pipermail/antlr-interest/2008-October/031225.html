I see - I don't have access to that, but perhaps you can be an advocate
for this? In fact I have got the 3.1 and 3.1.1 stuff ready and published
on my own repository (ready for the real ANTLR one), so if no one does
the upload, then perhaps I will be ready for a repository sync anyway.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, all being well, we will soon have our own ANTLR repository for Ter
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to deploy to, which will be auto synced to Maven and then as new versions of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ANTLR are released, they should automatically show up in Maven.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Great news. That's certainly easier. Just wrote a blog post on how to
</I>&gt;<i> set this up:

</I>

I'll check this out - I have it all working locally, and today I am
going to see if the antlr.org stuff that Ter set up for me is also
working. I have also updated Dave Holdroyd's plugin and am going to make
a progammable interface to the tool so that we don't have to keep
copying code from Tool.java into the plugin - much neater obviously. 

Though there is a bit of a learning curce to set this up, I htink that
as a user of the tool sets it is really a good choice of build
environments (learning curve is a lot shorter if you are just
configuring a build and not making artifacts yourself).

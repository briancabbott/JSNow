<PRE>Hello ANTLR savants,
    I have a corpus that consists of natural language text
interspersed with occasional strings representing times (e.g. &quot;12:01
pm&quot;, &quot;noon&quot;, &quot;1 am&quot;) for which I have already built a working grammar
and parser.  *I'm not interested in parsing the natural language text*
-- I just want to capture whatever text appears between &quot;time&quot;
instances.
    I'd like to figure out a way to get Antlr to consider the text
(&quot;phrase&quot;) as this *very* loose pseudo-grammar:

phrase:
    (time (description)?)+;

time:
    numericTime | MIDNIGHT | NOON | other_cases_i'm_leaving_out;

description:
    nontime;

As I said, the &quot;time&quot;-related productions, which I've elided, do work,
and I'm hoping I can just drop them into this grammar as-is.  However,
I'm unable to come up with a workable definition of &quot;description&quot; or
&quot;nontime&quot; that works with them and doesn't create a mess of lexical
nondeterminism.  The ultimate goal is to apply it to a piece of text
like

&quot;8:00 am Woke up, got out of bed.  9am Ran a comb across my head.&quot;

and have it produce time/text pairs like

[8:00, &quot;Woke up, got out of bed.  &quot;], [9:00, &quot;Ran a comb across my
head.&quot;]

But recognizing the non-time text is beyond my laughable Antlr
(in)abilities.  I'm guessing that lexical predicates might provide a
way to do this, but I'd appreciate any and all tips you can offer.

Thanks!

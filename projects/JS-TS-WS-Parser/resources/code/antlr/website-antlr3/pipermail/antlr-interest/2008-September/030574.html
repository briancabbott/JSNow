<PRE>Hello,

that sounds great! I strongly prefer static code over dynamic data 
structures and look forward to C++ string templates.

There is another point that makes static code a better choice: 
deployment. Its easier to compile and link the string template code 
as opposed to deploying group files, runtime environment, etc

I understand that from web page design it is quite desireable to 
change string templates on the fly, but we don't need this ability 
(so we don't need on the fly compilation as well)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As part of converting ST to v3 grammars, I took a look at updating
</I>&gt;<i>things.  As I looked through all the complicated code that manages
</I>&gt;<i>dynamic scopes, parameters, and nested templates I realized that there
</I>&gt;<i>is a lot of stuff going on in there.  ST groove organically from a
</I>&gt;<i>simple string with holes in it to a sophisticated tree-based
</I>&gt;<i>interpreter. Tree-based Interpreters are much more difficult to build
</I>&gt;<i>then, say, a byte code interpreter. Further, debugging ST stuff is
</I>&gt;<i>quite difficult because all you have are objects and you have to chase
</I>&gt;<i>a lot of pointers through hash tables and so on to figure out what is
</I>&gt;<i>going on.  There is no code to step through related to your templates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I am contemplating moving to a JSP-like model where I generate Java
</I>&gt;<i>(or C# or Python, ...) instead of doing an interpreter. There are a
</I>&gt;<i>number of advantages:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>1. In principle, we could use the rechargeable architecture pattern of
</I>&gt;<i>ANTLR to generate whatever source code we want; C++ and so on. the
</I>&gt;<i>only requirement would be some sort of reflection still because I
</I>&gt;<i>don't want attributes to be typed in ST. That means that you'd need
</I>&gt;<i>RTTI for C++, which it supposedly has now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>2.  I would suspect that the templates would go much faster when
</I>&gt;<i>executing &quot;natively&quot; in Java.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>3. You could debug templates by stepping through them just like you do
</I>&gt;<i>ANTLR parsers. Templates would translate to Java methods. Groups would
</I>&gt;<i>translate to objects.  Like JSP, we could automatically compile things
</I>&gt;<i>in the background. This means that they would go slow the first time
</I>&gt;<i>you ran the template. Also, I would have to investigate a custom class
</I>&gt;<i>loader so that I could unload templates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'm planning on breaking with absolute backward compatibility to fix a
</I>&gt;<i>number of design flaws that came about because requirements changed
</I>&gt;<i>during the last eight years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So, it is a bit premature, but I like to have things to think about
</I>&gt;<i>while I'm waiting in line etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The idea of generating Java code is growing on me. Note that it would
</I>&gt;<i>only be generating Java or stay an interpreter. I would not do both.
</I>&gt;<i>Those are two totally separate products almost in terms of

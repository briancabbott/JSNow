</I>&gt;<i> Hi Ter,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> in a message on jguru.com you asked for suggestions for 2.7.2.
</I>&gt;<i> Well .... here are my suggestions (hope you don't mind I use
</I>&gt;<i> yahoo instead of jguru; I prefer email).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * With antlr you specify a lookahead for the complete grammar;
</I>&gt;<i> it is not possible to specify a lookahead per (sub)rule. I believe
</I>&gt;<i> javacc does support this, and I think it would be great if antlr
</I>&gt;<i> would allow different lookaheads on (sub)rule basis.
</I>&gt;<i> (That would eliminate many of the syntactic predicates I have
</I>&gt;<i> to use now).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    e.g.   myrule {options k=4;} :  A B C D | A B C E ;
</I>
This is an option I have considered.  It is only an optimization as 
ANTLR automatically determines the min lookahead to use (I think JavaCC 
*forces* you to specify the lookahead).

In this example, can you not set k=4 for the whole grammar?  You'll see 
in the output that k=1 is used whenever possible.

&gt;<i> * it used to be possible to have multiple lexers and parsers in
</I>&gt;<i> one grammar file. But that has been disabled (for whatever reason).
</I>&gt;<i> It would be great if this was enabled again, cause now i have to
</I>&gt;<i> put lexers in multiple grammar files (antlr doesn't support states, so
</I>&gt;<i> I need multiple lexers).
</I>
Streams/multiple lexers are much more powerful than lexer states.  I 
can't remember why Iimited 1 lexer to a file.  I remember there being a 
good reason though! ;)

&gt;<i> * as said in previous point, the lexer in antlr doesn't support
</I>&gt;<i> lexical states; the alternative is to use multiple lexers.
</I>&gt;<i> However, now I have to duplicate several lexer rules accross
</I>&gt;<i> different lexers; that's not a good thing!
</I>
Can you subclass effectively?

&gt;<i> Now, if it were possible to specify semantic predicates with
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;highest&quot; lexer rules (the ones that match a complete token),
</I>&gt;<i> then I could mimic lexer states using semantic predicates!
</I>&gt;<i> That would be a great improvement, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     TOKEN_A  :  (mystate == 1)? &quot;a&quot; ;
</I>&gt;<i>     TOKEN_A2 : (mystate == 2)? &quot;a&quot; ;
</I>
Well, it's easy enough to just do

TOKEN_A_A2
	:	(mystate == 1)? &quot;a&quot;
	|	(mystate == 2)? &quot;b&quot;
	;

Remember thought that feedback from the parser to the lexer is often 
dangerous (specially at k&gt;1).

&gt;<i> * another problem with lexers in antlr is the fact that I have to
</I>&gt;<i> combine conflicting rules into a common rule and use setType
</I>&gt;<i> to return the correct token.
</I>&gt;<i> Couldn't it be possible to specify syntactic predicates with the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;highest&quot; lexer rules (the ones that match a complete token).
</I>&gt;<i> The first lexer rule would be tried first, and then the next one, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> (similar to multiple sub-rules with syntactic predicates).
</I>&gt;<i> That way I could keep my lexer a lot more readable/maintainable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> e.g.
</I>&gt;<i>     TOKEN_FLOAT: (INT '.')=&gt; INT '.' INT ;
</I>&gt;<i>     TOKEN_INTEGER:  INT ;
</I>
See above solution.  BTW, you should left factor for efficiency:

TOKEN_F_I : INT ('.' INT) ;

&gt;<i> * with grammar inheritance it is possible to redefine a rule, but
</I>&gt;<i> as far as I know it is not possible to extend a rule without having
</I>&gt;<i> to repeat it's contents.
</I>&gt;<i> e.g    myRule : super.myRule | someExtraRule ;
</I>
correct...decided the syntactic complexity was not worth it.

&gt;<i> * when using grammar inheritance I have to specify all base
</I>&gt;<i> grammars on the command line. It would be nice if I could
</I>&gt;<i> specificy a list of search directories instead. (easier to manage)
</I>
True.  it would be nice.

&gt;<i> * the java code of the antlr parser generator is mixed with the
</I>&gt;<i> java code for the antlr runtime. It would be GREAT if you
</I>&gt;<i> could move the runtime classes to a separate package so there
</I>&gt;<i> is a clear distinction between runtime antlr classes and parser
</I>&gt;<i> generator classes.
</I>
Problem is that ANTLR is written in ANTLR.  A tough proposition to pull 
the stuff apart, but better separation  would be great :)

&gt;<i> * although resolving conflicts in antlr is a lot easier than in yacc,
</I>&gt;<i> it can still be difficult to understand why a conflict occurs.
</I>&gt;<i> It would be great if antlr would report the two different derivations
</I>&gt;<i> that conflict (and not only the rule where the conflict occurs).
</I>
Agreed.  I would like to see a highlighted grammar in HTML or something.

&gt;<i> * it would be nice if antlr would generate a _nextToken() function
</I>&gt;<i> instead of nextToken(). The default implementation of nextToken() would
</I>&gt;<i> just call _nextToken(), but I would have the possibility of redefining
</I>&gt;<i> the nextToken() function.
</I>
super.nextToken() should work for ya.

&gt;<i> * I use {options greedy=true} a lot; can't you introduce a special
</I>&gt;<i> symbol for this construct? e.g. [a]?  or  [a]* where the brackets
</I>&gt;<i> indicate greedy (or something like that)
</I>
Well, in all of my grammars I have not needed that much since it is the 
default behavior (in that case it only shuts off a warning message).  
Are you sure your grammars are clean as you can make them?

&gt;<i> * i have several parsers, and each parser defines some common
</I>&gt;<i> support methods/functions. Currently these functions are duplicated
</I>&gt;<i> between the parsers. I tried to put them in a common class
</I>&gt;<i> and derive my parsers from this common class, but antlr insists
</I>&gt;<i> that i defined this common class in a .g file; it can't be a plain java
</I>&gt;<i> class (that extends class LLkParser).
</I>&gt;<i> It would be nice if I could derive my parsers from my own
</I>&gt;<i> parser class; not only from an antlr generated parser class.
</I>
True, but you'd have to make sure your parser class derived from 
LLkParser or whatever.  Easier to just use delegation, right?  
commonToolsObject.mycommonMethod().

&gt;<i> * a nice feature I found in a different tool was the concept of defining
</I>&gt;<i> parser rules for &quot;hidden&quot; tokens. This can be used to parse
</I>&gt;<i> preprocessor statements, like (#include or COPY in cobol) by
</I>&gt;<i> specifying special grammar rules in the parser.
</I>&gt;<i> The concept is simple: hidden tokens are ignored unless there
</I>&gt;<i> are &quot;special&quot; rules that matche them.
</I>&gt;<i> (I'm not sure how this could be integrated in antlr, but I liked the
</I>&gt;<i> concept).
</I>
The token stream stuff should be a super set of that.  For example, you 
can send comments, preproc stuff, whitespace, and real tokens to the 
parser all on different &quot;channels&quot;.  The parser's actions are free to do 
what they want with them including running the stream through a piece of 
the grammar.  This is similar to my javadoc example.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * finally, I understand that the way you combine lookahead sets
</I>&gt;<i> can cause incorrect parsers (I experienced that just a week ago ...).
</I>&gt;<i> It would be nice if I could overrule the &quot;merging of lookahead sets&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> for specific rules.
</I>
More precisely, my lookahead computation only allows you to specify 
linear-approximate lookahead LL(k) not full LL(k) parsers.  This 
computation differs from what your human brain sees as intuitive.  I do 
this for efficiency reasons O(n x k) vs O(n^k). :)  Typically syn preds 
will take care of any issues you have. :)

Thanks much for the effort involved in making the suggestions. :)

Best regards,
Ter

<PRE>
&gt;<i> &gt; From:  Johannes Luber
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another improvement would be to allow a comma-separated list. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; With it one can record all versions of ANTLR, with which the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grammar works without any modifications.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The trouble with that is that it forces the user to predict the future.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe it will work with the next fifty versions, which may only have
</I>&gt;<i> changes
</I>&gt;<i> which don't affect the ultimate interpretation, such as bug fixes, speed
</I>&gt;<i> improvements, and the like, but there's no way to specify that.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only way this sort of thing works is for the source file to declare
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;this is the standard I was written to&quot;.  It is then up to the
</I>&gt;<i> interpreters,
</I>&gt;<i> past, present, and future, to either modify their interpretation to match
</I>&gt;<i> that of the specified standard (i.e. future ANTLR versions &quot;degrading&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> their
</I>&gt;<i> interpretation) or simply bail (e.g. ANTLR 3.1.2 tries to read a grammar
</I>&gt;<i> that says its written to the ANTLR 8.5.6 standard, which it of course has
</I>&gt;<i> no
</I>&gt;<i> idea what that even is, so it can't possibly interpret it).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A halfway solution used by some (autoconf comes to mind) is to list a
</I>&gt;<i> minimum required version of the interpreter.  It's a bit of a fine
</I>&gt;<i> distinction, but this tends to be problematic in the opposite direction:
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> forces the developer of the interpreter (i.e. Terence et al) to never
</I>&gt;<i> break
</I>&gt;<i> backward compatability - i.e. always have one foot in the past.  It also
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't actually tell anyone anything about the source; does
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;requires_ANTLR_version = 3.1.1&quot; mean it's using the &quot;^(&quot; or the &quot;#(&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> rewrite syntax?  No way to know until you hit the first one, so why bother
</I>&gt;<i> with the &quot;requires&quot; at all?
</I>
You misunderstand the intent. This option doesn't force ANTLR to behave in a particular way - it isn't built for supporting different modes and shouldn't be made this way. An example should makes this clearer:

A grammar is written for &quot;3.2&quot;. Now one uses &quot;3.2.1&quot;. ANTLR compares the strings and says: &quot;Hey, the author did only use 3.2. Using me may cause problems. Proceed at your own peril.&quot; If everything works out, the user can add &quot;3.2.1&quot; to suppress the warning.

A few months later 3.3 comes out. Ter decided to scrap the current rewrite approach and to switch over ANTLR/Yggdrasil&quot;. The user switches to 3.3, tries to generate the source code, but receives a stream of error messages. And the message is:  &quot;Hey, the author did only use 3.2 and 3.2.1. Using me may cause problems. Proceed at your own peril.&quot; Then the user knows that the cause is in the format switch (assuming he followed ANTLR's evolution), instead having to dig into the file.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Once one does a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; backwards-incompatible upgrade (be it bugfix, changed ANTLR 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; behaviour or the use of a new feature), the list is cleared. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How do you do that once your grammar leaves your PC?  Your customer
</I>&gt;<i> decides
</I>&gt;<i> to upgrade his ANTLR install and now your program won't compile.
</I>
See above example, but basically you don't and the user is at least warned of the possibility of breakage.

Johannes
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And if someone is unsure if a grammar change makes things 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; incompatible, he has to check merely the latest given version.

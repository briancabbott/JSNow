Hi Ter,

It's possible that the problem was that your mail archive is bigger
than the mails that had been uploaded to gmane?
Because for me the search works pretty well. And I found it very nice,
because it don't display directly any mail address as text, instead of
that use encrypted mails and images. And also I like the threading
feature.

The about your question:
&gt;<i> Are you sure y'all want me to upload old mail archives into this thing?
</I>For me yes. Gmane has a very good antispam solution. A lot better than
yahoo where you have   <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">XXXX at h</A> --&gt; Then if i use <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">XXXX at hotmail.com</A> I
think that I have at least a 10% of success. That for spammers it's an
authentic paradise.
But if you are working in a better personal solution, I understand
that you don't like too much to rely in third parties.


And about lgcraymer mail, I think also that will be not very difficult
to solve it with antlr (but i don't know if with the same features
that offers gmane).
And it  will be more easily if you like ASF 2.0 license and use some
indexing library like Lucene. I have used it and it's very easy to
learn and very good. But I think that you already know that, there's a
lucene faq in Jguru ;)

Cheers,

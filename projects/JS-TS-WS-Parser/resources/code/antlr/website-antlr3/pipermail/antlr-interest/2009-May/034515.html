for smaller outputs where you just want something that looks after 
memory for you and so on.

</I>It probably should, but you must be creating some huge structure for it 
to run out of memory. What are you parsing?

Or do you have your ulimits very low or something? Make sure you are are 
running 3.1.3 runtime as this has a fair bit of memory optimization on 
tree building.

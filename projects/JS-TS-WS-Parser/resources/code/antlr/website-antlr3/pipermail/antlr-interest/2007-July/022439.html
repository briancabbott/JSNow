Because you're talking about writing an ANTXR specification. My question 
was specifically about writing an ANTLR grammar for an XML document 
format.


&gt;<i> You're writing a grammar for your xml file.
</I>
A grammar, yes. But not an ANTLR grammar.


&gt;<i> You could write an XMI grammar quite easily.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ANTXR saves you from having to write a lexer and adds some
</I>&gt;<i> convenience syntax for attributes and xml-rule names.
</I>
Yes, I see that. But you're not addressing the question I asked: Why 
would someone write an ANTLR grammar for an XML document format?


&gt;<i> I know about the other XML parsers that you mention; it depends on
</I>&gt;<i> what you want to do with the xml. If you're just mapping xml to
</I>&gt;<i> objects, they'll work well. And DOM is just gross...
</I>
There are better and worse document object models. I've used XOM, which 
is much cleaner than the W3C DOM.


&gt;<i> -- Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, that's not really writing a parser for an XML document in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ANTLR, is it? It's interesting and novel and probably good for some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; uses, but the case in point was someone writing a purpose-built
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ANTLR parser for XMI specifically.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, there are other approaches that are not big chains of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if-then-else tests or Digester rules. There are several DOM (-like)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; APIs, e.g. as well as JiBX, JAXB, etc.

<PRE>Couldn't find an answer in the archives or FAQ, though it seems like an
obvious question.  I have a XXXParser which exports vocabulary XXX yielding
XXXTokenTypes.  I then define a tree parser XXXTreeParser and tell it to
import vocabulary XXX.  This works fine, but XXXTreeParser insists on
generating and using its own XXXTreeParserTokenTypes.  This is the exact
same set of tokens and it seems like needless duplication.  My questions:

(1) Is there a way to get the tree parser to simply reuse XXXTokenTypes?
(2) If not, is there some reason why the second token types class is
necessary?

Thanks,
Daniel

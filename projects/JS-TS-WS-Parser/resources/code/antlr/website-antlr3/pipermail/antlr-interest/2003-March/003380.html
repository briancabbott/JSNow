<PRE>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have run into an issue with ASTNULL and hetero-ASTs using Java as 
</I>&gt;<i> the target language (IIRC C# doesn't have ASTNULL and it isn't an 
</I>&gt;<i> issue with C++).
</I>
My comments about C# is inaccurate - it does have ASTNULL and hence 
the same problem. 

In my limited analysis, ASTNULL seems to be used as a performance 
optimization essentially. I guess my focus is now on ideas for 
ensuring ASTNULL plays nice with hetero-AST usage.

Is anyone mixing TreeParsers and hetero-ASTs?. Any issues?.

&gt;<i> Specifically, there are a few situations where ASTNULL is assigned 
</I>as 
&gt;<i> the value of a vriable then, an attempt is made to cast that 
</I>variable 
&gt;<i> whose value is ASTNULL to an hetero-AST class ==&gt; 
</I>classCastException! 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why does ANTLR-Java need ASTNULL?. 
</I>&gt;<i> Why isn't just &quot;null&quot; simply used as in ANTLR-C#?
</I>
The last question is misleading, ASTNULL is used in ANTL-C# too.

This issue only arises with TreeParsers incidentally and I've 
inherited a few I could do without ;-)

Cheers,

Michael

Howdy do!

All of the grammars should be already to go. I think the code  
generation templates are the only problem.   you need to modify the  
code generator grammar So that it pays attention of the !  for  
lexers.  I have already anticipated this problem and added a text  
pointer in the common token.  The getText  method returns the text  
pointer if not null else it looks for the indices into the text buffer.

Any rule that has a bang modifier must Create a local string to fill.  
Code must be inserted after the match routines to add the matched  
char to the local char buffer.  I suppose that the emit method must  
be altered to accept a string argument representing the text for the  
token.

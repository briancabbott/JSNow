<PRE>As I said, if I have wandered away from that recently, it is a mistake as it is intended to do this, so I will fix it up for the release of 3.1. I have been talking as if it already was like this because it is supposed to be :-)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If they want to replace the entire tree structure, then they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ignore ANTLR3_COMMON_TREE and inherit from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ANTLR3_BASE_TREE_ADAPTOR; this requires them to implement all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; methods, but means that their tree node could be some C++ type
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; completely divorced from ANTLR -- the adaptor carries the burden
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of converting the interfaces.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is exactly what I wanted to say. Thanks Gavin.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that this is exactly the reason why adaptors were introduced.
</I>&gt;<i> To be
</I>&gt;<i> completely independent of the ANTLR tree classes/structures. If you
</I>&gt;<i> omit
</I>&gt;<i> this independence then the adaptors are not real adaptors as they do
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> adapt your classes to something ANTLR can understand. In the current
</I>&gt;<i> situation you can remove all the &quot;adaptive&quot; functions from
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR3_BASE_TREE_ADAPTOR and call the functions directly on
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR3_BASE_TREE
</I>&gt;<i> - this change will preserve all other functionality, the uses will not
</I>&gt;<i> need
</I>&gt;<i> to notice it... But then the ANTLR3_BASE_TREE_ADAPTOR will consist of
</I>&gt;<i> functions that do just some sugar (i.e. becomeRoot()), these could be
</I>&gt;<i> also
</I>&gt;<i> removed somewhere else, and the rest will be just &quot;factory methods&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> And
</I>&gt;<i> hence the ANTLR3_BASE_TREE_ADAPTOR will be renamed to
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR3_BASE_TREE_FACTORY :-) It will be perfectly correct, the current
</I>&gt;<i> functionality will be entirely preserved, but this system will be
</I>&gt;<i> obviously
</I>&gt;<i> without adaptors...
</I>&gt;<i>

<PRE>Hi,

It might be because of some weird thing with the date's on the sources and
antlr.jar (or the absence of antlrall.jar) Could also be an artifact of the
rule to make .g files. Those use a little help file which is probably not
in the archive.

No need to apologize ;) When I first saw automake/libtool I thought they
were cool, but they only work really well in a defaultish setup. (The local
Solaris setup forces me to hardcode library paths in shared objects and
that's impossible to do with libtool atm) I also dislike all the copies of
settings in all submakefiles. I prefer to have one settings makefile that
fits all and local settings where needed.

Cheers,

Ric

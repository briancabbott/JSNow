<PRE>Thanks for the input!  I read the RTF spec some time ago, believe I know
how RTF works, and (luckily) I'm doing a different job.

This application doesn't need to understand RTF. Other than the few
commands I outline (that aren't RTF tags - note the forward slash not
backslash), the RTF is presently opaque to the application.  It's just a
bunch of bytes that need to be output in that order until a processing
instruction is encountered.  I believe some parser other than the RTF
parser is appropriate for the job I wish to do with these processing
instructions :-).

Cheers,

- Peter

Hi Sam,

Hmm,

As far as I have see, the 3.4 C implementation have weak-side because MANY
pointers to handlers present in the each object. In such was was imitated
virtual table of C++,   but instead of single pointer was inserted all funcs
of &quot;class&quot;

So this is main issue that will be removed with c++ version I think.

But I do not see how you going win with help of templates?
Can you show any small example?


======
To Terrence ...

I see you make big progress in challenge of left-recursions,
And before that in automates

I want to underline again, that C 3.4 was not faster actually of v2 C++

And ANTLR 3.4 still is slower for us than parser of SQLite - Lemon

I very recommend you make benches under profiles some your ANTLR grammar and
its analog of YACC and that Lemon.

I believe (relative) slowness of ANTLR comes from the fact of long chains of
function calls ... Yes this is strong side for debugging -- human style,,,
But weak side for RELEASE and speed.

My point is -- may be you can invent some way to produce two branches of
code 
A) for debugging  - funcs style
B) for release -- automate style

?

Although I don't have a good idea in mind of how it should be done, I 
have various reasons for wanting ANTLR to be able to do code weaving.

Multiple target languages;
Break up giant .g files;
Help for editors;
Make the grammar easier to read by relocating big actions.

It seems like the LHS could be used as a signature for weaving in 
actions from alternate grammars in a manner similar to the mixin 
pattern.  There's no super, the mixed in grammar overwrites methods for 
each LHS it implements.  I guess that's basically how inheritance works 
now but with multiple mixins.  If you overwrite an existing rule, it 
becomes inaccessible and is forever known as the new rule.

There might also be a special LHS syntax for overwriting just the 
action.  Like,

NEWLINE:: { gotit(); } ;

So that you could write out a grammar with no actions and mix in the 
actions from elsewhere.  This would allow .g files to be used as 
documentation as-is with implementation maintained elsewhere.

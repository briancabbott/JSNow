&gt;<i> We are in agreement here. IIRC, Kunle looked for opportunuties to
</I>&gt;<i> eliminate virtual methods on the critical path. Short of maintaining two
</I>&gt;<i> [nearly-]identical copies of the code (in release and debug classes -
</I>&gt;<i> same for lexer/tree-parsers), there didn't seem to be a way around this
</I>&gt;<i> (and others). Any ideas?

For Antlr v3, you can do the variants together as part of the
StringTemplates of the code generator -- via e.g., conditionals in the
templates and/or substitute templates.

&gt;&gt;<i> I'm interested that you didn't always get a speedup in the parser by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> caching the result of LA(). Still, I'd have left the code in there -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's not going to do any harm either way.
</I>
&gt;<i> It might _hurt_ performance. It did for some grammars in any case.
</I>
Yep, it's not nearly as simplistic as people seem to think.

&gt;<i> We actually decided to wait for ANTLR3 to overhaul things. To that end,
</I>&gt;<i> if you or anyone else have good, strong ideas about what a blazingly fast
</I>&gt;<i> lexer, parser, tree walker/parser should look like, I'm all ears. All the
</I>&gt;<i> better if you can supply source code snippets/samples - which can use
</I>&gt;<i> safe and/or unsafe features.
</I>
I'm not a C# guru so I'll refrain from making any specific comments on
that.

Algorithmically, the Antlr v3 obviates a lot of these kinds of &quot;just making
sure&quot; sillinesses.  Code generation-wise, the cleanliness of the model (so
far anyways :-) seems to make things pretty easy to change.  Part of that
is because there's a lot more focus on making code-gen support for a lot of
different languages easy/good/etc. (which definitely wasn't the case in
e.g. Antlr v2 and PCCTS).

In terms of the generated code itself, the needs of the Antlr model will
drive a lot of stuff but given the easy flexibility provided by the
StringTemplates, I think there's lots of room for experimenting with
different implementations.  For example, I'm particularly interested in
tweaks or outright different code generators targetting specific tradeoffs
(limited code &amp; data space, etc.).

Have fun,
	John

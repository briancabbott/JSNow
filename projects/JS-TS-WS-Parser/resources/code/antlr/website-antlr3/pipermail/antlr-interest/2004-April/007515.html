Don't hestiate to inform all of us at antlr-interest when you come back to this.

Well, I think this one should be tractable if only compiler supports member 
templates (all decent ones including MSVC 6.0 do support it, MSVC 6.0 can't 
handle friend templates does not support separate new[] operator and has 
nonstandard way of dealing with unsuccesfull allocations but those are minor 
problems). Then add smart_ptr version of dynamic_cast (easy) and thing 
should be ok.


&gt;<i> Must say that your library looks interesting.

Well, I needed something which would deal with reference cycles for my Antlr 
based project (and something which would not leak from time to time like 
Boehm's collector), and I didn't found anything good enough, hence Smieciuch.
&lt;more-shameless-plugging&gt;
As I side effect of the fact it doesn't do a refcounting and as an effect of 
the choosen design (the basic idea is not mine) is the possibility to do an 
unconstrained conversion to/from plain pointers (plain pointers take a role 
of weak pointers), given the object is allocated thorough GC version of new 
or new[]. Even some &quot;awfull&quot; things like casting 'this' to smartpointer or 
converting pointers to fields of GC managed objects into smartpointers are 
perfectly legal.
&lt;/more-shameless-plugging&gt;

<PRE>Hi,

Thanks a lot John for make it it clear. Although I see the problem and
I think that generates everyting, there are at least a couple of
problems with ANTLR:

1. The Warning is incorrect: Decision can match input such as &quot;IF&quot;
using multiple alternatives: 1, 4.  As a result, alternative(s) 4 were
disabled for that input.

This is non-sense to me since decision 1 in p_ExprSingle does not
match &quot;IF&quot;. Only decision 4 can match it (p_StepExpr)


2. What do those two alternatives (1 and 4) have to do with the
alternative 2 (p_ExitExpr) and a rule that is NOT used anywhere
(p_ReplaceExpr) ???

Regards,
Gabriel

</I>&gt;<i> Consider this, apparently valid, sentence in your language:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> REPLACE EXIT WITH EXIT WITH EXIT
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> now there are 2 ways to parse this sentence.

</I>&gt;<i> or REPLACE (EXIT WITH EXIT) WITH EXIT
</I>&gt;<i> where the parens group together the p_ExitExpr within

</I>&gt;<i> EXIT in each parse is a p_NCName.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and here are the parse trees for each hopefully making

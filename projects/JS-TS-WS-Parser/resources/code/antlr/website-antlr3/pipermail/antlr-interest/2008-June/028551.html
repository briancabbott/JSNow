As a new comer to ANTLR going through the wiki, I 'm able to find a lot 
of small specific articles for certain aspects of ANTLR ( which works 
well ) , but I was unable to find a solid 'Here is how you use ANTLR 
from the ground up' type of article for beginners.  The wiki might work 
well for experienced users who know what they are looking for, but for 
newcomers its overwhelming. 

I guess my main complaint is there is no order to the articles, it would 
be great to have a starting point, and a clear trail of articles to 
follow to learn ANTLR.

The book turns out to be exactly what I needed , but Im not suggesting 
putting that online.

ANTLR and parser generation is a complex topic and I'm sure there is no 
easy solution for organizing all the collective knowledge on it, and I 
certainly  appreciate all the work that you and others have put into it, 
so Thanks :).

Charlie

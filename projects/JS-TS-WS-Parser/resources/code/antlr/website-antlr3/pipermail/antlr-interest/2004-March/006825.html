<PRE>And no I am not suggesting we add PL/1 support ...

Exceptions are not handled consistently across languages. I think the
PL/1 mechanism is quite good (not that I've ever used PL/1 much), and
when a handler is invoked you basically get three choices - (1) fix the
problem and go back where you came from or (2) abort the program or (3)
&quot;continue to signal&quot; ie rethrow the exception and see if there's another
handler that can cope. That doesn't sound like Java-style to me at
all...

So really, what I'm saying, is that using exceptions is a bad idea. It's
bad enough restricting yourself to languages that support exceptions,
but you're restricting yourself to languages that support your kind of
exceptions. I'm a C / DATABASIC programmer by trade, neither of which
are OO languages, and I don't want to try for a paradigm shift only to
discover that my version of the new paradigm isn't supported :-)

Cheers,
Wol

Have to agree with Loring here.

Well in C++ you can compile without exception support which gives you a
faster and smaller binary, people in the embedded business might like
that.
I'm not sure though wether I would support two versions of the
runtime...

The argument for retargeting to a exceptionless generated code would
also
make a C codegenerator an (easy) option. (Hmm wonder how far you'd get
with
longjmp and co. talk about ugly...)

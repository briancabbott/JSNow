<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>This patch against 2.7.2 fixes (I think) an issue where ANTLR would
sometimes fail to complete a FOLLOW set computation, resulting in a
symptom of bogus &quot;unexpected token&quot; exceptions being thrown by the
generated parser. (My grammar is unusual - it's a literalistic
grammar for a YAML parser for Java - so I suspect I have triggered
an unusual edge case here.)

(The patch also includes some additional information I added to the
debug statements, but that's not important.)

Re-reading it, though, the pre-existing comment saying &quot;this is not
crucial&quot; should probably be changed to say the exact opposite! It
seems that this is the critical code path for breaking cycles, and the
person who wrote the comment thought that it wasn't (maybe it wasn't
then). Correct me if I'm wrong.

In any case, IMHO documenting the contract of the containing method
here would have avoided or mitigated this kind of issue. Either this
code was at fault or a caller was - but without documentation it
was hard to tell which was to blame.

Regards,

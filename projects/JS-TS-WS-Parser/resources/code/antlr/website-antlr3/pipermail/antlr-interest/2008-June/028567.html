<PRE>I'm glad you are looking to fix this, as this is affecting me know (as I reported previously).

We prefer to run ANTLR manually only when our grammar changes, and then commit the latest generated parsers and lexers
to our source control system (to be compiled with the rest of the sources). The problem is that
a) our grammar was developed on Windows and has \r\n as line endings
b) the rest of the lexer/parser generated code (from StringTemplate I assume) has only \n as line endings
c) our source control system (SVN) will not accept a file with inconsistent line endings

I can work around this in at least these 2 ways:
1)      Permanently change the line endings in the grammar file to just use \n
        (so it will be consistent with the rest of the generated code)
2)      Normalize the line endings of the parser/lexer each time they are generated
        (this is what I am doing now)

It could be fixed permanently if I could configure StringTemplate and/or ANTLR to
generate lexer/parser code which matches the line endings of my grammar.

FYI, here's a suggested way to configure this.
Subversion has a property called &quot;svn:eol-style&quot; whose value can be:
a) native (automatically determined based on the platform)
b) CRLF
c) LF
d) CR

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am proposing to normalize the use of \n in templates. If
</I>&gt;<i> you say \n you get \n or \r\n depending on locale.  Actually,
</I>&gt;<i> maybe we should make it a parameter you send to the template
</I>&gt;<i> group? You might have a Web server that should be sensitive
</I>&gt;<i> to the client locale not the server locale, right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When you say wrap=&quot;\n&quot; it would actually generate \r\n on a PC.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When you have a UNIX file with \n line endings, you would
</I>&gt;<i> still get \r \n on a PC.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that I really should fix this inside ST, but I
</I>&gt;<i> need to send out ANTLR v3.1 shortly. given all of the recent
</I>&gt;<i> bug fixes, should I add this to ST and then release ST 3.2
</I>&gt;<i> for use with ANTLR 3.1?
</I>&gt;<i>

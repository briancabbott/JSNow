<PRE>Something should exist if it is useful not if it doesn't hurt.
I have a question related with tokens too.
Could the lexer have a tokens section like the Parser has?
The reason I would like this is because from within lexer rules I change
the type of the Token which might an imaginary Token.
The workarounds I found are two.
1) Put lexer and parser in the same file and contribute in the same 
token types.So the imaginary tokens exist for the Lexer too.
The disadvantage is that the lexer and parser have to exist in the same
file.
2)Declare a protected empty lexer rule, example
protected IMAGINARY_TOKEN:;
The rule is never called so no complains from antlr and a new Token type
exists for IMAGINARY_TOKEN.
The disadvantage is that code is generated for the empty rule as well, 
which is a waste of resources.

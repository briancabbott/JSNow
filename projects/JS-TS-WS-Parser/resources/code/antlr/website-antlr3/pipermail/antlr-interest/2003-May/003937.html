<PRE>My take on this paper is that they are basically translating a 
domain-specific logic language to a procedural one, and that there is 
nothing special here.  At least they used ANTLR (in its PCCTS 
incarnation) for the implementation even if they mention lex and yacc 
in figure 2.

As far as the theorem-proving part of this goes, most of these use the 
&quot;resolution&quot; approach found in any good computer logic text (an intro 
to Prolog would probably discuss this).

As far as better tree rewrite support goes, that is planned for ANTLR 
3.  I haven't yet figured out whether JBURG is useful for this or not: 
 the BURG algorithm works on binary trees, and I have not had the time 
to see if ANTLR syntax trees (abstract syntax trees describe the 
grammar specification; ANTLR syntax trees replace parse trees and 
should probably be labeled &quot;concrete syntax trees&quot; or just &quot;syntax 
trees&quot;) can be easily mapped to the binary formalism.  If it can, it 
should be possible to use a set of BURG rules to generate a tree 
rewrite grammar instead of specifying the rewrite manually.

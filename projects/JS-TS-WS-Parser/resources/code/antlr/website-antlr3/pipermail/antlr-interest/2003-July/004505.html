It builds with lots of warnings but i have put a simple(2 line) patch to 
build with gcj at:
         <A HREF="http://www.trump.net.au/~rjc/antlr/">http://www.trump.net.au/~rjc/antlr/</A>

 From scratch:

     wget <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-2.7.2.tar.gz">http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-2.7.2.tar.gz</A>
     wget <A HREF="http://www.trump.net.au/~rjc/antlr/antlr-gcj.diff">http://www.trump.net.au/~rjc/antlr/antlr-gcj.diff</A>
     tar xvfz antlr-2.7.2.tar.gz
     cd antlr-2.7.2
     patch -p1 &lt; ../antlr-gcj.diff
     find antlr -name '*.class' -exec rm {} \;
     javac -classpath . antlr/build/*.java
     javac -classpath . antlr/J*.java
     java -classpath . antlr.build.Tool build
     java -classpath . antlr.build.Tool jar
     gcj -o antlr --main antlr.Tool antlr.jar

And there should be an executable called 'antlr' which runs antlr.Tool in 
the current directory

&gt;<i>That's a stripped binary? If I make a redhat 9 rpm I hope it can use the
</I>&gt;<i>redhat installed gcj.so, probably it's also possible to compile it
</I>&gt;<i>staticaly (or only do gcj.so statically).
</I>
I am not sure but i think libgcj has a hidden bytecode interpreter 
somewhere in the library for the dynamic java code generation and 
loading...might not link statically very well without pulling in the whole 
library.

&gt;<i>  And what's 2.6 Mb nowadays ;)
</I>&gt;<i>Advantage of using gcj is that it comes default nowadays with most linux
</I>&gt;<i>distributions, this unlike java for which you have to dig around first.
</I>&gt;<i>Also no classpath trouble. No trouble in figuring out you'd have to run
</I>&gt;<i>antlr.Tool etc. It would also open the opportunity for distributions to
</I>&gt;<i>ship antlr with/in place of pccts.
</I>
I also looked at the 2.7.2 configure/make/make install system - that 
appears to have got out of step with the java antlr.build system.  For 
instance antlr.jar is only the runtime if built with configure/make but is 
the whole lot if done with antlr.build

Also java source files are kind of different from C/C++ there are no 
includes(making for a much faster compile) and dependencies can be very 
complicated it might be better if the configure/make system just compiles 
everything from scratch.  This would also get rid of the 300k java_deps 
file reducing download size.

ie What is faster compiling 100k lines of java files or parsing a 300k text 
file figuring dependencies and stat'ing all the java source files then 
finally getting around to compiling the resulting set plus crossing fingers 
that java_deps is up to date and the one line java change you just made 
hasn't destroyed the dependency tree.

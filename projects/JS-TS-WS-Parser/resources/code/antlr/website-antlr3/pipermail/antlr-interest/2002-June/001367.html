I've been a lurker on this list for a while now and still haven't had 
the time to dig into ANTLR like I've wanted, but I have done a few 
things with AspectJ, so I'll put in my 2 cents.

This sounds like a prime candidate for aspects. With an Analyzer aspect, 
you could change the code in all the lookahead() methods of 
GrammarElement subclasses at &quot;weave&quot; time. You could even make the 
method abstract and let the aspect create concrete subclasses that 
implement lookahead() however the Analyzer needs it. You may end up with 
a nasty switch in the aspect, but the price is only paid at &quot;weave&quot; 
time. Alternatively you could specify different joinpoints for each of 
the subclasses to treat them separately to avoid the switch.

I agree that the editor delay is too fast and it is a major usability problem. It may be a particular problem with me as I have a hand tremor that causes more typos and pauses than is typical of others. FWIW I would probably prefer special treatment for a change in line due to either movement of the curser to a new line or entering a return key for while I am on the same line it is likely that I am considering more mods of that line.

In other words:
A. Wait till the user has stopped typing.
B. If the last keyboard or mouse entry has resulted in a change in line position and any key other than cursor movement has been entered since the last check do the check, otherwise
C. If &lt;Update Delay&gt; has passed, THEN do the check.

With &lt;Update Delay&gt; user definable, but a default of 0.5 seconds. (I would probably set it to 1 or 2 seconds.)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. It would be nice if the Errors/warnings/etc in the console could be
</I>&gt;<i> set to automatically clear itself out when you click generate,
</I>&gt;<i> especially if the grammar generates successfully. Maybe you can, but I

</I>
This would be very useful.

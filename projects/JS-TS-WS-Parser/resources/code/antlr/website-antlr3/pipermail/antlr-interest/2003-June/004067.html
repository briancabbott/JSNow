<PRE>Hi, I'm new to Antlr, and I have a problem for which I would welcome 
suggestions.  I'm trying to parse ColdFusion code, and the language 
allows strings to contain expressions.  The syntax is roughly the 
following: varname = &quot;... #expression_1# ...&quot; where the hash marks 
enclose a ColdFusion expression that is evaluated and substituted 
into the string at runtime.

The real problem is that the embedded expression is itself allowed 
to contain strings, so that a single source-code string may look 
like the following:

&quot;...#iif(&quot;a&quot; gt &quot;#b#&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;)#...&quot;

My problem is that I cannot think of a way to define a lexical rule 
that would recognize such a complex string.  In principle, the 
string should be parsed.  I can conceive of the lexer returning a 
token representing the entire string to the parser, and the parser 
then recursively lexing and parsing the string value until there are 
no more embedded hash-expressions.

I have no clue as to how I should proceed.  In order to lex the 
string, I seem to need a specialized routine that looks ahead, keeps 
track of nested expressions and their strings, and terminates only 
when the matching end quote outside of all expressions is 
encountered.

Any suggestions?

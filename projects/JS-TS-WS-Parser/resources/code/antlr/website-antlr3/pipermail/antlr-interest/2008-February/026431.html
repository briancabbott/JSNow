<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Sure it is confusing. I fell into this 'xy' trap, too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If COLON is defined and STAR is defined, then creating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; another token for ':*' in a *parser* rule is confusing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It should be fixed in antlr.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; At least, antlr should emit 'anonymous token' warning[s].
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I prefer literals because of simplicity / readability.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The tool needs to be patched, not users.
</I>
&gt;<i> If I understand your &quot;problem&quot; I don't think this can be fixed. If you
</I>&gt;<i> type ':*', how can ANTLR know you don't want ':*' as a single token.
</I>
Because:
 - there is only one grammar file for both lexer and parser
 - ':*' is mentioned in a parser rule only
 - there are lexer rules in that same file for ':' and '*'
 so lexer rules can be combined automatically to support parser rules

&gt;<i> It is perfectly valid to have ':', '*' and ':*' tokens, so this is
</I>&gt;<i> what ANTLR produces.
</I>&gt;<i> And emitting a warning just because you use a perfectly valid (if easily
</I>&gt;<i> misusable) construct doesn't seem right.
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately I don't think this is a case where ANTLR can protect
</I>&gt;<i> you from yourself.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps literals could be allowed in the parser but only to refer to tokens
</I>&gt;<i> defined in the lexer, generating an error otherwise. That should alleviate
</I>&gt;<i> many (if not all) of the issues while still allowing the stylistic choice
</I>&gt;<i> some seem to want.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tom.
</I>
Emitting a warning doesn't seem right, generating an error is better?
I feel OK with that. Although I actually think that allowing literals
in parser can enable to create some very simple grammars easier.
But magically creating tokens by default really is a bad choice.
Perhaps an option to explicitly allow creation of anonymous tokens
is the best solution.

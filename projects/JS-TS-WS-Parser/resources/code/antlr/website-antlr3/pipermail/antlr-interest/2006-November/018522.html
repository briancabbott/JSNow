<PRE>I now need to be able to use non-static character arrays in
productions used recursively to hold source code text passed up from
recursive calls. I assume this is the normal and safest way of dealing
with data from recursive calls.
 
Up till now I have been using static character arrays and not getting
all of the text. 
 
I currently obtain the appropriate line number for output for which I
use LT(1)-&gt;getLine() in printf statements.
 
However, when using non-static character arrays in productions used
recursively I am now finding that the use of LT(1)-&gt;getLine() totally
messes up the piece of text just returned which I want to print (with
the line number). 
 
Is there any obvious reason for this?
 
I am generating parser in C++ using Antlr 2.7.3
 
David.

<PRE>I agree that this should be easier to implement. My work-around is to
capture System.err in a buffer and, at the end of parsing, raise an
error if there is any text there. I know there are other ways of doing
this, but this way was simplest for me in that I didn't have to change
a single line of my grammar.

I have this encapsulated in a Ruby module (I use the Java target and
JRuby), so I don't have to think about it and can reuse the logic for
any grammar. This works fine for me now that I have it set up, but
writing to System.err by default seems to be less than ideal.

Also, Andy raises a very good point about many people only ever
creating a single ANTLR grammar. I think that's a good mindset to
approach the UI design with. (Of course, once they've created their
single ANTLR grammar and see how much fun it is, they'll be back for
more.)

&gt;<i> Jim,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you point out, the default case is that people will want to process their
</I>&gt;<i> own error messages,
</I>&gt;<i> rather than have ANTLR send them to stderr. So doesn't it make more sense to
</I>&gt;<i> have ANTLR package them into a data structure (which has a toString() method
</I>&gt;<i> which ANTLR calls and sends to stderr? The alternative is that people
</I>&gt;<i> have to either parse the error text or look at the ANTLR-generated code to
</I>&gt;<i> understand how to override the default behavior.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You mention reusing your error handling mechanism across &quot;virtually all&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> your
</I>&gt;<i> grammars. I think that for almost ANTLR users, the number of lexer/parsers
</I>&gt;<i> that they're
</I>&gt;<i> going to write is exactly 1. Better to make it as easy as possible to write
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> first grammar and not assume that they're going to be creating more grammars
</I>&gt;<i> anyway. Part of making it easy is to make it possible to build a
</I>&gt;<i> lexer/parser
</I>&gt;<i> as a &quot;black box&quot;, without having to ever look at the ANTLR-generated code.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I second that for I am about to write something quite similar. System.err
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is no good in a user oriented GUI application.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I can think of two possibilties to integrate such behaviour in ANTLR:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * grammar option like &quot;warnMode&quot;, i.e. with values &quot;console&quot; and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;collect&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'd like to have _one_ exceptions thrown if there ocurred any error while
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> parsing.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * possibility to set output stream for error messages via grammar option:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> @errors { System.err } (default)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Implementation of either should be no obstacle (*guess*).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the case of lexers, it is best to build a lexer that almost cannot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> throw errors as once you lex incorrectly then there isn't much you can do.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Having rules in the lexer that catch known common mistakes and/or catch any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> character that makes no sense in your lexer means that your whole solution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be more robust. For most lexers,. just having:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BADCHAR: . {insert your error code};
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As the last rule will improve things.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, in the case of lexer, parser and tree parser it is trivial to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> override the error output method and add your errors to collections/a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collection. As the standard error messages are usually of no use to a real
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> application (and they cannot be, there are too many things you might wish to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do on error), then you will almost certainly want to implement your own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> error output anyway. Just add the message to a collection. I do this with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> virtually every recognizer I write and it takes less time than learning some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new syntax and access methods for ANTLR (which everyone will then complain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about because they don't do exactly what they had in mind. ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, the method that is called has all the information that you could need,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but YOU have to make it in to a collection, format it in a way that makes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sense for your application, and present the errors to your users. There is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no generic solution that would provide much more than a different set of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> questions than there is right now. Sure, the errors could all be collected
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as objects that you then iterate, but then there is more code for people to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rip out when they don't want that!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Come on guys the error messages are an afternoons coding that you can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probably reuse on related projects (if they are living in the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> environment.) I last did this in C# and if it took an hour to get it all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> together I would be surprised. You only need to learn the ANTLR bit once.

</I>&gt;<i>       only in the few rules that require it?
</I>&gt;<i>    2. The grammar doesn't include any ^ or ! modifiers to impose any

</I>&gt;<i>       ought to do this in the simple cases (e.g. 'return'^

It is most likely not kosher, but if you can look at an LT in a sequence 
of tokens test if it is a virtual semicolon (without knowing anything 
but the adjoining tokens) then some sort of preprocessor (I'm thinking: 
lex, filter tokens into new lex stream, parse) might be able to convert 
what is needed. You might call the filter a TokenSedStream or something 
like that. I did something like that (but with the text) to deal with 
indentation sensitivity in my only attempt with ANTLR. As I said, not 
kosher, but if all else fails &quot;You gotta go with what works.&quot; (Law #37)

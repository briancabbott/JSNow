<PRE>Thanks for the feedback.

a. I did not use flex -F or -f. I used it out of the box, like &quot;flex
myspec.lex&quot;
b. I parsed from memory.
c. I used as input whatever the tool asked for and was easy to
implement. ANTLR, JLex, and JFlex each got a Reader (reading from a
char array in memory), Flex got a character array (via
yy_scan_bytes()). In the ANTLR, JLex, and JFlex specifications I
specified 8-bit character sets.
d. All initialization (calling constructors, initializing Flex, etc.)
was done outside the timing loop. Inside the loop, I only made the
calls to retrieve the next token. I ran each test a number of times
with similar results on each run.

I did not set testLiterals=false. My grammar has keywords. I guess I
could alternatively recognize them by setting the lookahead to
something like k=10. But would such a large lookahead really speed
things up?

Unfortunately I am not able to publish the proprietary specification I
used (it's a real-world grammar that my company uses for its
products). But as I indicated, it is not terribly sophisticated. I
would expect similar results, for example, with a lexer spec. for (a
subset of) C or Java. Perhaps someone would be interested in running
such tests?

Uli

I love the &quot;design pattern&quot; element, as it is following the same feeling 
as design patterns - and you'd hardly be the first to port the idea to 
another domain.

I guess the problem is that &quot;language design patterns&quot; sounds like 
you're designing languages. How about &quot;Design Patterns for Language 
Implementation&quot;, or are we *not* excluding langauge design, just wanting 
to make sure it's clear that implementation is there as well?

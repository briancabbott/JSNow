<PRE>Hi,

My current activity is to setup a coding rule engine for Ada95.

The main requirements are :
1 - the underlying parser should accept the whole Ada grammar
2 - coding rules must be easy to implement
3 - the engine must be very scalable (in order to process millions of LoC).

Now, I'll give more details and highlight some questions :

1 - For the moment I have an existing solutions based on ANTLRv3, and an 
Ada95 grammar for Python target (this grammar is based on Hibachi Ada95 
grammar for Java target, which is based on Ada95 grammar for Cpp target 
from O.Kellog).

2 - In the existing solution we have TreeWalker to walk on AST, but AST 
structure is really different from source code.

    * ??? I'm wondering if we can have an hybrid TreeWalker, which
      permits to walk on tree to match special tree patterns and then
      use the lexer to get some lines of code around the matching point ???
    * ??? Another approach : walking tree needs a lot of recursive
      algorithms, typically easy to write with a functionnal languages
      like Haskell, Caml, XSL... Did anyone try to build an hybrid
      engine (procedural/functionnal) for code analysis ???


3 - The existing solution isn't scalable at all, it's not ANTLR's fault, 
but the way it's encapsulated. The solution parse all files and keep 
ASTs in memory, then build a Model structure (hierarchy of packages, 
classes, operations...). In ower case, we need a more scalable approach 
like :

    * I start parsing all files one by one and keep AST on disk in a
      suitable form (??? any ideas to store AST efficiently on disk ???)
    * Then I reload the AST of one starting file and reload recursively
      AST for each dependencies (load on demand in fact)
    * Then we build the model and make some analysis

       ??? so, did anyone have to store/reload AST from disk? and how ???


Best regards,

Bruno.

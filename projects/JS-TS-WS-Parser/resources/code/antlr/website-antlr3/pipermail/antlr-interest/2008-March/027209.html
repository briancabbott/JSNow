<PRE>No, that isn't it. I define that myself in antlr3.h J But clearly it is something akin to that.

 

Anyway, I added it now and protected the windows #defines from redefinition.

Hi Jim,

 

It is because we define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN to exclude most of the unused stuff in our application. That macro prevents winsock.h from getting included by windows.h.

 

I can include the header. It does not appear to hurt anything.

 

Thanks,

Chris

Yeah - but what I want to know is why does everyone else's environment autoinclude it like mine does, but yours does not. I can include winsock_2.h but I am not convinced that you are supposed to. Maybe you are though, it probably does not harm.

 

Unless I start making the release version of the library #define out the socket related stuff for the debugger, then I would have to create a separate library and dynamically load it on each platform when the debugger is invoked. I did think about doing that, but then I have to write platform agnostic dll_open code, which isn't a huge problem but I didn't really have time. Linking with the dll version of winsock shouldn't be a big deal as it won't use up much space if you don't use the debugger (which I have not got working yet anyway ;-). Maybe I will come back to that later.

 

Jim

VS2005 SP1 is installed.

 

If I include &lt;winsock.h&gt; before I include my lexer.h file it compiles fine.

 

It would be nice to remove this requirement if you are not going to be using the debug facility. The application I'm working on does not use sockets.

 

It looks like you can check to see if _WINSOCKAPI_ is defined and if it is not then include winsock.h.

 

Thanks,

Chris

Hmm, how are you compiling it? I have no come across this and I just 10 seconds ago compiled generated code as C++ to fix a casting issue that someone else reported. If you have all the correct headers and include paths set up, then you should find in winsock.h:

 

typedef UINT_PTR        SOCKET;

 

Right clicking on the SOCKET declaration in antlr3debugeventlistener.h should take you straight to it (once you have compiled and have the browse info etc). So, if it doesn't then there is something amiss with your build environment, or you have perhaps #defined something before including the antlr3.h header, or in the project etc, which is causing the winsock includes to not include themselves.

 

Including antlr3.h should include everything for you regardless of the operating system/compiler, so it would be nice to get to the bottom of this so we can solve it for others in advance ;-) This error usually means that you are including the wrong headers. Did you load the .Net SDK or otherwise change the default header locations for VS 2005? This kind of error comes up when you install the wrong platform SDKs or out of date ones, but after VS2005 these types of problems seemed to go away because the header include order was fixed. 

 

Finally, you have installed VS2005 SP 1 right?

 

Jim

I'm trying to compile my C output in CPP and I get this error

 

libantlr3c-3.1.0b1\include\antlr3debugeventlistener.h(42) : error C2146: syntax error : missing ';' before identifier 'socket'

 

which corresponds to this:

 

antlr3debugeventlistener.h

/// The socket structure we receive after a successful accept on the serverSocket

///

SOCKET                        socket;

 

I looked for the SOCKET definition and didn't find one being used in my configuration. I did find a UNIX definition in antlr3defs.h:

 

// SOCKET not defined on Unix

// 

typedef     int                     SOCKET;

 

but it is not even reached because preprocessor ANTLR3_WINDOWS is defined 

 

Should I be including a windows socket header?

 

I'm in windows XP using VS2005 and VC++ 2005.

 

Thanks,

Chris

<PRE>Hello,

I'm trying to write a parser for MDX a query language
which looks remotely similar to SQL.  The BNF has
these two characteristics:

1) There are three or four rules which have several
indirect recursions between them.

2) The language contains several (~40) predefined
functions which occur on the right hand side of the
recursive rules.  I'm treating each separate function
name as it's own token.

I've carefully factored out all of the indirect left
recursions and built my parser.  Unfortunately, it
seems that as a result of the combination of (1) and
(2) above along with ANTLRs approximate lookahead, I
end up with almost each token type in each rule! 
Nothing is parsing correctly!  The first alternative
is matched pretty much each time.  I started just
sprinking syntactic predicates at every turn but it
seems that I'm going to need so many of them that once
I get this thing working it will be impractically
slow.

A couple of questions:

1) Given these two alternatives for example:

set: Children '(' item ')'
      |
     Descendents '(' item ')'

would most ANTLR users define 'children' and
'descendents' as separate tokens and recognize them in
the lexer or just write a rule something like:

set: Identifier '(' item ')' ?

2) One down side to having to factor out all of the
indirect left recursions is that what I'm left with
once I'm done is for certain rules less than intuitive
:<i>)  Is it possible that all of the recursions just
</I>make my language a bad candidate for an LL parser?  

Thanks in advance for any thoughts anyone might have
on these general questions.

-jason

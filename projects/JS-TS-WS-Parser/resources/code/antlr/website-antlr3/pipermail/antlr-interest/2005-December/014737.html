<PRE>I don't disagree in fact - especially the % bit, which was a lame joke
;-). I was just wondering whether there was some way to make it more
accessible to people starting out, the new tree rewrite stuff should
help quite a bit though because now I think about it, most of the
questions in the group seem to be about the syntax for that in ANTLR 2. 

IMO the ANTLR 3 Tree stuff is much more intuitive, but then again, once
you have stared at things long enough, almost anything starts to become
familiar (though I am not going to start using Perl or Python any time
soon myself).

Hi,

&gt;<i> Actually I wonder about the option of making a verbose and a symbolic
</I>&gt;<i> syntax. Most people look at things akin: {fred} ##&lt;$&gt;&gt;&lt;1&gt;//!!%
</I>
I'm also a fan of a more wordy syntax in general (we all hate Perl,
don't we?) but in the case of ANTLR I think it wouldn't help much.

People are used to use special characters for all the magic in language
recognition, and using full words within the rules (as opposed to
&quot;scope&quot; etc.) would limit the choice of rule names. Adding a special
character in front of the word is the worst of the two worlds, imho.

Martin

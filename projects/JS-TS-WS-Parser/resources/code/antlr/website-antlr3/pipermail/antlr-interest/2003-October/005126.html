<PRE>Hi..

In my earlier post, I understood Per differently. I think he want's to
parse &quot;method name{ &lt;whatever&gt; };&quot; and just eat up &lt;whatever&gt;, including
any nested braces, and put it in a variable, completely without lexing
and/or parsing it. Per, is this correct?

The result of all this being a tree something like this:

METHOD
 |
name-body

where the body node contains anything inside the {..} as it's text.

</I>I think you're missing the point. Define a ; as SEMI. The way I'd do it
(and this is all pseudocode) is

if_statement: &quot;IF&quot; lcurly (method)* rcurly &quot;ELSE&quot; lcurly (method)*
rcurly SEMI ;
method: blah_blah SEMI ;

That way, the lexer doesn't care whether ; is ending a method or an if
clause, and the parser won't get confused because when it hits a
right-curly it will be expecting an ELSE or a SEMI, and not a method.
And if the ELSE is optional you just mark it as such so when the parser
hits the right-curly after the if, it's expecting an ELSE or a SEMI and
nothing else.

Cheers,
Wol

Subject: [antlr-interest] Skipping grammar


I am pretty new to ANTLR so maybe this question is very trivial, if 
so even better then maybe it is a simple solution to my problem. 
Anyway I am struggling with writing a new parser in ANTLR to replace 
and old implementation in Flex/Bison, this to make a product that are 
open for implementation from both C++ as well as Java. 

The parser will parse a language that we are using to build 
databases, and it must support this language 100% if to be accepted. 

Here is the code cutting that I am struggling with.

method name{
  SomeText!()text[];
  if(a &lt; b &amp;&amp; b &lt; c){
     SomeText()!()[];
  }
  else{
     SomeText()!()[];
  };
};

I am not interesting in the expression that is inside the name 
method, I just want ANTLR to grab the text for me, and put it as a 
node inside the tree. The problem is the fact that the if/else 
statement is ending with a &quot;};&quot; which is the same token as the method 
end token, and I have no guarantee that there could be more that one 
inside the method. A solution would be to make a counter that will 
increase for each &quot;{&quot; and decrease for each &quot;}&quot;, then I would know 
when the method ends. To my frustration I don't know how I should 
make such a counter in ANTRL, that still supports implement in both 
Java or C++ code.
I would be really really happy if someone could help me with this 
problem!

Best reagards,

Per

Hi everyone,

I am just finishing work on multi-language error detection tool built 
using ANTLR. The tool analyzes ASTs built from Java, Pascal, and C 
grammars to find logic errors.

I'd like to take this error detection tool and catch some bugs. This 
isn't an ANTLR question, just asking for suggestions.  What types of 
common logic errors are easy to find in real world programs? I can 
find many different types of simple rule-based errors with the tool 
such as:

Never divide by 0. 
Never dereference a null pointer. 
Never use an uninitialized variable. 

The tool currently works for Java and Pascal. It should be working 
soon for C. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what type of 
errors to look for and what programs (with source code available) 
would be good to look at? I don't mind looking at older versions of 
popular programs, finding bugs that have already been found would 
still be a good test for my program. I appreciate any suggestions.

I would also like to thank the group members and others that have 
contributed to ANTLR.  The response here has been excellent for each 
of the questions that I have had.

Many thanks,

Steve

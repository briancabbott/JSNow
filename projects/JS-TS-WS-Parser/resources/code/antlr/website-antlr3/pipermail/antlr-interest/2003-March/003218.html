<PRE>Hello all,

After several hours of sackcloth and ashes, I have realized that it 
is an existing bug that ANTLR doesn't work with STLPort.  I really 
want to abandon SGI's STL because it is such a pain in the butt, so I 
was experimenting w/ STLPort, but have run into a problem with this 
EOF thing:

(from the TODO in $\lib\cpp):

  ANTLR with STL Port. Changing the EOF define to 
char_traits&lt;char&gt;::eof()
  breaks things for gcc-2.95.2. Fix this in next release portably.

(end of snippet)

In the 2.7.0 and 2.7.1 release, there is a &quot;Fix this in the next 
release&quot; which I am afraid will never happen.  Is there a fix I can 
do on my end, or is there a mere configuration switch I need to do, 
or are there any plans to ever fix this?  I am new to the STL world, 
but I had heard that everyone uses STLPort...obviously, not, because 
at least some of us use antlr.  ;)

Should i be worried that this post is 30 months old, and it is still 
not fixed??

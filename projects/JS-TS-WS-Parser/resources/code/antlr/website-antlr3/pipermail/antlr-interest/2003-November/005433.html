<PRE>Chris--

Welcome!  The performance differential is not a surprise--that's 
sort of an artifact of ANTLR 2's history.  Ter was too busy with 
jGuru to do much polishing.  That should change with ANTLR 3, which 
will be a major upgrade, both in terms of features and 
implementation.

I've looked over the LLK source, and can see that you have 
incorporated design features from several other language translation 
tools.  I'm curious:  why did you choose the LLK syntax?  It is not 
what I would have chosen.

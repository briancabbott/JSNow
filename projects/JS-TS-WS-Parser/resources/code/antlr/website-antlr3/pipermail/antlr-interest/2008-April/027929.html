<PRE>You can ignore the @init block. I was going to show that you could set that to true for more than one byFunction and use conditional rewrites, but I decided that that was not really a good way to do it when you didn't have to.

heheh...not really. client preference. unless you have compelling argument against?

thanks, that works. however, what does the @init block do?

Are you sure you want that? ;-)

 

unionFunction

@init

{

     boolean  multi = false;

}

 : b+=byFunction 

     (    (op=UnionOp b+=byFunction )+

 

                     -&gt; ^($op $b+)

 

           |         -&gt; $b

     )

;

 

Assuming that UnionOp generates only one node, that should work for all of them.

So, given a rule like this:

unionFunction
:<i> (byFunction -&gt; byFunction)
</I>(opNode=UnionOp b=byFunction -&gt; ^(Function[$opNode] $unionFunction $b) )*;

the following input:

a union b union c

creates a tree which consists of a union node with two children, one of which is another union node (essentially &quot;(a union b) union c&quot;).

what i want in such scenarios is to output a single union node with three children. how is this done?

Thanks,
Marko

<PRE>I haven't had the opportunity yet to try this out.  I've been pulled
away for other work but will let you know how this all turns out as soon
as possible.
 
 
Thank you,
 
 
W.

Subject: Re: [antlr-interest] using ANTLR with netbeans


Hi,
 
I hope by writing &quot;antlr works&quot; in my previous email, I did not cause
any confusion. By &quot;antlr works&quot;, I meant all your java classes which are
produced by antlr and you want to execute in netBeans environment. I try
to explain it more clearly. I hope it works. I know how frustrating it
can be.
 
As I explained previously, you need to place the two runtime files
(antlr and org which I gave you not anything else) in the source package
you keep your java files produced by antlr like lexer, parser and tree
walker. In my machine, the runtime files (org and antlr) are placed at
the address: C:\MyProjects\FinalFinal\src . So as all the other packages
which include my parser, etc produced by antlr. I will send you a
snapshot of the netBeans interface. In the snapshots you can see some
packages which their names start with antlr and org. You need them. But
not the ones for other languages like c and etc. but do not worry they
do not cause any harms. You do not have to go and create packages for
each of them. If you drag and drop the files I gave you to the source
package of the project (like FinalFinal in the snapshot), the files will
look like the ones in the snapshot. Along with them in the same &quot;source
packages&quot;, create your classes. (again just drag and drop the text files
of lexer and parser and tree walker created by antlr and stored in an
address similar to C:\tmp\antlrworks into the created package for your
antlr java classes like finalPro at
C:\MyProjects\FinalFinal\src\finalPro. See the snapshot). Make sure the
java classes in your package like finalpro have the name of the right
package &quot;finalPro&quot; and have the import line &quot;import
antlr.RecognitionException;&quot;. As java classes produced by antlr do not
have this import line and you have to add it yourself.
 
 
Best of luck,
 
Al

	Hi,
	 
	I have had all those problems before. I use NeatBean 5.5. I have
enclosed the zip file of all the Runtime packages needed. I did this:
	 
	There are two files in the enclosed zip. org and antlr. I placed
the two files in the source file of the package containing my antlr
works. It has been working for me perfectly.
	 
	 
	Best wishes,
	 
	Al

		I am using netbeans 5.5.1 and I've been unable to figure
out how to use the runtime jar as a library. 
		I've placed the file in the classpath, added a new
classpath, added the source directory and have not had success being
able to use ANTLR with netbeans.
		Is there a way to do this?

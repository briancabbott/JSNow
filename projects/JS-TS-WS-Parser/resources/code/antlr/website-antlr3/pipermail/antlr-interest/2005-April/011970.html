</I>Well it depends I guess. But in my experience the delta is not very large,
a few lines of code at the most. Unless we have a copy, paste. However I only 
update the model, rarely the view that depend on it.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And if you are going to be running in a background thread means that
</I>&gt;<i> you are out of sync with the document that is currently being edited.
</I>&gt;<i> Thus all the current info you have pretty much amounts to zero. You
</I>&gt;<i> can't just query a tree and find out the context of say an offset,
</I>&gt;<i> cause the context might have changed from the last time the tree was
</I>&gt;<i> updated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You obviously can't use it to do auto formatting wile typing cause
</I>&gt;<i> that would require a completly synced tree.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You try doing highlighting with it and you might find that the offsets
</I>&gt;<i> you got to update have already has their text changed by the time they
</I>&gt;<i> are updated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also it makes all your components 10 times more complex cause now they
</I>&gt;<i> have to deal with 'delta changes' instead of just a tree.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also if you are doing parsing in background, the user won't feel at
</I>&gt;<i> all whether you are doing a full parse each time or just an
</I>&gt;<i> incremental parse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree incremental parse is way faster than a full parse, but then we
</I>&gt;<i> are talking of times in milliseconds, which won't be noticed at all if
</I>&gt;<i> you are parsing in another thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So my question is that other than having a little more accuracy with
</I>&gt;<i> auto complete, ehat exaclty is the use of all this incremental stuff,
</I>&gt;<i> if you can't use the info at run time.
</I>I'm currently implementing incremental parsing for my &quot;Visual DataFlex plugin&quot; 
for Eclipse. Since the grammar is fairly large and not very fast I see no 
other option because:

* The outline view should be accurate.
* The &quot;highlight range indicator&quot; should be accurate.
* Automatic indentation should be accurate.
* Content assist should be accurate.
* Templates should be accurate.
* Specialized search should be accurate.
* etc. etc.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't say that we can run the parser at real short intervals , ie
</I>&gt;<i> every 50ms instead of 500ms, cause then again you are just playing
</I>&gt;<i> with luck and hoping the user types slow.

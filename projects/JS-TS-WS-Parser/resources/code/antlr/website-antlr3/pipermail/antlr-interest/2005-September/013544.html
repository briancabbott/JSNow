<PRE>[I suspect this has been asked before but couldn't find the list  
search function...]

Hello,

I've imported antlr 2.7.5 into our subversion repository.   
Unfortunately, a simple checkout (complete with .svn sub directories)  
of antlr won't successfully do a simple make (after ./configure -- 
with-javac=javac).  Error is:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Unable to compile ANTLR grammar file(s)
/ordept/devish/apps/vis/trunk/dev/srclibs/thirdparty/antlr/antlr/../ 
antlr/antlr.g
Reason(s):
(a) there's no /ordept/devish/apps/vis/trunk/dev/srclibs/thirdparty/ 
antlr/antlr/antlr.jar
(b) there's no /ordept/devish/apps/vis/trunk/dev/srclibs/thirdparty/ 
antlr/antlr.jar
(c) there's no /ordept/devish/apps/vis/trunk/dev/srclibs/thirdparty/ 
antlr/lib/antlr.jar
(d) options --with-antlr-jar --with-antlr-cmd not applied
      or value given is not correct.
You may resolve this problem by setting environment variable
$ANTLR_JAR.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If I do an export (w/o .svn sub directories) of antlr, the

     ./configure --with-javac=javac
     make

sequence functions as expected.

Except for the .svn sub directories, there are no differences between  
the two cases.

I'm guessing those extra directories are confusing some Makefile's or  
possibly the configure.

Any work known work arounds?

<PRE>Hi!

As I was working on a project I had a bug that took some time to figure 
out. It crashed and burned as I compiled it. The trouble was that I hade 
a rule named const in my grammar, and producting a routine called const 
in the produced C code. Now, const is a reserved word so GCC spewed 
severly upon it.

If I had used prefixing it would have solved itself. Renaming it solved 
it, but you would rather want either a warning/error occur up in the 
ANTLR front or a backend renaming to occur to avoid it, if needed (i.e. 
if reserved for the target language and no prefixing is used).

I think this problem can occur with other languages than C, so it could 
be worth considering. Oh, I was using 3.0.1 if you where asking.

Cheers,
Magnus

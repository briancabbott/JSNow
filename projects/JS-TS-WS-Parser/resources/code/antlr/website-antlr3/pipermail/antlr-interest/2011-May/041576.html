Currently ANTLR lexers greedily consume the longest possible sequence of
acceptable characters for each token.

So I think that when the characters that follow the '&gt;' match TEXT e.g.
are not one of the SPECIAL_CHARS then the entire sequence is matched as
TEXT. and the same drill for the INDENT token.

You can verify this by simply trying input such as &quot;&gt;$&quot; or &quot; $&quot; -- each
on a line by itself. I would think you would then get either a QUOTE or
INDENT followed by whatever token matches a $. (Note, this may not parse
correctly but you should still see the 2 token sequence...)

Hope this helps...

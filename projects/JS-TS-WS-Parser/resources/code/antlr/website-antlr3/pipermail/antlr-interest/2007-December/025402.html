Tell you what - if I give up after trying a bit longer to find a
pared-down version that still has the problem, then I may take you
up on that and send the whole thing.  It's for a language that's
never been documented except for its historical sparsely-commented
parser hand-coded in C by someone who shouldn't have ... and hacked on
for years (hmm, how many criteria on the &quot;ugly parser project&quot;
list did I just hit?) so I bet you're NOT really looking forward
to being hit with the whole thing. ;)

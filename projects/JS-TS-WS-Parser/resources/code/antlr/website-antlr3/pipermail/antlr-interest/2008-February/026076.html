I don't understand why ANTLRWorks can't deal with the grammars being
in separate files and support debugging without using the remote
option. I doubt this is something it couldn't do. I suspect it's just
something that Jean Bovet hasn't gotten around to implementing.

&gt;<i> I think one of the difficulties I'm having is that I don't *have* a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;build script&quot; to modify. I guess there's an unstated, fairly
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable assumption that one is attempting to build a parser that
</I>&gt;<i> does something: hence one sooner or later has to write a program that
</I>&gt;<i> does something with it. Hence, one has a build infrastructure with a
</I>&gt;<i> script of some kind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, I don't have any of that, because I&quot;m not attempting to
</I>&gt;<i> build a working program here; my goal is purely to produce a grammar
</I>&gt;<i> that describes a certain language. I'm using ANTLR primarily to verify
</I>&gt;<i> that the grammar is in fact correct. I don't really expect to use the
</I>&gt;<i> generated Java file for anything.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of this explains why I panic whenever the ANTLRworks IDE fails for

</I>&gt;<i> I guess I'll have to look at setting up a more serious build

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (in the short term, I've remerged my two grammars)
</I>
That makes sense. If you ever decide to create an Ant build script,
I'd be glad to help by sharing mine.

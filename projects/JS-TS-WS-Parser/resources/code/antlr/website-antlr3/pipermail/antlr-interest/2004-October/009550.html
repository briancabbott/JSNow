Hello Maurice,

As the latest supplier of the C++ parser in the antlr.org site I 
can confirm that I have not attempted to generate an AST as yet.

I assume the recent correspondence on this list refers to our 
version 3.0 dated 1 July 2004.

I was glad to hear that you have been able to run it 
successfully. However, if you find any problems with it please 
let me know.

We include our application code via pre-processor conditional 
statements and using subclassing, similar to the demonstration 
module, MyCode.cpp, to keep it separate from the parser code.

I would very much like to offer tree parser output, but I do not 
have sufficient spare time at present. If anyone would like to 
co-operate with me to modify the parser to produce a suitable 
AST from this parser then I would be pleased to help.

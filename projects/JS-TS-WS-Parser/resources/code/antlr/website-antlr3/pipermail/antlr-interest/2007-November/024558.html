I got rid of all the book keeping code for _state.failed, which gives me 
the small but still measurable perf gain (I had to reintroduce a similar 
flag when memoization is turned on, but it is much cheaper).
Adding the try..except block (only in synpredNN methods, where the 
parser is interested of the success/failure result) should be very cheap 
in Python AFAIK.
Also note that my perf timing was very simple. I just timed the whole 
process runtime, including interpreter startup (which should not be 
significant, because the parsed file was big enough to take a few 
seconds) and most significantly including the lexing phase - where most 
of the time is spent and the lexer was not effected by this change!
So the parser itself should see more than these 2%.
And it would probably be nice to have a grammar and input where 
backtracking fails very often to see the worst case impact of raising 
exceptions. Java.g had ~750 BacktrackingFailed exceptions for the 80KB 
java input file.

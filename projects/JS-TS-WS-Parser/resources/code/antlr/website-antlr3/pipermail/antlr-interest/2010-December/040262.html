<PRE>Hi, thanks for your reply.

Sorry if it wasn't clear, but the ordering does not matter.

The rule you proposed is basically what I had before, and as you say,
it allows any number of ps* keywords.

What I meant by &quot;rule combinations&quot; (not sure what else to call them)
is writing out all possible combinations.

(... psinitial=psinitialDecl ... finalstate=finalstateDecl? ...)
(... finalstate=finalstateDecl ... psinitial=psinitialDecl? ...), etc.

But maybe theres no elegant way of doing this. Maybe adding some
region scoped variables would be better, and setting hasInitial, etc,
and doing the check in the grammar.

Regards,
Morten

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why doesn't this work for you? &#160;There is an implied ordering here as in:
</I>&gt;<i> if finalstateDecl appears, it must be after the psinitialDecl, and
</I>&gt;<i> likewise for the rest. &#160;All stateDecls must appear after any
</I>&gt;<i> psinitialDecl, finalstateDecl, pshistoryDecl, psdeephistoryDecl, and
</I>&gt;<i> before any transitionsDecls, and all transitionDecls mus appear at the
</I>&gt;<i> end after everything else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From what I can see, the ()'s above are completely optional in your
</I>&gt;<i> grammar and only are provided for grouping, which in this case, to me,
</I>&gt;<i> seems unnecessary. &#160;Did I miss something?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And the only solution I have come up with, is to generate every
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible variant of this grammar, which is quite ugly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What would be nice, would be something like this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; : &#160; &#160; &#160; 'region' ID=Identifier? '{'

</I>&gt;<i> How about this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;: &#160; &#160; &#160; 'region' ID=identifier? '{'
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;(

</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;| &#160; &#160; &#160; psdeephistory=psdeephistoryDecl

</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;'}' ';'?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But this does not enforce the implied ordering of your first example,
</I>&gt;<i> and would allow any number of these to appear in any order.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You would also have to keep track of (deal with) whether
</I>&gt;<i> psinitial/finalstate/pshistory/psdeephistory appear more than once, and
</I>&gt;<i> make sure that your states and transitions collect properly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (with * at the end). And for every match to one of the zero-or-one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rule, it would take it &quot;away&quot;, so it can not be matched again. But
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this does not work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you move your ? &amp; * from inside the ()'s to outside, you will want to
</I>&gt;<i> remove them from the inside. &#160;You could do this, but it will not enforce
</I>&gt;<i> the implied ordering that I see in the first example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any suggestions on how to solve this? If I have to end up with every
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible rule combination, then I would probably be better of just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doing it in the semantic checker as I was doing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see any &quot;rule combinations&quot; since the original rule enforces and

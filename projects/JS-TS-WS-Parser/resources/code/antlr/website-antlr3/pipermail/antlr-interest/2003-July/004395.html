<PRE>&gt;<i> Let me fix the site...first patch has space in file name and this 
</I>one 
&gt;<i> comes in with C: on the top...
</I>
Hi Prof!,

I'm amazed you found time left to build a new website infrastructure 
seeing as you've launched a few businesses and taught the class in 
the same timeframe  ;-)

The site is a much needed improvement over the old (current?) site. 
As for the C# update files, Kunle removed the spaces second time 
around and that seemed to do the trick. I noticed you've already 
removed the duplicate entry. Thanks.

&gt;<i> I keep forgetting non-Unix computers exist ;)  Sorry about that.
</I>
No worries. I don't even know what a Unix is or what it eats... ;-)

&gt;<i> Let see, I guess I should disallow anything with a space and then 
</I>&gt;<i> remove all crap on the front of the filename so it's plain file.  
</I>&gt;<i> Weird.  On my system, just the filename appears not the whole 
</I>path.  I 
&gt;<i> guess each computer will send something different.  I'll have to 
</I>search 
&gt;<i> backwards for a ':' or a '/' I guess.
</I>
Sound like you'd be parsing something. May I recommend ANTLR?
 
&gt;<i> I'll patch up the descriptor / resource on my end so you don't have 
</I>to 
&gt;<i> reupload.
</I>
Cool. Thanks.

If you like, we'd be happy to do a C#/.NET version of the 
website/peerscope infrastructure. Actually Kunle would. Any plans for 
blogs on the site?  ;-)

Cheers,

Micheal

<PRE>Mike,

So, if you are suggesting that you have already fixed these other 
problems, I can see that both I and the wider community would love to 
have these patches. (In particular I am about to start moving nodes 
between trees...)

I have gotten Terence to add the new-and-improved Contribution (aka 
&quot;GitHub pull&quot;) process to both the FAQ and the V3 README... so I will 
now place one or more &quot;pull&quot; requests for my changes.

See:

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=33947666">http://www.antlr.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=33947666</A>

and in particular:

<A HREF="https://github.com/antlr/antlr3/blob/master/contributors.txt">https://github.com/antlr/antlr3/blob/master/contributors.txt</A>

However I am not sure I could shepherd your changes through this 
process... item (3) of the contributor's agreement means that I would 
have to take full responsibility for any IPR issues created by your 
patches.... which, sight-un-seen, could be nasty....

SO

It would be much better if you forked antlr/antlr3 on GitHub, added your 
changes, and then issued a pull request.  GitHub is really very easy to 
use (if you already know git).

If this is a great problem, let me know.

Regards,

Stephen Gaito

</I>&gt;<i> You fixed the parent return problem in the common tree already, but there's still the issue with not-set parents when moving nodes between trees (antlr3basetree.c) and then I also removed the declaration of &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; from antlr3convertutf.h and replaced their occurrences in antlr3convertutf.c (as they caused warnings about duplicate declarations). Additionally, I renamed the member PROTOCOL_VERSION in antlr3debugeventlistener.h to lower case, as it conflicted with a macro of the same name (member names should never be written all upper case anyway). Finally I added a number of casts to get rid of compiler warnings.

</I>&gt;<i> So what is now the most up to date C runtime? The one from you on Github? I can make a diff and send it to you if you want.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Btw: the runtime on antlr.org still has 3.0.1 as version number in the README, even for the 3.4 download. The same holds true for your Git repo.

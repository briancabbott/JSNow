&gt;&gt;<i> IMNSHO, the dynamic attributes support is a fundamental feature of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Antlr v3.
</I>
&gt;<i> Well, maybe.  It is a feature that has not yet been put to experimental
</I>&gt;<i> test.  It might turn out to be extremely valuable, or it might be just
</I>&gt;<i> another bit of glitz.
</I>
It's more than just glitz.

Coming from a language designer's perspective, dynamically scoped
attributes fill a capability niche that is not provided for by any of the
statically scope capabilities.

In terms of praxis, look at how many times people have written their own
(buggy :-) version of dynamic attributes.  Heck, I've done it a handful of
times myself on different translation projects.


&gt;<i> Also, while Hashmaps might be required by ANTLR to support dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> attributes, that does not mean that they should be present in the
</I>&gt;<i> generated code.  Generating attribute classes or structures should be
</I>&gt;<i> pretty straightforward, and the runtime attribute containers should
</I>&gt;<i> probably be implemented as fields in the generated lexers, parsers, and
</I>&gt;<i> treewalkers so that they are accessible within rules.  That would
</I>&gt;<i> certainly help to ensure that analysis passes (most of the work done in
</I>&gt;<i> actions) can have good performance.  And the ANTLR 3 output templates
</I>&gt;<i> should make the code generation even easier.
</I>
Again, in terms of implementation, I'm extremely open to allowing the
different code generators &amp; runtime combinations to do whatever they want
as long as they provide all of the capabilities.

As I noted for the notes from the workshop, the dynamically scoped
attributes need to support cabilities for things like LIFO &amp; FIFO access;
specification of things like at most one/n, exactly one/n, at least one/n;
pushing/popping bundles of attributes; search current scope for attribute,
search up stack for attribute; etc.

Take care,
	John

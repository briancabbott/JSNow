<PRE>Prashant:
 
This may not be the kind of feedback you were looking for, so take it for
whatever it's worth.
 
I'm a Windows, C++ guy. I spend most of my life inside Visual Studio, and I
don't know anything about Java or Eclipse. I have plenty of C++ work and
precious little spare time, so I really have no desire to tinker with Java
or Eclipse. It's hard enough to find time to cut the grass.
 
I go to your web site in anticipation of downloading an IDE for Antlr. Nice
screen shots, looks really interesting. .But nowhere does it say that this
is a plug-in for some other IDE, at least nowhere that was obvious to me. I
eventually figure that out and do a Google search for Eclipse. Now I'm faced
with a large array of things to download. Do I just need the Eclipse SDK, or
do I need any of the other stuff?
 
Then I notice that you need Java to run Eclipse. Great. Now I'm faced with
the prospect of downloading three things from three different sources,
hoping I choose the right downloads and that I install them in the proper
order, and hoping that they'll all play nice and work together.  And more
important, I have to hope that installing all this stuff doesn't somehow
hose up my development machine.
 
Faced with the prospect of wasting many hours trying to get all of this to
work vs., getting back to the mountain of work I have to do, I close my
browser and get back to work.
 
Now, I realize that your target audience is probably Java people and
installing Java and Eclipse might be as simple to you guys as installing
Visual Studio is to me.  If there was some assurance that this stuff is
fairly painless to install and get running, I'd take a look at Antlr Studio
and most likely, purchase a copy, as long as it can work with Antlr's C++
generated parsers. No interest in creating or debugging Java-based parsers.
C# would be a plus, but C++ is a must.
 
I looked for some hand-holding article on your web site, but didn't find
anything at all that would help a Java/Eclipse-challenged programmer such as
myself. Maybe most of the people in the Antlr world are Java people, so I
realize that this might not be worth your time. 
 
My 2 cents, hope its useful.
 
Don

I forgot to mention that you will need-
Eclipse 3.1 or higher
Java 5 or higher
to install Antlr Studio.

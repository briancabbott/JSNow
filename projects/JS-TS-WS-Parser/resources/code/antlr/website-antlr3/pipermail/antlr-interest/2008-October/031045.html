</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, of course I have the source code. How else could I generate

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; etc. Always look here before posting, you can save a lot of time

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jeez. If I knew what to look for I wouldn't have to ask.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Err, taking issue with me telling you where the source code tree
</I>&gt;<i> browser is (and giving you the links to the doxygen config file)
</I>
Though in fact you did not give me &quot;... the links to the doxygen config 
file,&quot; only a pointer to the large set of files in which it might be 
found. And you did this even though it was clear from my earlier 
postings in this thread that I had the source code already. You 
could &quot;... save a lot of time for everyone ...&quot; by paying attention to 
the threads to which you're posting.


&gt;<i> is a bit rich don't you think? How could you NOT know what to look
</I>&gt;<i> for if you know how to run doxygen?
</I>
Doxygen makes no demands on the name of the config file, so one really 
has nothing to go on a priori in seeking it within a source 
distribution of, as is the case with ANTLR 3.1.1, 89 directories and 
802 files.


&gt;<i> Don't worry though, I won't make the mistake of offending you again by
</I>&gt;<i> trying to help. 
</I>
By using the word &quot;jeez&quot; to express mild exasperation you conclude I'm 
offended?

Nonetheless, I feel I will survive without your insights. You may feel 
free to put me in your killfile. I will sleep soundly even if you do.

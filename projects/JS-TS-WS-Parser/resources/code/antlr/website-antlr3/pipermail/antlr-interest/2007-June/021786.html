<PRE>I see. This makes sense. So what do you think of doing the following?
The DFA ANTLR generates is difficult to decipher in this case, but it
should work according to your theory? If I let LP_OTHER emit two tokens,
it should be fine?

ID : ('a'..'z')+;
 

fragment WS : ' ' | '\t' ;

LPAREN    : '(' ;

LP_SELECT : '(' WS* 'select';

LP_OTHER:	'(' WS* ID;	 
	

prog: (ID|LP_OTHER|LP_SELECT|WS)+ ;

more powerful than backtracking. However this seems to be a case where
the LL(*) algorithm falls over.
If you look at the generated code you can see there is an mTokens rule
with a comment &quot;// T.g:1:10: ( ID | LPAREN | LP_SELECT )&quot;. So ANTLR is
effectively generating a lexer for the grammar:

MTOKENS
	:	ID | LPAREN | LP_SELECT
	;

fragment
ID : ('a'..'z')+;

fragment
LPAREN : '(';

fragment
LP_SELECT : LPAREN 'select';

For this grammar, ANTLR generates a correct lexer. MTOKENS can only
return one of ID, LPAREN and LP_SELECT, so once it has seen the '('
ANTLR only needs to look at the 's' to decide which rule to follow,
given the 's' MOTKENS must match LP_SELECT or give an error as matching
LPAREN LP_SELECT is not an option.
However, don't you really want MTOKENS to be:
MTOKENS
	:	(ID | LPAREN | LP_SELECT)+
	;
A lexer does return multiple tokens. Using this rule, ANTLR correctly
checks for the entire 'select' string before deciding to go with
LP_SELECT.
This seems like a bug in ANTLR to me.

Tom.

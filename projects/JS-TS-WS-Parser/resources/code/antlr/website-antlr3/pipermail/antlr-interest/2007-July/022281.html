Might I suggest that in many of these cases, you could make more 
progress and learn more effectively by availing yourself of the 
considerable powers of ANTLRWorks.

ANTLRWorks' debugger can run your parser on test input (going so far as 
to provide single-stepping and even reverse-stepping to earlier stages 
in the parse) and can show either the parse tree or the AST of a 
tree-generating or rewriting parser. It is an outstanding tool for 
understanding the consequences of various grammar and / or rewrite 
choices.

If you haven't already done so, check it out! If you have, perhaps you 
could give us some idea why it isn't at least as good as a mailing list 
at answering many of the questions that arise as you develop your 
parser.

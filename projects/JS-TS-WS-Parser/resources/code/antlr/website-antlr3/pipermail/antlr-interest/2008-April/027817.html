<PRE> 
Thanks for the pointers. I think I have enough info to bury my head in
the manual for a while.

&gt;<i> &gt; P.S. I am loving all the comments about &quot;XML not being meant for
</I>human 
&gt;<i> &gt; consumption&quot;...
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure if all people here agree here, but at least Ter does.
</I>
I think I have come across at least 2 such comments.
Even that makes me feel better and more sane. ;-)
As sane as Ter maybe, anyway...  (Hello if you are reading Ter)
I very much like the cut of Ter's jib.
The single-mindedness behind ANTLR is impressive and inspiring.

ANTLRWorks is impressive too.

Cheers.

As the best bet is to correlate lines and not the characters in a
particular line, it seems to be easier to add the line information in an
extra XML element (even it is a comment &lt;!-- --&gt;). Thus you can simplify
the parser and are more flexible in the way, how you output the XML.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If I just want to write a fairly simple converter, and keep

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fairly intact, how 'dirty' do I have to get my hands, language

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and code wise?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To clarify, I want to convert a proprietary format into equivalent

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Something like &quot;x [ a b c ]&quot;   -&gt;  &quot;&lt;rule name=x&gt; &lt;one-of&gt; a b c 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;/one-of&gt; &lt;/rule&gt;&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (But obviously, it gets a little more complicated than that)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please don't use this kind of XML. It is possible to create a schema 
</I>&gt;<i> which says that an element includes a whitespace separated list, but 
</I>&gt;<i> everyone agrees that it is simpler to work with:

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/one-of&gt; &lt;/rule&gt;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> More verbose yes, but XML wasn't designed with terseness in mind.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My 2 biggest questions:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Do I need to worry about 'building trees', accessing the AST or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anything like that? Or are the 'snippets' of code you can put in the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to put out the parse tree in the same shape as it is and 
</I>&gt;<i> with no extra computation, then I doubt that a tree grammar is 
</I>&gt;<i> necessary for you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Is maintaining whitespace easily do-able? It seems to get gobbled 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up with little opportunity to keep it intact. It seems I could maybe 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tokenize it explicitly as meaningful input, and then be able to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simply
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> re-constitute it in the output, or is that just crazy talk and will 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complicate my grammars too much (with 'WS?' sprinkled everywhere...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you need to retain th whitespace for? XML ignores big parts of
</I>
&gt;<i> it anyway and with a new file format you don't have to follow the 
</I>&gt;<i> conventions laid down by your predecessors. Better to ignore the 
</I>&gt;<i> original whitespace here.

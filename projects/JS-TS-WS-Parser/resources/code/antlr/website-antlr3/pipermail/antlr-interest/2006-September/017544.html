<PRE>I don't think that &quot;lex everything twice&quot; as Ter suggests is a good solution.  It does work--that's what a preprocessor does--but additional overhead is added to cover mapping positions (file and line directives).

I think that the better approach is to recognize &quot;import foo&quot; (or whatever) as a token in the lexer.  That works reasonably well with ANTLR 2 but may not work in ANTLR 3 yet (due to synpred problems).  Your lexer rule would look something like:

TEXT
    :
    (IMPORT)=&gt; IMPORT
    |
    &lt;standard TEXT def'n&gt;
    ;

IMPORT
    :
    'i' &quot;mport&quot; &lt;recognize rest of text, execute import actions, mark token as &quot;SKIP&quot;&gt;
    ;

(Separating the 'i' in &quot;import&quot; effectively means that the synpred is only invoked when there is a leading 'i'.)

you will need to handle lexical instructions inside the input stream
(you can have several different kinds of &quot;include&quot; statements in
several languages - include, copy, -inc, ...) and we can have same
more sofisticates include statements (like an ASP file that is not
just a statement is a tag).
And the second problem that I can see with this solution is to control
file positions (line and column position) because you will need to add
one more internal thing : fileName (to get info about what is the
active file name).
I&#180;d like to know your opinion about this.

&gt;<i> hi. for includes, I'd probably just make my input character stream

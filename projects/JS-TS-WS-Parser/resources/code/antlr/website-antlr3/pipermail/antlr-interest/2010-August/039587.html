<PRE>I'm on vs2008 for antlr work, so I cannot claim authority but I do deal with mixed libs every day between multiple releases of vs.  Jim Idle knows his code of course.  So your vs2005 code will link fine with antlr built with vs2008 but the former and latter each use their respective versions of the C runtime.  So you need both C runtimes and they do coexist peacefully.  You'll need to get a copy of the vs20008 c runtime.

I hope that helps.

Hi,

  In both case antlr C runtime library will be compiled by Visual studio 2005. 
But previously Jim idle told that &#8220;The issue is that the vs2005 compiler does 
not support a few ANSI constructs used in the runtime. This means that you must 
compile the runtime in 2008 and just link with it in your 2005 project. But 
unless you configure the include paths for you project and so on, then it will 
not compile anyway. That's why I am telling you to download&quot; So is there any 
workaround for this. Thanks for your time and patience

Thanks,
Jrk

I believe you have two options.  You might prefer to recompile the antlr runtime 
DLL with vs2005 If your goal is minimizing dependencies.  Alternatively you 
could just drop the  redistributable C runtime from vs2008 into your packaging.  
Unfortunately there's quite a bit of confusion on this point specific to msvcr9 
due to some unclear release communications.  But if you use the runtime redist 
kit which actually ships with vs2008 you should be ok.  You may be able to get 
the redist from the express edition of vs2008 but you'll have to check that.

Good luck!

Hi,

   My entire project is done in VS2005 which will create dll and later I will 
use those dll. I am creating the parser using ANTLR and those file I am planned 
to add it as a function in my project which is in VS2005. When I compiled ANTLR 
generated file seperatly in VS2005 I don't have any problem. Even when I 
combined and built with my project, it is fine. But when my dll calls 
antlr3cd.dll which in turn it callsMSVCR90D.dll. It looks that dll is VS2008 
dll. Any suggestion how to get rid of this.

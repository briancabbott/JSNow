Howdy :)

This is not possible in theory for k&gt;1 because each lookahead set is 
O(|T|^k) in the worst case.  In practice it's not as bad, but can 
quickly explode for k&gt;2.  The algorithm is irrelevant...this is min 
requirement just to store a *single* lookahead set.

</I>
Actually, it can never be polynomial in theory.  The sequence of tokens 
is combinatoric.  Sometimes in practice you can make it do k=7 as I've 
done with antlr on small grammars.

&gt;<i>  So SLK begins to create a table assuming
</I>&gt;<i> the grammar is SLL(1). If it detects an ambiguity it augments it with
</I>&gt;<i> SLL(2), etc. How does ANTLR do it?
</I>
ANTLR does the same thing and that technique has been known for at 
least 30 years (modulating the lookahead depth).

&gt;&gt;<i> Again, PCCTS does full LALL(k); my

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but isn't the creation time for such a parser exponential in
</I>&gt;<i> respect to k?
</I>
Yep.  Any parser that does SLL or LALL or LL will be exponential for 
k&gt;1.  LL is non linear (can't remember exact order at the moment) even 
for k=1 due to rule replication.

Approximate parsers are always non-exponential, but non linear.  They 
are essentially O(|G|xk) or perhaps a little higher where |G| is the 
size of the grammar.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a : A;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> t : X a A ;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, this is interesting. *Obviously this shows LALL' grammars are not a
</I>&gt;<i> subset of SLL grammars*!
</I>
Correct.  SLL has less precise lookahead computation.

However, I made a mistake in this grammar I just realized...tried to 
simplify.  Here is an LALL(1) grammar that should not be SLL(k).

s : (a|C) B ;

a : A|;

t : a C ;

The problem is that computing lookahead for first alt of subrule you go 
like this:

LOOK(a) == FIRST(a) == {A} U FOLLOW(a)  == A // SLL

whereas an LALL computation will use the fact that it knows which 
context in which 'a' will be invoked and use only the first 
FOLLOW=={B}.  So LALL(1) should compute {A,B} for lookahead of first 
alt of subrule and SLL(1) would compute {A,B,C}, which collides with C 
of second alt.  Sorry for the incorrect grammar.  BTW, LALL'(1) == 
LALL(1) grammar and language.  They are identical functionally and 
hence equivalent in power trivially.

&gt;<i> What about languages then?
</I>
Ah.  That's different.

&gt;<i>  As far as I understand from the above there
</I>&gt;<i> is always a way to rephrase your LL grammar to SLL to parse any LL
</I>&gt;<i> language, is this correct?
</I>
For k=1, SLL(k)==LL(k).  But this is not true for LL(k) languages with 
k&gt;1.

&gt;<i>  Is it always possible to make a LL grammar
</I>&gt;<i> LALL', parsing the same language?
</I>
I'm not certain, but I'd say no: there must be LL(k) languages that are 
not LALL'(k).

&gt;<i>  If not the LALL' languages indeed seem
</I>&gt;<i> to be a subset of the SLL languages, right?
</I>
No because LL(k) strictly stronger than SLL(k) languages and grammars.  
LALL' weaker than LALL for grammars, but I don't know for languages.  I 
never established that result, sorry.  Therefore, I don't think the 
relationship is so obvious.  The only thing that is clear is that SLK's 
claims about being strongest non-LL(k) parsers is wrong due to PCCTS's 
LALL(k) parsers.

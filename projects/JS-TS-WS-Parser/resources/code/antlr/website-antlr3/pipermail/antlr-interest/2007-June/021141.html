Hi gang. Actually, I'm a bit busy with USF stuff and my dad just died  
so I'm trying to clean up his finances etc...

I'm off to Australia next week (with laptop) to hang out with the  
cenqua.com (clover, fisheye) guys and give a lecture or two.  Trying  
to finish up stuff.

That said, I *did* forget about this one...sorry.

Ter

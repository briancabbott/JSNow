Message-ID: <bt22cq+dhmm@eGroups.com>

Hi,

It seems it is not possible to nest anonymous templates in the 
StringTemplate library, e.g.

$A:{$attr:{$attr.B$}$}$

Is this in fact true? If so, is there a conceptual reason why this is 
not supported? It seems reasonably straightforward to implement and I 
thought I should check before I rush off and implement something that 
is already supported or, even worse, not conceptually sound.

:-)

Howdy :) Hmm...Yeah, I think somebody else found this too...yep, found 
this in my bugs list:

* Matthew Ford: Support nested anon templates or return better error.

Sorry about that...no conceptual reason, just a very bad scanner (which 
I do by hand since the delimiters are unrestricted).  Actually, it 
might be in the stringtemplate action lexer itself not the thing that 
chunk up the template.

Sure, send in a patch if you want :)  Matthew will thank you too...

Thanks for your interest...

Hi,

I have to admit my interest isn't purely altruistic. I really would 
like to be able to nest anonymous templates. I just figured it would 
be unfair to ask someone to implement my requirement without at least 
giving it a bash myself. ;)

I have a patch available which I'd be happy to email to anybody who's 
interested. It's for the C# port only unfortunately. I haven't had 
time to apply it to the Java version. It isn't a big change so it 
should be easy to port from C# to Java. Specifically:

1. Changed lexer in action.g to recognize nested anonymous templates
2. Changed lexer in action.g to recognize \r as whitespace 
3. Changed scarfing in parseAttributeExpressionChunk in 
StringTemplate.cs to recognize nested anonymous templates

The code isn't the prettiest, but it seems to work more or less.
Caveat Emptor. :)

Great!  Thanks...i'll poke around a bit and see if I can't change the 
"master".  After Matthew Ford's recommendations, I've got lots of fixes 
for a new release that make it much easier to override behavior and 
such.

Howdy folks,

Please take a look at the 2.7.3 release candidate to see if it works 
with your grammar:

I will a week or two until people have played with the release to see 
if I've made any stupid mistakes ;)

It does not work for my grammar which requires the "Custom AST Types" patch 
from:
         http://www.trump.net.au/~rjc/antlr/

otherwise i get a class cast exception as ASTNULL tries to get cast into 
the custom AST type in the tree walker.

Also i looked last part of the java 1.1 patch(PreservingFileWriter.java) 
still needs to be applied from the above link to get it working with java 
1.1 (not sure if you still care about 1.1 compatibility).

Subject: [antlr-interest] importVocab exportVocab problem
Message-ID: <bt6h5g+cg1o@eGroups.com>

Hello,

I am having trouble defining a vocabulary in one file and the
importing it into my Parser.  I have read the documentation and
everything I can find in the newgroup, plus have gone through the
TinyBasic example and I am still getting errors.  Sorry, this seems
like it should be easy.

I started by defining a lexer and parser in the same file.  When I did
this, my example ran.  I then created another grammar file, moved my
lexer to this file, added an exportVocab option.  In the original
file, I deleted the lexer and added an importVocab option to the
parser.  Compiling the lexer first and then the parser, I see the
tokens are generated in the ParserTokensTypes.txt, but I get the
following error:

line 1:1: expecting "MIKE.START", found 'MIKE.START'

Here is the Lexer:
class mikeLexer extends Lexer;

options {
	testLiterals=true;
	exportVocab=mike;
}

protected
DIGIT : ('0'..'9') ;

protected
DOT : '.' ;

protected
INTEGER : (DIGIT)+ ;


protected
DECIMAL : (DIGIT)*  DOT (DIGIT)+ ;

NUMBER : 	((DIGIT)* DOT)=> (DIGIT)* DOT (DIGIT)+ 
				{$setType(DECIMAL);} 
			| (DIGIT)+ 
				{$setType(INTEGER);}
		;

protected
LETTER : 'A'..'Z';

TAG : (LETTER | DOT)+ ;		


WS	:	(	' '
		|	'\t'
		|	'\f' 
		|	(	options {generateAmbigWarnings=false;}
			:	"\r\n"  // DOS
			|	'\r'    // Macintosh
			|	'\n'	// Unix
			)
			{newline();}
		)+

    // now the overall whitespace action -- skip it!
    { $setType(Token.SKIP); }
    ;

Here is the parser:
class P extends Parser;

options {
	k=2;
	importVocab=mike;
}

startRule	:	"MIKE.START"
				INTEGER
				"END.MIKE"
    ;


Here is the input file:
MIKE.START
100
END.MIKE

My goal is be able to share this Vocabulary with multiple Parsers, at
times extending the tokens.  What am I missing? Thanks for your time.

Mike Wall

are you running antlr on the lexer first (the output vocab) and then on 
the grammar (that uses the exported vocab)?

oops.  Ric must have forgotten to put into main line...Anyway, it's

Subject: [antlr-interest] I misclassified ANTLR as LALL
Message-ID: <48475514-3E29-11D8-B1FC-000A95891192@cs.usfca.edu>

Folks,

After communicating with the inventors of the LALL class of grammars, I 
have an example grammar that is LALL but not SLL.  Furthermore, ANTLR 
does not accept it so ANTLR cannot handle the LALL class directly.  To 
set the record straight then:

PCCTS: SLL(k) + sem and syn preds with hoisting of sem preds
ANTLR 2.x: SLL_1(k) + sem and syn preds
ANTLR 3: SLL-regular(k) + sem and syn preds with hoisting of sem preds

Sorry for the confusion.

Terence

Hi Luis,

I have also made these changes in the Java version and added tests for 
char escaping...fixed some stuff concerning that.

Thanks for the reply,

Yes, I think so.  I cleared out all generated java and txt files, ran
antlr.Tool on the lexer and then on the parser which contains the
grammar.  Seems like it should work, and it looks like the grammar is
importing the vocab correctly.  I there something in the way antlr
uses a lexer and a parser in the same file that I need to do when I
break them into separate files?  I appreciate the reply.

Mike

I assume C# folks are on vacation still, though I thought they had 
everything in.  Let's wait to hear from them. :)  I need their change

hmm...yep, looks like a literals issue.  YOu define a literal in the 
parser, but it cannot be fed back into the lexer when the lexer exports 
the vocab.  It returns as TAG not "MIKE.START".  Define the literals in 
the lexer I'd say and then you can use in the parser. :)

Hi,

Yeah. I also fixed some char escaping stuff. :)

Is anybody officially maintaining the C# port?
If not, I'll see if I can incorporate your fixes
for the new release into the C# port.

I'm contemplating going from grammar to an intermediate text format 
language and then going back to a tree.  May not be worth it, but

Do you have any pointers to papers on SLL-regular or is this your invention?

No unicode changes in this version of antlr. Had planned to do some stuff
on a new C++ runtime in the holidays but did not get to it. Also looks like
I have to do a lot more research into unicode to do it right, and this
makes unicode support in the near future a lot less certain since it
requires a *lot* of work I don't need myself.

Did you use --enable-gcj for configure ? If not it looks like make has
gotten very confused. The gcj build is a bit experimental it behaves badly
on several platforms (although this is the first problem with the makefile
I've seen if that's the case). Try building without gcj for starters.

Could it be that there's some issue with unix/dos newlines in the Makefile,
Config.make, Rules.make (or their .in versions) ?

You are running a somewhat recent GNU make ? (personally I use 3.79.1)

Configure parameters and output could be helpfull.

Cheers,

Ric

SLK author is correct: LL(1) == SLL(1) grammar and language.  Supported 
by all theory books I checked upon return from vacation.

Correct.  I don't have the grammar handy that shows ANTLR is not LALL.

I pretty sure we'll all agree on the above. :)

Subject: [antlr-interest] Custom AST?  How to write a compiler?
Message-ID: <btcf2r+p1gr@eGroups.com>

Hi,
Are there any hidden issues that complicate using Custom AST's in C++
mode?

Is the "Custom AST Types" patch still required on newer releases (say
2.7.3 from Ric) of Antlr?

Okay, now the BIG question.  I trying to utilize Antlr to construct a
'C' compiler, the final output of which would be P code (for a stack
machine lets say).  Would Custom AST's derived from Antlr's be
suitable for this, or should I discard it all in favor of creating and
manipulating my own AST's?

I have read much of Ian's comments, and some past list comments on
this, but am still undecided.  Incidently, the compiler does not have
to be particularly fast or produce optimal code (has to be correct
though).  I just need to be able to complete it in the forseeable
future ;)

Thanks,

Henry

I'll do it...sorry about that.   They are generated files so I figured

Henry--

There will be an ANTLR 2.8e0 ("e" for "experimental" in preparation
for 3.0) release candidate out "soon".  I have some more work to do,
particularly on documentation, but it will include
target-language-independent tree rewrite support and automated tree
grammar generation.  My guess is that we can get a release candidate
out soon after 2.7.3 gets to final release--possibly early February. 
Manually creating your own trees works, but it gets messy in large
grammars (I've been creating Python parse trees in an ANTLR tree
grammar, so I have some recent experience).  I'd advise using ANTLR
tree generation rather than creating custom trees in actions.

Hmmm looks like something changed with make 3.80 then I'll look into it.

Might be a few small things like some extra casts needed here and there.
Between 2.7.2 and 2.7.3 there's some small changes in a few API's which
were necessary to get things to work with modern gcc/vc++. The
functionality itself works very well use it myself every day.

Heterogeneous AST's should work, but you'll run into trouble sooner or
later somewhere (a little bit depending on the complexity of what you're
doing) nothing that's not fixable but you might have to dig a bit deeper
somewhere to make things work (explicit casts from one type to another this
due to the reference counting).

I'm not aware of such a patch. Should not be necessary.

ANTLR AST's would work I guess (custom ones too) it depends a bit on how
you structure the AST. You might have a few tree rewriting passes to
massage things into something that is easy to translate.

Arguments against using ANTLR's AST's might be some of the ones of Ian
(it's a while back since I read his pages but he has some sane remarks
about them), it is sometimes a pain to get exactly what you want with the
current syntax. But usually after some fiddling around and tree dumping
it's not that hard to get right. It is also somewhat annoying to have the
antlr stuff bleed through to deep into your backend (mostly for error
handling/feedback purpose) but this is I guess a matter of taste.

For my own project I would not move to own make AST's anymore. Even if I
would have to make it from scratch again I would stick to ANTLR's.

Generating P-code from something C-ish would not be that hard. Have done
something similar for compiler construction classes during my study with a
LL(1) generator so things only would be easier with antlr ;)

Message-ID: <20040107165441.77561.qmail@web40603.mail.yahoo.com>


It seems that antlr uses exceptions in a lot of the generated parsers where simple test will do. 
Everything that I have read is that an exceptions have a very high overhead and it is undesirable 
to  generate them in a tight loop where they happen a lot. 

Exceptions are used so extensivly it would require a big rewrite to change but I wanted to 
raise it as an issue

A very common piece of code in a parser is 

try {
  {
    match( SYM1 );
    match( SYM2 );
    match( SYM3 );
 }
} catch (RecognitionException)	{
  synPredMatched84 = false;
}

where match throws an exception if the next token is not the parameter. 
Since match is just
public virtual void  match(int t)
{
    if (LA(1) != t)
	throw new MismatchedTokenException(tokenNames, LT(1), t, false, getFilename());
    else
	consume();
}


Using if based tests would be faster I think...

Something like this

bool Rule10() { 
  if( !Rule22() ) goto 	_RecognitionException_123:

  currentSym = SYM1; if ( LA( 1 ) != currentSym ) goto _RecognitionException_123; consume(); 
  currentSym = SYM2; if ( LA( 1 ) != currentSym ) goto _RecognitionException_123; consume(); 
  currentSym = SYM3; if ( LA( 1 ) != currentSym ) goto _RecognitionException_123; consume(); 
    
  return true; 

  _RecognitionException_123:
    if (0 == inputState.guessing)
    {
      reportError(currentSym);
      consume();
      consumeUntil(tokenSet_27_);

      return true;  //attempt to recover in the calling rule
    }
    else //guessing
    {
	return false; 
    }
  }

I probably missed some the the code paths with predicate guessing and error handling but 
I still think you can get the same behavior as the exception with a combination of if, goto and
storing information into stack.   

And get a performance improvement....

There are other sources of exceptions which you would need to analyze the
code before knowing you could use goto.  For instance rules can have initial
actions, which are executed during syn preds and which could potentially
throw exceptions.  And when lookahead conditions aren't met we throw an
exception because remember the same code is used during syn preds and when
not in a syn pred.  So you would need a hook into the user exception
handling stuff so it would be handled a different way if you aren't
exceptioning out.

And of course you can't do this for java because of the lack of goto.  Maybe
you could get away with labeled breaks and continues, I haven't thought it
through yet.

This will be easier to experiment with in antlr 3 because writing code
generators will be template driven.

It seems that antlr uses exceptions in a lot of the generated parsers where
simple test will do. 
Everything that I have read is that an exceptions have a very high overhead
and it is undesirable 
to  generate them in a tight loop where they happen a lot. 

Exceptions are used so extensivly it would require a big rewrite to change
but I wanted to 
raise it as an issue

A very common piece of code in a parser is 

try {
  {
    match( SYM1 );
    match( SYM2 );
    match( SYM3 );
 }
} catch (RecognitionException)	{
  synPredMatched84 = false;
}

where match throws an exception if the next token is not the parameter. 
Since match is just
public virtual void  match(int t)
{
    if (LA(1) != t)
	throw new MismatchedTokenException(tokenNames, LT(1), t, false,
getFilename());
    else
	consume();
}


Using if based tests would be faster I think...

Something like this

bool Rule10() { 
  if( !Rule22() ) goto 	_RecognitionException_123:

  currentSym = SYM1; if ( LA( 1 ) != currentSym ) goto
_RecognitionException_123; consume(); 
  currentSym = SYM2; if ( LA( 1 ) != currentSym ) goto
_RecognitionException_123; consume(); 
  currentSym = SYM3; if ( LA( 1 ) != currentSym ) goto
_RecognitionException_123; consume(); 
    
  return true; 

  _RecognitionException_123:
    if (0 == inputState.guessing)
    {
      reportError(currentSym);
      consume();
      consumeUntil(tokenSet_27_);

      return true;  //attempt to recover in the calling rule
    }
    else //guessing
    {
	return false; 
    }
  }

I probably missed some the the code paths with predicate guessing and error
handling but 
I still think you can get the same behavior as the exception with a
combination of if, goto and
storing information into stack.   

And get a performance improvement....

You are right, yet the whole ANTLR 2 codegeneration is based around this
(in a sense it's a easy way to deal with some of the errors and with the
backtracking). Also makes ports to languages without exception handling
awkward. Another thing is that it increases codesize for C++ (need RTTI)
embedded software folks would probably love to have that turned off.

It's been raised before. Maybe it can be addressed in ANTLR 3 since the
whole codegen gets an overhaul then.

That one is particularly ugly indeed. Yet it allows to do some tricks via
overloading of match. Bit of a tradeoff between extendability and
performance.

Hi gang, my only additional comment would be that using return values 
makes it pretty hard to have other return values from a rule, which are 
arguably very handy.

Note that antlr does a simple static k lookahead test before resorting 
to backtracking in the generated parser.

Further, the use of boatloads of syn preds is not usually necessary and 
are used as a crutch too often.  At least they are there though ;)

I agree.   sigh. It would be a major rewrite and could only be done on a big version change. 

The biggest impact would be to the way antlr does predicate checking 
and user errors. 

But I still think it would be a big performance win. 

No gotos in java, thats do-able.   

Instead of every code block being a try{}catch 
you could do most things with break and returning a result stucture. 
Null result is success.

At the end of every block check result is null to coninue. 

   struct ResultInfo ; //ErrorInfo is a struct that can hold the 
                           //info we are putting into the exception currently


Have match and rules return errorinfo structs on error, null on success. 

ErrorInfo Match( Symbol t ) { 
      if ( LA( 1 ) != t ) 
            return new ResultInfo( t, linenumber, etc); 

      consume(); 
      return null; //success
}


ResultInfo Rule1() { 

    ResultInfo  result=null; //null until sucess
   //stuff

   for(;;){ // inside some block


       for(;;) { 
          if( (result = Rule2()) != null  } break;

          if( (result = Match( SYM123 ) ) != null  } break;
       }
       if( result != null ) break;  //put this after every single code block
                                    // will break to the top level
                                    // a poor man's goto
                                    // still cheaper then a catch even if nested deep
   } 
   if( result != null ) break;  //etc.

   //stuff

    if( result != null ) { 
     //handle result  

    } 
    return result;    
}

Subject: [antlr-interest] Java Cross Referencing Tool (Alpha Release)
Message-ID: <3AC103F1B7EEEC48A855ACB1D2819E9102431076@rock-corpmail.microfocus.com>

To download the zip file, go to
 
http://www.antlr.org/share/list <http://www.antlr.org/share/list> 
 
Introduction
This is the alpha release of the Java Cross Reference Tool (uses ANTLR
2.7.2).  It is based on Terence's tool in the file sharing section.  To
review its roots you can take a look at www.antlr.org/share/list
<http://www.antlr.org/share/list> .  There have been many improvements and
additions.  The goal is to have another release in the future that improves
the code and streamlines the "get up and running" process.  There might be a
few bug fixes, as well. :0) 
 
Overview
Input: *.java files, jar files, or a directory structure
 
Output:  An XML document with a hierarchical representation of packages,
classes and references.  The MyOutput class regulates the output location of
the XML file.  The name is controlled in the CodeProject class (currently
"null").  MyOutput has methods to control output when references are
resolved.
 
Installation and execution
 
 The process will be streamlined.  The manual installation forces the user
to become familiar necessary configuration steps that could be overlooked.  
Assumptions: Java JDK and Antlr 2.7.2 is installed.  An older java.g 1.3 is
used.  Recent patches have not been integrated.
 
1.	Download JavaCrossRef.zip 
 
2.	Unzip to c:\  (this will create the c:\antlr.xref directory
structure) 
 
3.	cd to the c:\antlr.xref\src\org\antlr\java\crossref subdirectory 
 
4.	To generate the necessary files run the following commands (My path
includes "c:\j2sdk1.4.2_01\bin"; and my full classpath is
".;c:\antlr-2.7.2\antlr.jar") 
A.      java antlr.Tool java.g
a.       Creates JavaRecognizer.java, JavaLexer.java, JavaTokenTypes.java
and JavaTokenTypes.txt
B.      java antlr.Tool javatree.g
a.       Creates JavaTreeParser.java, JavaTreeParserTokenTypes.java and
JavaTreeParserTokenTypes.txt
C.      java antlr.Tool -glib javaTree.g defs.g 
a.       Creates JavaDefsTreeParser.java, JavaTreeDefsParserTokenTypes.java
and JavaTreeDefsParserTokenTypes.txt
b.       Warnings will result for rule JavaDefsTreeParser.packageDefinition
and Rule 'identifier' returning a value
D.      java antlr.Tool -glib javaTree.g prerefs.g
a.       Creates JavaPreRefsTreeParser.java,
JavaTreePreRefsParserTokenTypes.java and JavaTreePreRefsParserTokenTypes.txt
b.       Warnings result for packageDefinition, typeSpec, typeSpecArray,
type, extendsClasue, implementsClause, parameterDef, variableDeclarator,
methodHead, identifier, newExpression and
'identifier'-'parameterDef'-'typeSpecArray'-'typeSpec'-newExpression'
returns a value
E.      java antlr.Tool -glib javaTree.g refs.g
a.       Creates JavaRefsTreeParser.java, JavaTreeRefsParserTokenTypes.java
and JavaTreeRefsParserTokenTypes.txt
b.       Lots more warning messages
 
5.	Before compiling the files you should edit a few of the files to
control the output 
A.      In CodeProject.java, a few fields are "user configurable" and can be
modified
a.       protected String name = null; null can be changed to name the
current project.  Otherwise the xml file will get the name "null.xml".
b.       static final boolean saveReferences = true;  when set to "true" all
references are saved to the CodeProject hierarchical information model by
methods in the refElement(), refMethod(), and refClass() methods. If you
only want your project structure in the XML file, set to "false".
c.       static final boolean printDebug = false;  There is a large amount
of debug "System.out.println()" calls in the Scope classes.  The printDebug
flag in CodeProject is a global flag to enable or disable the possibility
for all of these messages.  When printDebug is set to true in the
CodeProject class, you must go to the individual class files to turn on
messages. Other classes with the printDebug flag are ClassScope,
CodeBlockScope, DebugStack (commented out in defs.g, prerefs.g, and refs.g),
FileScope, and ParameterScope.
B.      In MyOutput.java, final static String OUTPUTDIR = "./"; set the
output directory (OUTPUTDIR), or leave as the current directory (".\")
 
6.	Compile the *.java files with the following commands 
7.	A. javac *.java (or whatever compiler you use) 
8.	test run 
A.      cd c:\antlr.xref\src
B.      "java org.antlr.java.crossref.Main" should produce usage message
"Usage: Main (directory or filename)"
C.       
9.	Another test with real data 
A.      "java org.antlr.java.crossref.Main
org\antlr\java\crossref\location.java"
B.      This will produce many messages to the console in addition to a 70k
xml file to the current directory named "null.xml"
C.      I'll go back and set saveReference = false and recompile and re-run.
D.      I still get all the messages but the xml file is now 9k, but it
contains no reference information.  It just contains the
package/class/field/method structure.  This is good for structure analysis
but not for seeing which classes reference others.
 
 
Credits
 
All "borrowed" classes are from the open source community.  I have no
obligation to give credit to these sources.  However, their mention will
give credit where I think it is due.  
 
K files
 
The "K" files are used to read the input stream from a "*.class" file,
extracting the relevant information.  They are used with minor modification,
mostly to the javadoc section.  These files are the work of Kimberley
Burchett. "Class loading" the files was a short bad idea.  Thanks for saving
me some time, Kimberly!  I kept the class file writer with the code for
those of you who want to do some obfuscation work.
 
http://www.kimbly.com/code/classfile/
<http://www.kimbly.com/code/classfile/> 
 
Location AST help
 
I read the antlraux site to help with the LocationAST work.
 
http://antlraux.sourceforge.net/ <http://antlraux.sourceforge.net/> 
 
Java Cross Reference Tool
 
Antlr and the structure for the tool are based on the work of Terence Parr.
You should be versed in Antlr basics to use this tool. (www.antlr.org
<http://www.antlr.org/> )
 
To Do List
1. Reduce size of XML document
2. Revisit order of imports and "Classpath order".
3. Upgrade java.g
4. Streamline installation
5. Reorganize the user options
6. Redo Location information.  Problem finding files based on XML
information.
7. Bugs

Which is why I used in my  psuedo code ;-)

But fine, I used returned values in my rules all the time too. 
The traditional alternatives to a return value are

1) reference parameters

void Rule123( .... , ref ResultInfo result) { 

   result = null; // assume success;


   if( someproblem) result = new ResultInfo();    
    
}


2) Sticking the result into some globally accessable place such as a member.  Results could even
be held in a stack, equivlent to inputState.guessing.  

    ....
    Rule456( ); 
    if(  globalResultState != null )  break;

Actually, there is an approach for syn preds that would avoid exceptions.  That is to generate separate function calls for synpreds 
which return "true" or "false".  It would not be _that_ difficult to "inline" the rules called by a synpred, and the code generated would be 
fairly stripped down because of the lack of actions--it might not add much compared to the "if (guessing)" that is done now.

They don't work for primitives in Java unfortunately.

But a bit slower, though workable.  I've considered this for ANTLR 3.

Thanks for the suggestions :)

Howdy,

Makes recursive and nested structures pretty tough.  And most of the

Pretty slow creating a new result object for each match isn't it?  An

Breaks are gotos and don't necessary lend themselves to more readable 
code ;)

Nope, you missed a comment.  
In my examples ResultInfo is null on success.  So 90% of the time it will be null
and easy to test. 
Maybe I should have called it ErrorState or something

Of couse.

ResultInfo would be a object.

whew! 
did not mean to start a flame war. 

btw Terr,  I like antlr a lot.  Thanks. 
I am using it in product that is close to shipping.
So I am starting to think about speedups. 

Good luck

Yeah, been thinking of doing this so that we can have multiple return 
values like PCCTS had.  Also, I need to add a new and improved 
attribute mechanism that Monty/Loring/I came up with this Summer.

I thought java exceptions were expensive only if they
were thrown, and that try blocks were relatively
cheap.  One would think that in the worst case they
would just require pushing an exception handler address
onto a stack (on entering the try block) and popping it
off on exit - or is this the overhead you're talking about ?

Hey Karl,

If you are looking at performance issues one item you might look at is
how often are you using the tree parser?

The tree parser in the general nature of how it works (i.e. walking a
linked list of tree nodes) is a major performance killer. This is due to
the problem of the next node not being in the CPU's data cache thus
requiring a trip to main memory for the data. 

In my component I was initially using the tree parser to do a lot of my
runtime operations and was facing major performance issues. I changed my
application (which is in C#) to generate a runtime class to handle the
operations with major performance improvements.

Don't know if this helps you but I figured I'd mention it.

Tom--

The problem is that syntactic predicates are implemented through
exceptions and that larger grammars tend to have enough ambiguities
(some due to the approx-LLk algorithm) to require a sizeable number of
syntactic predicates so that the resultant applications throw lots of
exceptions.

Ter's LL-regular analysis (which includes "under the hood" left
factoring) will cut down on the number of synpreds in application
grammars, but probably not eliminate them.

Syn preds also lead to redundant computation--first you traverse rules
in "guessing" mode and then in "action" mode to do the actual tree
construction and action execution.  That is also expensive.

There are two optimization approaches which would work to cut down
synpred overhead.  One of these is to "log" a record of parsed tokens
when guessing and then to process that log as soon as a parse has been
committed to.  The alternative is to implement synpreds as function
calls and to inline any rules called (recursion-to-iteration
transformation might be desirable) by the synpred.  Some additional
analysis might serve to generate minimal synpreds.  I haven't a clue
as to which approach would lead to better performance, but I think
that the second approach could be implemented within ANTLR 2 with 2-3
weeks of solid work--it's mostly adding a second walk through the
custom graph which ANTLR uses internally.  Having dug into ANTLR 2
internals, though, I think that I'll wait for ANTLR 3.

Cheers!

Hi Richard,

I'm not sure you can compare a hand-built class of unknown structure to  
the regular tree parsers.  The algorithm is linear, but possibly with a  
large constant in front.  I doubt the CPU cache is the big issue,  
particularly if you do multiple walks...the entire tree might fit in a  
cache if it's small enough.

It is a good point to bring up thought that walking the entire tree  
with the parser is sometimes slower than you need it to be...irregular  
walking can be a big win as you say.

I don't know if it was implied but I felt I should specify that the
custom class is generated with the Tree Parser walking the same tree
structure that I use to walk for data processing. So I do take a certain
cost up front generating the class but successive runs run extremely
fast. So it is also leans more towards you evaluation Ter, the CPU cache
may play a small part but the custom class versus invoking the tree
parser is the major part of the performance improvement.

Subject: [antlr-interest] antlr book chapter
Message-ID: <btj8dl+o6v9@eGroups.com>

Hi,

the 2nd edition of the german book "open source programming tools" has
a new chapter about antlr.  The book is now being translated and for
that reason we are looking for a native english speaker who would be
interested to read (and comment) the antlr chapter before publication.
 Please contact me if you are interested.

Regards,
Jens Krinke

Subject: [antlr-interest] Troubles with TokenString
Message-ID: <200401081346.27610.luca@lookee.it>

I'm an Italian studend and I'm working for a code restructuring tool wich 
parallelize loops in java sources.

I'm using antlr with TokenStringRewriteEngine to: cut, paste, modify and 
replace chunk of code.

I'm using TokenStringRewriteEngine (I know that it isn't full tested tool) as 
showed in: 
"Syntax Directed TokenStream Rewriting"
http://www.antlr.org/article/rewrite.engine/index.tml

To reproduce my trouble on TokenStringRewriteEngine.toString(int, int) method, 
I can use the code reported in the article:

GenHdr.java
tinyc.g
input.c
TokenStreamRewriteEngine.java
TokenWithIndex.java

The problem
I'll modify ONLY one line to reproduce my problem in GenHdr.java

if I change this line:

System.out.print(rewriteEngine.toString());

with:

System.out.print(rewriteEngine.toString(0,rewriteEngine.getTokenStreamSize()));

all works perfectly :-)

but if put:
 
System.out.print(rewriteEngine.toString(x,y)); 
where x,y are two valid int index in [0,rewriteEngine.getTokenStreamSize]

system hang and output does not work properly :-(

Can someone help me?

Subject: [antlr-interest] caseSensitiveLiterals
Message-ID: <btjot2+88pk@eGroups.com>

Hi,

I am confused by the "caseSensitiveLiterals" option.  When I added it 
to my parser, antlr compains with:

ANTLR Parser Generator   Version 2.7.2   1989-2003 jGuru.com
Augmentor.g:22:0: Invalid option: caseSensitiveLiterals
Exiting due to errors.

I can stick the options in the lexer, but will my resulting system 
still treat literals as non case-sensitive when they are entered as 
strings in the parser?  If so, this is non-intuitive.  The 
documentation says that the option is allowed in a grammar - is this 
the same as a parser?

P.S. - The documentation looks like it could use a little work 
(fixing typos if nothing else).  Is there any interest in getting 
some of this done?

Thanks,

We're currently trying out moderation of the first post of a user. This to

For example if you have a rule like this:

IDENTIFIER options { testLiterals = true; }:
 ( 'a' .. 'z' | 'A' .. 'Z' | '_' )
 ( 'a' .. 'z' | 'A' .. 'Z' | '0'..'9' | '_' | '#' )*
;

The token returned will have the same case as was entered by the user yet
when checking against the literals table (literals as specified in the
tokens section) the case is ignored. If you need the text downcased or in
upper case you can use $setText to set the required return string.

Looking at the docs it should mean parser. I'm not sure why it lists
grammar as one of the options for caseSensitiveLiterals, AFAIK it is only
used inside the lexer.

If you want to invest some time in this it would probably be very welcome.
You might want to check with Terence I recall him mentioning that he wanted
to change the documentation format or something. Structurally the docs are
not really ideal.

Cheers,

Ric

Interesting.  So you do one tree walk with antlr to generate your own 
walker and then use that?  Cool.

Can you tell us what your custom "parser" looks like?  I'm very 
interested in speed improvements for ANTLR 3.

Hi Jens,

Great!  I don't have much time, but I could do a general read for 
technical issues if you want.

Hi. :)

Thanks for trying out the rewrite engine!  Wow. Must be some weird  
infinite loop in my toString().  I'm swamped at the moment, but could  
you try stepping through with a debugger in toString()?  It should be  
looping endlessly there.  Or, let it hang and then see if you can stop  
it to see where it's at.

Regards,
Ter

Hi Jens,

If Ter wants to do the technical scan, my wife (who is a great proof reader)
has offered to do the English proofing, if that helps.  (That's UK English
not US English)

I use antlr, so I can advise her on the occasional bits she gets stuck on.

Try java antlr.Tool yourfile.g

See install.html and the doc directory from the distribution.

> pls provide me some information how can i run antlr for C#.

This is controlled by the Language option in the grammar file, see the
examples/csharp part I guess. I recommend reading the docs and/or some
tutorials (see http://www.antlr.org) first before continuing.

Cheers,

Ric

My two bits - in RefactorIT we succeeded to speed antlr up many times.
Generated lexer was frozen at some point and the changes and 
optimizations were hardcoded :( Unfortunately nobody remembers anymore 
what exactly was done there, but I have CVS logs at hand :)  May be I 
will post some hints when will be upgrading to 3.0.

As for the parser, intermediate class was introduced and the original 
generated parser class is postprocessed in Ant target by replacing some 
strings:
- extends clause - replaced LLkParser with our superclass
- tokens are read altogether into array and consume(), LL() & LT() etc. 
work with the array
- ASTPair is stored in a pool and not generated in every rule
- LA(1) is replaced with a field usage
...
just take a look inside with a proper profiler

Good luck!

Interesting...this is what PCCTS did originally when syn preds were 
used.

Thanks for the hints, Anton.  Be assured that the next system will pay 
careful attention to speed.  I anticipate multiple options to control 
code generation that will allow you to turn the knob from 
readable/flexible to less-readable/hardcoded for speed.

RefactorIT looks like a great product...have you posted to the showcase 
at antlr.org?

You'd have to hack the code generator classes to change the extension.
Safer to do a shell script.

Subject: [antlr-interest] C++ Comment like parsing
Message-ID: <btnjmg+gnp5@eGroups.com>

Hi, 

I'm aiming at writing a JSP/ASP like parser. For starters, I wrote a 
grammar to parse a standard C++ comment. However, my grammar doesn't 
work. If I pass /* x */ to the parser, I get an error. Actually, I 
want to get just "x".  I'm not sure what to do to get the parser to 
read the text between /* and */.

Below is my grammar. Note that the comment part was taken from the 
Java grammar.

Thanks
Werner



options
{
  language="Cpp";
}

{
#include <iostream>
#include <antlr/Token.hpp>

}
class MyParser extends Parser;

startRule
    :   n:ML_COMMENT
        {std::cout << "Hi there, " /*<< n->getText()*/ << std::endl;}
    ;

class MyLexer extends Lexer;
options
{
  k=2;
}
	
	// multiple-line comments
ML_COMMENT
:	"/*"

			options {
				generateAmbigWarnings=false;
			}
		:
			{ LA(2)!='/' }? '*'
		|	'\r' '\n'		{newline();}
		|	'\r'			{newline();}
		|	'\n'			{newline();}
		|	~('*'|'\n'|'\r')

Werner--

You need to include
      charVocabulary='\003' .. '\377';
in your lexer options.  (Other ranges are possible, but this is the usual choice.)
The ~( * | '\n' | '\r' )* won't match " x " without it.

Message-ID: <20040112162403.11976.qmail@web12708.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I have a set of Lex/Yacc grammars for MDX a very large
query language similar to SQL but intended for
formulating queries against OLAP data sources.  I'm
wondering if anyone could offer an opinion as to how
hard it would be to convert them to ANTLR?  Obviously,
it depends on a lot of variables but in general would
the process be a pretty straight forward conversion or
would much of the grammar need to be rethought? 
Thanks in advance for any replies.

-jason

ps - Obviously if someone happens to have an ANTLR mdx
grammar laying around I'd love to hear about it :)

Funny. I need to do this too. :-) (Got some changes to make to the Java 
indexer, and now that ObjC++ is supported again I want to make it 
cleaner. Yes, the Java indexer predates ObjC++ support in gcc 3.)

Subject: [antlr-interest] Help on error handling in antlr grammar...
Message-ID: <200401130456.i0D4ujlo022602@mail6.bigmailbox.com>

Hi,
I'm using ANTLR for validating the user entered commands in command line 
interface (CLI).

One sample of the command is "edit logsettings logid [{emaildest}]".
{} means that it can be an array list seperated with ',' (comma) & [] means that 
the parameter is optional.
'logid' will take any of the digit & 'emaildest' will take an email id as its 
value.

I need to handle the error situations & have to show appropriate error message 
to the user.
Here are the different kind of errors that can be produced as a result of the 
command.

Success Cases:

1. I/P: edit logsettings logid = 123

2. I/P: edit logsettings logid = 123 emaildest = vamsikp406@kiwibox.com

Failure Cases:

1. I/P: edit logsettings
   O/P: logid parameter missing.

2. I/P: edit logsettings logid = 2a
   O/P: logid value invalid.

3. I/P: edit logsettings abcd logid = 123
   O/P: abcd parameter unknown.

4. I/P: edit logsettings logid = 123 emaildest = _vamsikp@kiwibox.com
   O/P: emaildest value invalid.

5. I/P: edit logsettings logid = 123 emaildest = vamsikp@kiwibox.com logid = 
234
   O/P: logid parameter repeated.


The grammar file that I had written for the command is attached.

With this, I'm getting non-determinism errors due to the last rule (ID). So 
error handling is not complete.
And for some commands, the value of a parameter can contain the white spaces 
also that needs to be taken for value.
Can anyone help me out what could be the better way to handle the above 
mentioned errors. It's very urgent for me.

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Vamsi.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Tree Walking
Message-ID: <bu11l5+ek9h@eGroups.com>

Hi,

I have been using ANTLR for parsing purposes. And now I also need to 
build some expression language that will have simple operators, basic 
types and conditional statements as well as functions.

Since I'm going to use variables in my language, I want to 
use ANTLR in two steps: 
First parsing input and creating AST Tree at load time.
Second walking this tree later in runtime interpreting
the tree with actual variable data multiple times.

My idea was to evaluate conditional expressions and based on that
calculate statements.

It appeares that Actions defined for Tree Walker are executed
anyway (when matching those nodes in a tree). I can deal with
it by evaluating the result of condition passing it as argument to 
statement. However it seems to me that I'll match all nodes in 
subtree even if its actions shouldn't be executed.
Has anybody have an idea what is the performance overhead of matching
tree nodes without executing the actions?

I've also tried to use transformation and Walk Parser generated tree 
twice: first calculating conditions and generating subtree and 
secondly executing actions for that subtree. However buildAST option 
when defined for Walker causes application crash when creating the 
tree. The same thing happens in cpp\transform example.

Has anybody had a similar problem? I'm using antlr-2.7.2 (libcpp) and 
it worked perfectly when parsing things.

I'll appreciate any approach idea for my problem and specific hints 
how to generate second AST.

Regards,
Z.G.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Layout processing
Message-ID: <Sea1-F105IcZXEJVTNA000571e6@hotmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm rather new to ANTLR processing and I was wondering if ANTLR could solve 
my problem.

The language that I am trying to parse contains layout characters (mainly 
whitespaces). As I understand in ANTLR, these layout characters should be 
handled in the lexer and ignored at the source. The problem is that I would 
like to keep them in the parse tree without having to sparkle them all over 
the grammar.

Would it be possible to override LA() and match() to be able to skip 
(ignore) layout tokens while at the same time keeping them in the parse 
tree?

I know that stated this way, it is ambigous, how can ANTLR, without further 
information, know where to place the WS in the parse tree? In my example, I 
would like WS to be "factored" out of rules as much as possible so that they 
are only present in the body of a rule, not at the start nor at the end of 
them.

State that way, there is only one place for every WS present in the instance 
to parse. Not knowing that much about ANTLR, is there a way to automagically 
override a certain function to obtain this behaviour?

My only alternative is to sprinkle (WS)? elements nearly everywhere in the 
grammar... Certainly there is a better way to do this since this would beef 
up my grammar by 50% (in characters) and also give me the headache of a 
lifetime figuring out the right k because of all the optional WS that could 
happen.

Thanks in advance!
Daniel Shane

Don't know how good/bad it is. Would depend a lot on the input.

Have you tried the 2.7.3 release candidate ? 2.7.2 had quite some oopses.

Terrance 

Since you are thinking about 3.0, I thought I might throw out one more suggestion. 

In the version I am using only protected token rules can have return values.   The documentation
notes this is mostly an artifact of how tokens are processed by the next function of the lexer. 

Have you thought about using generic templates as the base class of Token?

That way you can stuff a value into a token during a token rule and get it out easily during
higher level processing.   But it 
still follows all the interfaces for a token. 

Karl

I've done a similar program to yours (I think). It's a simple language that
has operations and some statements (if, for, while) and user defined
functions. You can find all the source code at
http://www.adersoftware.com/?page=compilers
It has java and c# implementation (sorry not c++).
But I didn't use antlr generated AST. I just never liked those generics
AST's and prefer writing my own that more closely matches the language. Nice
thing about it is that if you write it once, you can easily reuse it in
other programs.

Hi Loring, thanks for your pointer it has proven very usefull.

However, it does not completely solve my problem... Maybe Terence 
can give me some further cues when he has some time. The problem 
arrises when I want to convert a document to SGML and the DTD 
specifies inclusions (that is elements that can appear anywhere 
between other elements).

Here is a quick example of what I would like to accomplish.

For example, lets say I have a rule:

a: b c

It should have been written like this if we wanted to consider 
possible inclusions:

a: b (inc)* c

Now, if I (only) had:

a: b c? d?

Things get much more messy to avoid running into infinite lookahead 
problems... (imagine a fully fledged rule)

a: (b (inc)* c)=>
   (
     b (inc)*
     (
       (c (inc)* d) =>
       (
         c (inc)* d
       )
       |
       d
     )
   )
   |
   (b (inc)* d)=>
   (
     b (inc)* d
   )
   |
   b

I could write a pre-processor that would rewrite all my rules with 
all the various combinations *, + and | that can arrise. However 
this is a big task...

Dont forget that sometimes in the DTD inc can appear explicitly.

I'm not sure I can accomplish something similar using actions and 
overriding default lexer/parser/tree/token behavior...

Subject: [antlr-interest] ANTLR and C# parser
Message-ID: <bu20g8+114k2@eGroups.com>

 Hi,

I have to build a C# parser based on ANTLR as part of my project. I 
succeeded to run nant to build the release version of ANTLR for C# 
(based on the ANTLR Documentation section). My questions are:

1. With the csharp grammar provided by Rajendra Kumar Komandur (from 
the ANTLR website), parser that is generated from that grammar is in 
Java or C#?
   _ I ran java antlr.Tool csharp.g and the following Java classes 
are generated:
       * GeneratedCSharpRecognizer.java
       * GeneratedCSharpLexer.java
       * GeneratedCSharpTokenTypes.java
       * GeneratedCSharpTokenTypes.txt
   _ Is it the correct behaviour that it's suppose to be?


2. I wrote a Main.java class (which listed below) to call those 
generated classes that I mentioned in question 1. Here my Main class

import java.io.*;
import antlr.collections.AST;
import antlr.collections.impl.*;
import antlr.debug.misc.*;
import antlr.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		try
		{
			File f = new File(args[0]);
			Reader r = new BufferedReader(new FileReader
(f));
		
			// Create a scanner that reads from the
                        // input stream passed to us
			GeneratedCSharpLexer lexer = new 
GeneratedCSharpLexer(r);
			lexer.setFilename(f.getName());

			// Create a parser that reads from the 
                       // scanner
			GeneratedCSharpRecognizer parser = new 
GeneratedCSharpRecognizer(lexer);
			parser.setFilename(f.getName());

			// start parsing at the compilationUnit rule
			parser.compilationUnit();
		}
		catch(FileNotFoundException fnfe)
		{
			fnfe.printStackTrace();
		}
		catch(RecognitionException re)
		{
			re.printStackTrace();
		}
		catch(TokenStreamException tse)
		{
			tse.printStackTrace();
		}
	}	
}


However i got the following error message: 

    "expected token: class"

when I attempt to parse a C# program using java Main mycsharp.cs

   Do any of you have any idea what's wrong here? and how do I fix 
it?
 

3. Is there anyway to make the provided csharp grammar to generated 
C# parser class instead of Java class? I attempted to specify the 
language option in the grammar file. However, I got error too.

Thanks a lot for your help.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Announcing GDL, a free IDL compatible incremental compiler based on ANTLR
Message-ID: <bu34go+u1kc@eGroups.com>

IDL stands here for Interactive Data Language which is a registered
trademark of Research Systems Inc. (see: http://www.rsinc.com)
It is particular useful for data analysis, supports OOP and has very
powerful array operations.

This project might be interesting for people reading this newsgroup as
GDL is based on ANTLR (2.7.2, C++ mode) and it demonstrates many of
ANTLR's possibilities.

Thanks from here to all ANTLR developers for providing this great tool!

Check out the grammer files (*.g in the gdl subdirectory).

There is a lexer/parser (gdlc.g),
a compiler (tree parser) (gdlc.tree.g)
and the interpreter (gdlc.i.g).

Furthermore there are cformat.g  format.g  format.in.g  format.out.g
for formatted input/output.

Any feedback is welcome.


GDL - GNU Data Language
Version: 0.6.1


DOWNLOAD:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnudatalanguage/


FEATURES:

Full syntax compatibility with IDL 6.0

All IDL language elements are supported, including:

Pointers,
Objects,
Structs,
Arrays,
System variables,
Common blocks,
Assoc variables,
All operators,
_EXRA and _REF_EXTRA keywords...

The file input output system is fully implemented
(Exception: For formatted I/O the C() sub-codes are not supported yet)

So far only some library routines are implemented (among them the
EXECUTE function). For a list enter HELP,/LIB at the command prompt.

No graphic support (graphical output (PLOT,...) and widgets)
is implemented so far.

Please see the README file for more details.

Check it out!

Thanks Matt.

That is one of the approaches that I have been looking into but I am
screwing something up.  In my first meager attempt, this is what I have:

STRING_LITERAL
	:	( STRCHAR ) ( ( STRCHAR | ' ' )* ( STRCHAR ) ) *
	;

protected 
STRCHAR
	:	( 'a'..'z'
        | 'A'..'Z'
        | '0'..'9'
        | '!'..'$'
        | '\''..'/'
        | ';'
        | '?'..'@'
        | '['..'_'
        | '{'
        | '}'..'~'
        )
	;

But I get a non-determinism error message.  If instead I change the
STRING_LITERAL to:

STRING_LITERAL
	:	( STRCHAR ) ( STRCHAR | ' ' )* 
	;

This appears to work but it allows spaces at the end of the literals.

I am one of the least knowledgeable folks on this
list; mostly I just recycle random bits and pieces of
others' advice that has stuck in my mind for one
reason or another... seems like you could screw around
with greedy options and lookahead to eliminate the
nondeterminism.  Or I have seen cases where you knew
the nondeterminism was there, but also knew that
ANTLR's default response would be the correct one, and
therefore just shut the warning off.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Announcing GDL, a free IDL compatible incremental
compiler based on ANTLR

IDL stands here for Interactive Data Language which is a registered
trademark of Research Systems Inc. (see: http://www.rsinc.com)
It is particular useful for data analysis, supports OOP and has very
powerful array operations.

This project might be interesting for people reading this newsgroup as
GDL is based on ANTLR (2.7.2, C++ mode) and it demonstrates many of
ANTLR's possibilities.

Thanks from here to all ANTLR developers for providing this great tool!

Check out the grammer files (*.g in the gdl subdirectory).

There is a lexer/parser (gdlc.g),
a compiler (tree parser) (gdlc.tree.g)
and the interpreter (gdlc.i.g).

Furthermore there are cformat.g  format.g  format.in.g  format.out.g
for formatted input/output.

Any feedback is welcome.


GDL - GNU Data Language
Version: 0.6.1


DOWNLOAD:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnudatalanguage/


FEATURES:

Full syntax compatibility with IDL 6.0

All IDL language elements are supported, including:

Pointers,
Objects,
Structs,
Arrays,
System variables,
Common blocks,
Assoc variables,
All operators,
_EXRA and _REF_EXTRA keywords...

The file input output system is fully implemented
(Exception: For formatted I/O the C() sub-codes are not supported yet)

So far only some library routines are implemented (among them the
EXECUTE function). For a list enter HELP,/LIB at the command prompt.

No graphic support (graphical output (PLOT,...) and widgets)
is implemented so far.

Please see the README file for more details.

Check it out!

Subject: [antlr-interest] How to describe this in ANTLR?
Message-ID: <Sea1-F108V6sI1ZfjJ40004b077@hotmail.com>

Hi, I have two cases I'm trying to solve using ANTLR..

First, what is the best way of writting this so that its deterministic?

a: b? c? d? e? f? b?

Is this the best way?

a: (b (c | d | e | f)) => b c? d? e? f? b?
| (c | d | e | f) => c? d? e? f? b?
| b?

Secondly, I'm trying to recognize text which contain footnotes. For example:

Section
This is paragraph 1 * <- footnote Reference
This is paragraph 2 ** <- footnote Reference
** footnote 2
* footnote 1

A section can end with a footnote as well as paragraphs. If the footnote is 
for the preceding paragraph, then it goes with it, else it goes at the end 
of the section.

section: paragraph+ footnote*
paragraph: text footnoteRef? footnote*
footnote: footnoteRef text

The problem is that stated this way the grammar is non deterministic, 
however, by matching the footnoteRef to the footnote it is possible to know 
if a footnote goes in the section or at the end of a paragraph.

In the above example, here is the tree that should be recognized:

<Section>
<Paragraph><text>This is paragraph 
1</text><footnoteRef>*</footnoteRef></Paragraph>
<Paragraph><text>This is paragraph 2</text><footnoteRef>**</footnoteRef>
<footnote><footnoteRef>**</footnoteRef> footnote 2</footnote>
</Paragraph>
<footnote><footnoteRef>*</footnoteRef> footnote 1</footnote>
</Section>

Is there a way to accomplish this using semantic predicates? If I understand 
semantic predicate will return an error and parsing will fail if the 
condition evaluates to anything but true right? So I can place a semantic 
predicate that would try to match the footnote with the right footnoteRef?

Subject: [antlr-interest] Antlr cant make or configure w/ cygwin bash
Message-ID: <bu4mmo+qtmv@eGroups.com>

Ok, some problems with configure and make with Antlr 2.7.2 and the
cygwin bash shell.

Basically configure and the makefile call java.exe with a -cp codepath
that it built using pwd.  Cygwin pwd gives a unix path such as
/usr/src/antlr-2.7.2/, however java.exe isn't a cygwin app and doesn't
understand unix paths on a windows system.  So it needs something like
"java.exe -cp $(cygpath -wp $(pwd)) antlr.jar antlr.tool".

Also with 2.7.2, configure sets the codepath wrong with a colon in it,
so no go there either.

This is the best solution.  In English that predicate says if you see any
number of spaces followed by a STRCHAR then go ahead and match the spaces
and STRCHARs.  You may get a warning from ANTLR that the syntactic predicate
is superfluous but in fact it is not and this should work.  Inspect the
generated code to convince yourself that it is right (that's the best way to
learn how antlr really works too.)

You may be better off recognizing

a: (b | c | d | e | f)* ; 

and then have an action that checks that they came in the right order.
However, your solution should work too.  

On the other hand, ANTLR will do the right thing with your original even
though it is non-deterministic.  Inspect the generated code and see.

For the second question, again ANTLR will do the right thing and match if it
can in the paragraph rule, otherwise it would be matched in the section
rule.  This is the same problem as with if/else statements.  By the way,
your grammar for paragraph/footnote doesn't quite make sense with
footnoteRef being matched twice in a row.

predicate that would try to match the footnote with the right footnoteRef?

Yeah, maybe its better to use a grammar that is more loose in order 
to reduce complexity. However, I have to be carefull because 
depending on the right hand side of c,d,e,f staring them could in 
itself cause an even more ambigous grammar. 

However, in the footnote case, I was rather concerned about the 
ability to direct a parse based on the comparaison of the two 
footnote refs (the number of stars have to match).

In that case I believe that sematic predicate mught just do the job. 

Thanks for the advise!

This is the best solution.  In English that predicate says if you see any
number of spaces followed by a STRCHAR then go ahead and match the spaces
and STRCHARs.  You may get a warning from ANTLR that the syntactic predicate
is superfluous but in fact it is not and this should work.  Inspect the
generated code to convince yourself that it is right (that's the best way to
learn how antlr really works too.)

Hello to everyone!

It has been some time since my last post here!

For the impatient, here are the links:

Complete guide in PDF:
  http://www.lsi.us.es/~troyano/documentos/guia.pdf

A zip with separated files for each chapter, in PDF:
  http://www.lsi.us.es/~troyano/documentos/guia-cap.zip

Well, it is not "a book" but my "end-of studies project"; it is a
guide to ANTLR 2.7.2. It only considers java mode, and it is
completely written in spanish, so I don't know wether it will be of
use for many people of the list. It treats however some interesting
concepts like error treatment and compiler basics.

During the development of my project, I also developed an auxiliar
library, antlraux:
  http://antlraux.sourceforge.net

Both my (ex)university (University of Seville, Spain) and me own the
rights of the document, but it is free for educational purposes. I
finished it on september 2003, but it hasn't been published until
recently.

I included both links on the "articles" section of www.antlr.org;
unfortunately non-english chars seem to be not very well supported by
the site! Doh!

Well, have fun!

Hi all,
I think there is an error in the Comment rule in the html.g example

 was {LA(2)!='-' && LA(3)!='>'}? '-' // allow '-' if not "-->"
   actually     and if not "-?>" and if not "--?"  these cases cause early
termination of the comment rule befor end of comment reached.

 should be  {(LA(2)!='-')  || (LA(2)=='-' && LA(3)!='>') }? '-' // allow '-'
and "--?" and "-?>" but not "-->"

replacement rule follows below.

You may need to check any other rules you have coded based on this template
of testing for a termination string.  I found this problem while  trying to
get another rule to work that was based on this template.

Ok configure works good if CLASSPATH is defined as it says.  make
doesn't work because the call to fix_path can't handle the outer $().

$(call fix_path,$(TOPDIR)/antlr.jar)

this evaluates to blank since it can't see the $(1)

Subject: [antlr-interest] ANTLR not generating correct end condition on greedy=false loop.
Message-ID: <Sea1-F26DSsB4Wm81AD00063a11@hotmail.com>

Hi,

Why does this grammar result in an invalid condition to break out of the 
loop:

a: LCURLY any RCURLY;
b: PLUS any MINUS;

any: ( options { greedy=false; } : . )*;

On input

{ fdsfa + fdsfds - fdsfds }

The condition for end of loop is all tokens that can follow any (in this 
case MINUS and RCURLY) even if its quite obvious from the grammar that when 
inside rule a, rule b can never trigger. This of course will give an invalid 
parse because the loop will stop at - and it will expect a RCURLY.

To make this grammar work I have to write:

a: LCURLY ( options { greedy=false; } : . )*  RCURLY;
b: PLUS ( options { greedy=false; } : . )*  MINUS;

so that the end condition is ok. Is there a way to make the above grammar 
work? Is there a good reason for this kind of limitation?

Daniel Shane

Yup.  This is because ANTLR is not a full LL(k) parser (which is highly 
nonlinear).  There is no context information--just lookahead 
information in an SLL(k) parser.  ANTLR can only see the global 
FOLLOW(any), which is the union of all possible contexts.  Sorry about 
that...  One solution is to simply embed the any look inside a and b.

Oh, ok, you got the solution.  The reason is per the above that 
manually splitting/duplicating rules automatically results in some 
pretty big parsers so people tend to build SLL(k) not LL(k).  Same goes 
for LR vs LALR/SLR parsers.  LR is a damn big parser often times.

Ed--

I think that there is a better approach for this particular problem. 
I've been doing a fair amount of work lately interfacing the Python
runtime as the backend for a spacecraft modeling language and using
SWIG for interfacing C/C++ functions with Python.  It is easy to call
Python from C/C++ and vice versa.  C/C++ functions integrate nicely in
shared library form, and I think a better approach for the problem you
mention would be C++/Python hybrid approach.  The idea would be to
build a shared library/Python module from a C++-targeted antlr C
grammar with calls to Python from the tree walker.  That should give
you both the advantage of compiled C/C++ speed and Python flexibility.

Me again, the fix works great if instead of

fix_path=$(cygpath -wp "$(1)")

you put

fix_path=`cygpath -wp "$(1)"`


Thanks alot

I've made some progress with the Amol's code that was uploaded to 
antlr.org.  It's at the point where it generates correct code for 
calc.g but not java.g.  I've also converted the ANTLR runtime classes 
into Python so the generated code runs with standard Python (i.e., 
doesn't require Jython).  One of the main remaining issues is getting 
non-trivial "case" statements converted to Python, which only provides 
"if-elif-else".

I'd be happy to upload what I've got to antlr.org or create a 
Sourceforge project so that other folks can get involved -- I haven''t 
had much time to spend on it lately.  Let me know what you think would 
work best for this kind of project.

Michael.

Michael--

An alternative approach to case statements would be to build a
dictionaries with lambda entries as data--then do lookup and execute.
 That should map fairly easily onto the ANTLR code generation framework.

Thanks - I agree that's a good approach for a lot of cases, but lambdas 
can only be simple expressions and ANTLR generates code with some cases 
that raise exceptions or break or nest switch statements, so 
unfortunately dictionaries of lambdas can't handle everything that 
ANTLR's generated code needs to do.

Michael.

Ah shot myself in the foot... that should have been $(shell cygpath -wp "$(1)")
but the `` do the job as well.

Fixed now :)

Humm...

In that case I think macros would greatly improve the readability of 
my grammar, since I am using a lot of non-greedy loops. It would 
make a lot of sense in that context.

I'm using a 3rd party solution for macros, but do you think ANTLR 
will have macro support with arguments anytime soon? Maybe for 
version 3?

I think that you'd be much better off not using the "greedy" option,
which is a bit of a hack mainly intended for use in lexers.  From your

you can make your grammar easier to read by changing the above
definitions to

a :  LCURLY ( ~RCURLY )* RCURLY ;
b :  PLUS  ( ~MINUS )* MINUS ;

There are occasions when macros or "generic" rules would be
convenient, but then there comes the point at which you need to insert
actions.  Somehow, the "generic" aspects of the grammar start to
disappear.

Hmm...probably not.  I was toying with the idea of doing an automatic

Subject: [antlr-interest] WebStringTemplates V1.4 released
Message-ID: <001b01c3df38$01aea050$0400a8c0@NOTEBOOK>

Hi All,
This is to announce the release of WebStringTemplates V1.4
(based on Terence's StringTemplates).

WebStringTemplate and a detailed tutorial is available from
http://www.forward.com.au/webstringtemplates

An outline follows.

all the best
matthew
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------

WebStringTemplates V1.4
The better Java template engine.

Programmers, work in Java/JSP without HTML.
   System Architects, specify the interface.
      Web Designers, leave Java/JSP to the Programmers.


WebStringTemplates is an easy to use Java template engine that separates web
page design from the server coding. It defines a clean data interface
between the the servlet/JSP and the web page. This Data Interface Definition
file defines what data is available and provides sample data for development
purposes. Once this interface is defined as a HTML document, the Web Page
Designer and the Programmer can independently do their jobs without
interfering with each other. It is the Programmer's responsiblity to ensure
the data specified is available and correctly formatted, without having to
worry about where it will be displayed on the page. It is the Web Page
Designer's responsibility to display the data in a pleasing manner, with
roll overs, drop down menus etc., but without having to worry about the
actual data being displayed.

WebStringTemplates is free for commercial use, subject to its licence.
Download it from http://www.forward.com.au/webstringtemplates

WebStringTemplates is an extension of Terence Parr's excellent
StringTemplate package. WebStringTemplates makes some small modifications to
the syntax, adds the Data Interface Definition file and its parser, the Web
Page Designer's interactive viewing tool, comment attributes, data filters,
support routines to simplify converting existing JSP pages and servlets and
this documentation. WebStringTemplate also uses Terence's Antlr complier
generator to parse the Data Interface Definition file.


Why do I need WebStringTemplates?
----------------------------------------
If you are a Web Designer, then to take full advantage of JSP, you must
first learn Java which is time consuming and can be quite challenging. Then
you need to set up a server to develop and test JSPs which can be a
confusing and frustrating task. Wouldn't you prefer to just stick to HTML

If you are a Programmer, then with JSP it is still to easy to mix HTML code
with business logic, with each one making it hard to understand the other.
Wouldn't you prefer to just code the business logic and leave the HTML to
the web designer.

If you are a System Architect, the mixing of HTML and Java code / JSP tags
makes it difficult to separate the page design from the coding/business
logic design and changes in one risk interfering with the operation of the
other. There is no clear, well defined interface between the two. Wouldn't
you like to be able to define a clear, clean interface that separates the
code from the web page.

WebStringTemplates solves all of these problems. See the on-line tutorial
for more details. The tutorial has separate sections for the Web Designer,
the System Architect and the Programmer.


How is WebStringTemplates different from other 'template engines'?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
WebStringTemplates allows the System Architect to define a Data Interface
Definition between the Programmer and the Web Page Designer which they both
work to. WebStringTemplates is also easy to use. Web Designers do not have
to learn another language. They don't need access to a running server and
they can use their existing tools to develop their pages. For Programmers,
the small number of classes, detailed tutorial and built-in debugging makes
them productive faster. For the Programmer, WebStringTemplates also provides
extendable data filters to handle html escape sequences and other data
transformation requirements.


WebStringTemplate Features
-------------------------------------------------

WebStringTemplates For the Web Page Designer

A clean, clearly defined and commented Data Interface Definition file in
HTML format.
All the data is in pre-formatted strings, no programming needed.
A few simple template commands that are quick and easy to use.
An interactive design tool to help develop the templates and check the
results. No need to continually go back to the programmer to test the
results. No need to have access to a servlet server to develop the web
pages.
Work with your existing HTML editing tools on your own machine.
Deliver a result that you know fits the programming specification.
Simple documentation with detailed examples.

WebStringTemplates For the System Architect

A Data Interface Definition file that provides a means of defining and
controlling the project without limiting the creativity of either the Web
Page Designer or the Programmer.
Insert comment fields in the data definition to describe its format and use.
Supports internationalization of templates and data.
Caching of templates and data for increased performance.
The clear clean interface definition makes project definition compliance a
yes/no question.
Allows you to concentrate on the data flow without worrying about the code
or page layout.
Not tightly bound to the server, can be added to any servlet server so it
does not limit your choices.

WebStringTemplates For the Programmer

A means to get rid of all that messy HTML code and to be able to concentrate
on implementing the business rules and generating the required data.
The Data Interface Definition file makes it easy to check when the job is
finished.
Extendible Data Filters to automate data transformations such as escaping <
>.
Introspection to extract data from Java Beans and flexible handling of
arrays and maps simplifies programming.
Extensive debugging features let you see what will be passed to the
template.

Subject: [antlr-interest] caching AST and parsed information
Message-ID: <buistf+9p54@eGroups.com>

Hi,

I am using antlr to instrument multiple (small) C-files automatically
with Monty's C-grammar.

Now I have the problem that all of my C-files include a file called
"temp.h" in which some macros are defined and which includes some
other project specific .h-files and some standard .h-files (eg.
stdio.h, math.h, ...). Because of the macros and typedefs in the
project-specific .h-files I am using a preprocessor before parsing
with antlr and I am getting very large files because of all the
includes, mainly the standard .h-files. Therefore parsing those files
is very slow.

Now my thoughts are: as all of my C-files only include this single
.h-file, I could possibly parse the temp.h file first and then cache
all the informations, antlr has parsed up to this point. After that I
could parse my c-files directly without using a preprocessor before
and ignoring the #include "temp.h"-directive.

How could I do that? Is this possible with antlr?

Thanks,
Daniel Raichle

Subject: [antlr-interest] Referencing Tokens in Lexer Rules?
Message-ID: <20040120170203.39288.qmail@web12702.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to reference a token in a lexer rule and
ANTLR is complaining.  Imagine I've got this:

tokens
{
  MYTOKEN = "foobar";
}

MYRULE: MYTOKEN NEWLINE
  ;

NEWLINE: 
  '\r' '\n'
|
 '\n'
;

When I try to build my lexer ANTLR complains that
there is no definition of rule mMYTOKEN.  Is there
some way to do what I'm trying to do?  If not, is it
because what I"m trying to do doesn't make sense? 
Thank in advance for any replies!

-jason

   True, which is why many suggest avoiding Python lambdas. However,
you can do the same thing with methods (or even bound methods) in a
dictionary, which should give you all the power you need.

What happens is that "foobar" is first identified as an "ID" token (or
whatever you call the rule for matching text tokens), then looked up
in a hash table and assigned the value MYTOKEN.  There is no mMYTOKEN
method generated.

You can explicitly identify "foobar" NEWLINE in your ID rule using a
syntactic predicate (relatively low overhead; the syntactic predicate
will only execute if 'f' is matched first at a minimum) and then
assign it a MYRULE token type.

Message-ID: <C7FE35004D40FD45AA342991B88CE40409ACDF@lnml1.eca-international.local>

Help! I'm sure there must be a simple option for this ...

statement_line : (statement ( SEMI! statement)* ) ;
statement : ( ifst ) ;
ifst : ( "IF"^ expr THEN statement_line );

So, statement_line can itself contain a statement_line, and antlr is
objecting that when it hits the SEMI, it's non-deterministic, and
presumably it doesn't know which statement_line the next statement
belongs to. How do I tell the parser that the lowest-level
statement_line is to be greedy and consume all statements until it hits
something (such as an EOL) that doesn't parse as part of the
statement_line.

Cheers,
Wol

Subject: [antlr-interest] Lexer grammar design issue
Message-ID: <20040121163236.5480.qmail@web12703.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I"m in the process of converting a large Lex/Yacc pair
of grammars to ANTLR.  I've spent a couple days
playing with ANTLR and the ANTLR documentation.  So
far I like it quite a bit, but I am having some
troubles wrapping my head around the lexer.  The Lex
grammar I'm 'converting' defines about 200 tokens and
makes considerable use of Lex's state mechanism.  For
example, there are over a hundred lines which look
something like the following:

<STATE1, STATE2>mytoken { myMethod( ) // My method may
or may not just return the literal token }

The ANTLR documentation recommends using Semantic
Predicates to simulate DFA based lexical states.  I
would like to do something like this:

MYTOKEN:{this.state == STATE1 || this.state == STATE2}

where MYTOKEN is a rule which matches the literal
'mytoken.'  Unfortunately, it seems that ANTLR doesn't
generate rules corresponding to literals.  I realize I
could push this logic into the Parser but I'd rather
not have to - there is enough going on there already
:)  Is there something I'm missing?  If anyone could
offer any suggestions, I'd really appreciate it.

You might also have a look at some of the (bigger) examples.

We also have token stream multiplexing to mimick some lexer state stuffs.

I presume you mean for entries in the tokens section? The tokens section
works in combination with the testLiterals option. Usualy you have some
rule that recognizes all id's and set testLiterals to true (and have it
turned of for the rest of the lexer):

IDENTIFIER options { testLiterals = true; }:
        ( 'a' .. 'z' | 'A' .. 'Z' | '_' )
        ( 'a' .. 'z' | 'A' .. 'Z' | '0'..'9' | '_' )*

Whenever an IDENTIFIER is matched the match is first checked against the
literals table and if it matches an entry that literal is returned in stead
of IDENTIFIER.

Have a look at the multiLexer example for tokenstream multiplexing. Basic
idea is that in the lexer upon encountering a specific start token one
switches to a lexer that is better suited to deal with that type of token,
and switch back to the calling lexer when the 'close' token is encountered.
The example uses this to deal with java doc comments. But you could also
use it for exotic string formats or whatever.

Cheers,

Ric

Just use your own Token subclass.  It's in the documentation and probably in
an example somewhere.  For instance the gcc grammar has a CToken object with
some extra info in it like filename.  http://www.codetransform.com/gcc.html

Hi all,

I have a lexer rule that lexes a complicated token, and I would like 
to process it, and put the results into an arbitrary Object and then
pass the object to the parser rule that uses the token.  Protected 
lexer rules can return something, but public ones can not.

How can I do this?  The antlr.Token class does not have a #setObject
(Object) method.  And I do not want to use a static Object in the 
Lexer/Parser.

   If it generates C# parser code, do you know how to write a build

Try using the greedy=true option and it will make antlr shut up :)

Subject: [antlr-interest] putting an Object into a token
Message-ID: <bumh9p+fds2@eGroups.com>

Hi all,

I have a lexer rule that lexes a complicated token, and I would like 
to process it, and put the results into an arbitrary Object and then
pass the object to the parser rule that uses the token.  Protected 
lexer rules can return something, but public ones can not.

How can I do this?  The antlr.Token class does not have a #setObject
(Object) method.  And I do not want to use a static Object in the 
Lexer/Parser.

I took a look at the grammar and I did not find the "language = "CSharp"
directive at the options. So I think by default a java parser will be
generated.

Well, I simply do somthing like:

(if you're using Mono and Unix, inside a terminal): mcs
/r:antlr.runtime.dll /out:my.exe all-generated-files-by-antlr

Or if you're using MS .Net, change mcs for csc

Hope it helps.

This is certainly possible.  Of course this won't help much if your .c files
actually use the macros defined in the temp.h file.  But it's easy to write
a rule that parses the #include and then builds a whole copy of the
previously parsed tree.  

Another approach would be to recognize the #file directives and do something
smart like parse and checksum the whole section contributed by  "temp.h"
When lexing the next file first just read thru and checksum the section and
if it already exists just use it out of the cache (from the parser--just
pass a special token back from the lexer which represents the whole section
and which the parser will replace with the cached tree.)

Subject: [antlr-interest] caching AST and parsed information

Hi,

I am using antlr to instrument multiple (small) C-files automatically
with Monty's C-grammar.

Now I have the problem that all of my C-files include a file called
"temp.h" in which some macros are defined and which includes some
other project specific .h-files and some standard .h-files (eg.
stdio.h, math.h, ...). Because of the macros and typedefs in the
project-specific .h-files I am using a preprocessor before parsing
with antlr and I am getting very large files because of all the
includes, mainly the standard .h-files. Therefore parsing those files
is very slow.

Now my thoughts are: as all of my C-files only include this single
.h-file, I could possibly parse the temp.h file first and then cache
all the informations, antlr has parsed up to this point. After that I
could parse my c-files directly without using a preprocessor before
and ignoring the #include "temp.h"-directive.

How could I do that? Is this possible with antlr?

Thanks,
Daniel Raichle

Hi :)

You can derive a new class with your required fields and then tell 
antlr to create tokens of that type. :)  It's setTokenClass or some 
such method on the lexer/parser.

  Hi, 

Thanks for your reply. What I did is specify the language option to 
CSharp. Could you please tell me which command will make the antlr 
read the gramma file and generated CSharp parser? 

  I take a look of those examples in the C# examples section, seem 
that they still use the following command:
   java -classpath <antlr path> antlr.Tool <grammar file>

However, it gives me errors. 

My believe is your suggestion "csc /r:antlr.runtime.dll /out:my.exe 
all-generated-files-by-antlr" is to compile those generated class 
rather to make antlr generate the Lexer, parser ...in C#.

  Thanks a lot for your help.

This doesn't help.  Aside from this, the documentation
states that this option is on by default anyway.

The code generated for the expression rule is:

	public final void expression() throws
RecognitionException, TokenStreamException {
		
		
		simpleExpression();
		{
		switch ( LA(1)) {
		case LITERAL_is:
		{
			match(LITERAL_is);
			match(LITERAL_null);
			break;
		}
		case RParen:
		{
			break;
		}
		default:
		{
			throw new NoViableAltException(LT(1),
getFilename());
		}
		}
		}
	}

This code seems to be requiring a RParen token or the
"is null" to be following the simpleExpression,
otherwise an error is thrown.  I would think that if
the "is null" were optional, then the default case
should be removed.

Ok, that's right it won't help if I'm parsing the .c files which still
contain macros. I didn't think abaout that.

But the other approach sounds very interesting. How would I have to
change the lexer so that reads through the whole section and builds
the checksum before passing the tokens to the parser? What about
typedefs in this section, would I have to cache the symbol table, too?

Thank you for your help!

For starters try:

expression 
:	simpleExpression ("is" "null")? EOF 
;

This of course will only work for input with a single expression followed
by end of file. If you want it to stop parsing after one expression leaving
the rest of the stream untouched then it won't work :/

Intuitively I wouldn't expect the throw in the generated code.... But my
intuition might be wrong ;)

Come to think of it you could also cheat by adding a dummy rule:

cheat: expression . ;

This will only bomb if it encounters unknown tokens...

Oh yeah, typedefs & symbol table stuff would have to be cached for sure.
You're right about the lexer, you have to have it read through the whole
section and pass a token to the parser that triggers the parser to duplicate
the actions that would have happened--that means building the tree and
updating the symbol table.  The other thing that theoretically could get
screwed up is the stack, but hopefully the included files don't actually end
in the middle of a declaration.  

Let me know how it goes.

Ok, that's right it won't help if I'm parsing the .c files which still
contain macros. I didn't think abaout that.

But the other approach sounds very interesting. How would I have to
change the lexer so that reads through the whole section and builds
the checksum before passing the tokens to the parser? What about
typedefs in this section, would I have to cache the symbol table, too?

Thank you for your help!

Subject: [antlr-interest] Help on error handling in antlr grammar...
Message-ID: <buqgg1+7lbg@eGroups.com>

Hi,
I'm using ANTLR for validating the user entered commands in command
line interface (CLI).

One sample of the command is "edit logsettings logid [{emaildest}]".
{} means that it can be an array list seperated with ',' (comma) & []
means that 
the parameter is optional.
'logid' will take any of the digit & 'emaildest' will take an email id
as its value.

I need to handle the error situations & have to show appropriate error
message to the user.
Here are the different kind of errors that can be produced as a result
of the command.

Success Cases:

1. I/P: edit logsettings logid = 123

2. I/P: edit logsettings logid = 123 emaildest = 
vamsikp406@kiwibox.com


Failure Cases:

1. I/P: edit logsettings
   O/P: logid parameter missing.

2. I/P: edit logsettings logid = 2a
   O/P: logid value invalid.

3. I/P: edit logsettings abcd logid = 123
   O/P: abcd parameter unknown.

4. I/P: edit logsettings logid = 123 emaildest = .vamsikp@kiwibox.com
   O/P: emaildest value invalid.

5. I/P: edit logsettings logid = 123 emaildest = vamsikp@kiwibox.com
logid = 234
   O/P: logid parameter repeated.

The grammar file that I had written for the command is given below.

With this, I'm getting non-determinism errors due to the last rule
(ID). So error handling is not complete.
And for some commands, the value of a parameter can contain the white
spaces also that needs to be taken for value.
Can anyone help me out what could be the better way to handle the 
above mentioned errors. It's very urgent for me.

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Vamsi.

Hi Stan,

I think this has something to do with the LA-sets analysis in the 
recursively referencing rules. The problem, as I see it, is that 
ANTLR should somehow find out where to start with the analysis (a 
root or top-level rule). And obviously this is not easy if you have 
nothing else but two mutually referencing rules in the grammar.

Unfortunately ANTLR does not complain about it but obviously it will 
surface during debugging, depending on what your top-level rule 
called from the main function is.

My hint here is to create a helper rule showing ANTLR unambiguously 
it is the one:

helper_expression: expression;

HTH,
Lubos.

Message-ID: <EA999391-4ECB-11D8-8977-000A956C550E@xs4all.nl>

In the NetRexx language, when a string is used as a variable, it cannot 
be a keyword anymore.  This is a great feature, and it comes out of the 
real life experience that newly added keywords in most environments 
(languages and toolkits) break existing programs. Now I've read about 
(and used a bit) the keywords literals feature of Antlr, but I am at a 
loss of how to specify the NetRexx behaviour in a grammar. Does anyone 
have any pointers on how to implement such a feature, if I were to, 
ahem, for example trying to make an antlr grammar for NetRexx?

For this one, you want to avoid ANTLR's keyword feature and use
semantic predicates instead.  Where you would have placed a keyword
"key", use
{ LA(1) == "key" }? NAME
(where NAME is the generic token type for identifiers in this example)
and then elaborate on the predicate code to handle the behavior you
describe.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Problem with C++ files: BaseAST.cpp
Message-ID: <bv31n4+5i86@eGroups.com>

Trying to port the GDL project
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnudatalanguage/) to windows, a
colleague found the following (ANTLR 2.7.2, C++ mode):

in BaseAST.cpp line 312:

ANTLR_API AST* const nullASTptr=0;

has to be changed to:

AST* const nullASTptr=0;

because:
"the __declspec should appear only in the declaration."
(MSVC)

Shouldn't this be changed in the original ANTLR distribution also?

Greetings,
marc

What MSVC version ? He's using a DLL build ? Anycase I recall that this was
needed for some MSVC version once. Would have to check about when this
entered the codebase.

Note: I don't have access to MSVC compilers so I'm carefull changing stuff
for it especially with 2.7.3 coming out soon. It might be helpfull if he
tried the prerelease of 2.7.3 or the latest snapshot as well (although the
same line of code is in it, but it might have some fixes for config.hpp,
don't have time to check at the moment).

Cheers,

Ric

Subject: [antlr-interest] problem parsing numbers
Message-ID: <bv34um+3t7g@eGroups.com>

Hi everyone,

A typical newbie question: the following grammar won't parse numbers 
correctly (for ex. give 123.456). I have simplified the grammar to 
the extreme to show only the number problem.

class ExpressionLexer extends Lexer;
options {
    k = 2; // needed for newline stuff
    filter = true; 
    charVocabulary='\3'..'\177';  // allow ASCII
}

tokens {
    LONG;
}
 
PLUS   : '+' ;
MINUS  : '-' ;

protected
DIGIT
	:	'0'..'9'
	;

protected
EXPONENT
	:	('e' | 'E') ('+' | '-')? (DIGIT)+
	;

NUMBER
    :   ( (DIGIT)+ ('.' | 'e' | 'E') )=> (DIGIT)+ ( '.' (DIGIT)* 
(EXPONENT)? | EXPONENT	)
	|	'.'	(DIGIT)+ (EXPONENT)?
	|	'0' ('0'..'7')* {_ttype = LONG;}
	|	'1'..'9' (DIGIT)* {_ttype = LONG;}
	|	'0' ('x' | 'X') ('a'..'f' | 'A'..'F' | DIGIT)+ 
{_ttype = LONG;}
	;

// Whitespace -- ignored
WS	:	(	' '
		|	'\t'
		|	'\f'
			// handle newlines
		|	(	options {generateAmbigWarnings=false;}
			:	"\r\n"  // Evil DOS
			|	'\r'    // Macintosh
			|	'\n'    // Unix (the right way)
			)
			{ newline(); }
		)+
		{ _ttype = Token.SKIP; }
	;

{import java.lang.Math;}
class ExpressionParser extends Parser;
options 
{ 
    buildAST=false; 
	exportVocab=Eval;
}

statement returns [double r = 0]
    : r=constant
    ;

constant returns [double r = 0]
	:	n:NUMBER {r=Double.parseDouble(n.getText());}
	|	l:LONG {r=Long.parseLong(l.getText());}
	;

Message-ID: <Sea1-F145UWhn65DWG6000043cd@hotmail.com>

Hi,

In the next 2.7.3 version of ANTLR could nextMonitoredToken be declared 
protected? I'm designing an XMLTokenStreamHiddenTokenFilter that extends 
from it (basically skips whole XML elements) and it needs to modify 
nextMonitoredToken.

Could this change be incorporated?

Thanks!

Arg..

After thinking over it, I may have a solution by redeclaring 
nextMonitoredToken in the extended class. If this works, then 
nextMonitoredToken would not need to be protected after all.

Actually that would be LT(1).getText()=="key".

Thanks for the correction.  It is a bit unfortunate that ANTLR 2 does not h=
oist semantic predicates--I found keyword resolution through 
semantic predicates very helpful with PCCTS.  I probably should also mentio=
n that Rene will find it desirable to insert syntactic 
predicates before (some/many?) invocations of rules that use keyword sem pr=
eds--otherwise the calling rule tests for NAME without 
checking if that NAME is "key".  Good thing Ter's looking to support sem pr=
ed hoisting in ANTLR 3!

I wrote an asp parser where activeX objects may have methods which can be 
keywords for the language.
To solve the problem, I declared the tokens for each keyword in the tokens 
section, and populated a Map with keyword's text as the key, and an Integer 
having the value for the corresponding token.
Exmaple:
map.put("for", new Integer(FOR));
Then from the lexer, when the IDENTIFIER rule is matched, I would search in the 
map if a key with that text exists.If it did, the value corresponding to that 
key was assigned as the token type.Otherwise the Token would be an IDENTIFIER.

When doing multilexing is there any way to avoid having the master 
parser consume the token in its grammar rule that invokes the slave 
parser?  It would be much simpler in my situation to process this 
token with the slave parser grammar.

Try overriding consume() (inherited from LLkParser).  The other
relevant methods are "match" and "matchNot" (inherited from Parser).

Loring, 

Okay, I'm finally back to my parser.  Thanks for
taking the time to reply.  The syntactic predicate
solution would be a good one if it weren't for the
fact that I've actually got a couple of hundred tokens
rather than just a few.  Maybe it still is, I'll have
to do some more research.  In any case, thinks for the
push in the right direction.

Message-ID: <20040127182904.93858.qmail@web12701.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I'm just run antlr agains a yacc grammar and it
generated hundreds of 'infinite recursion' errors. 
I've spent quite a bit of time on the ANTLR site
(which is excellent by the way) and I'm trying to wrap
my head around all of this stuff.  I understand that
the errors are generated because ANTLR parses top down
so can't handle the Left Hand Recursion which is
common in YACC grammars.  I can convert the LHR for
the simple case which only involves one rule but am at
a bit of a loss to handle the following which is a
much simplified version of a piece of my grammar:

startRule: 
  dimentia;

dimentia:
  gentle | "FOO";

gentle:
  "BAR" | dimentia;

which produces 3 infinite recursion errors.  I
understand the problem but it's not clear to me how to
fix it :)

On a related note - I've noticed that ANTLR doesn't
complain about the following grammar:

startRule:
  dimentia;

dimentia:
  gentle;

gentle:
  dimentia;

Though when I look at the generated parser it seems as
though it would obviously be infinitely recursive. 
Just wondering.  Thanks in advance for any replies!

Seems to me it's

Perhaps with an action to ensure that at least one matched.

In-Reply-To: <bv66g7+uadc@eGroups.com>
Message-ID: <bv6e2q+cjhh@eGroups.com>

I wrote one a few years back in PCCTS (actually a subset parser for extracting information from a specification document).  Microsoft 
keeps an up-to-date spec including grammar--look up "RTF" with their search engine.  You'll want a lexer rule to identify keywords 
(anything that looks like   '/' (A..Z | a..z)+ (0-9)* ), keep them in a symbol table with the numbers of arguments for each symbol (I had 
a separate specification grammar to distinguish between keywords with one or two arguments), and use semantic predicates to deal 
with keyword-dependent alternatives.

So, yes it can be done with ANTLR.  I relied heavily on semantic predicate hoisting, so there may be a bit more pain with ANTLR 2.

Subject: [antlr-interest] sql parser
Message-ID: <bv6b7o+or75@eGroups.com>

Hi,

I am writing a sql parser similar to the Microsoft SELECT example on 
the antlr website.  I have a very complicated query (several pages) 
that just hangs the parser.

It has many sql IN statements
i.e.

SELECT 1 FROM bar WHERE foo IN (SELECT 1 FROM bar WHERE foo IN ( ... 
etc etc etc)

so the IN clause can go on forever

The main grammar of the IN clause is

IN LPAREN (
                (selectStatement) => selectStatement
              | expression (COMMA expression)*
              ) RPAREN

the syntatic predicate is needed because both the selectStatment & 
expression rule can start with a LPAREN

any ideas?

Subject: [antlr-interest] Parsing beginners question
Message-ID: <bv7mao+pff5@eGroups.com>

Hi,
Sorry to bother you with what will undoubtably turn out to be a dumb question, but I'm not closing in on the problem so thought I'd ask.

I'm trying to get the cgram (the 'C' grammer) code to run in CPP mode.  For now I am only building the StdCParser.g file 
which I modified by commenting out all Java code, changing the options and header files etc.  It builds okay (I think)
under VC6.0 and kind of runs (it accepts an input file and displays errors).

If the input file is:

double i;
int j;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
	{
	i = j + 3;
	}

it doesn't like it, giving this error:
unexpected token: double

In trying to debug the code I find that it drops down through:
translationUnit,
externalList,
and gets to externalDef where it fails here:

	try {      // for error handling
	if ((_tokenSet_2.member(LA(1))) && (_tokenSet_3.member(LA(2)))) {
		declaration();
		if (inputState->guessing==0) {
		astFactory->addASTChild( currentAST, returnAST );
		}
	externalDef_AST = currentAST.root;

It never drops down into declaration.  Somehow _tokenSet_3.member(LA(2)))) winds up being false.  
I've checked the incoming token stream from StdCLexer.cpp and it seems like what I would expect,
but somehow this code in StdCParser.cpp seems to be getting the wrong tokens, or something.

Incidently, I replaced ": ("typedef" | declaration)=> declaration" with simply "declaration", thinking the problem 
might be there so the parser code in part is:

translationUnit
        :       externalList

        |       /* Empty source files are *not* allowed.  */
                {
                //System.err.println ( "Empty source file!" );
                }
        ;

externalList
        :       ( externalDef )+
        ;

externalDef
/*        :       ( "typedef" | declaration )=> declaration */
		: declaration
        |       functionDef
        |       asm_expr
        ;

I know that cgram (in Java mode) has been thoroughly checked out, so I've done something wrong. 

Thank you in advance for any help,

Henry

You can use the option codeGenBitsetTestThreshold = 999999; in order to turn
off the bitset generation and be able to see the actual tokens it is trying
to match.  Also, have you run it through antlr with the -trace option?  That
could help with debugging too.

Actually you do need that syntactic predicate ": ("typedef" | declaration)=>
declaration".  The parser doesn't know if it is looking at a declaration or
definition until it sees the semicolon which can be very far (undefined,
unbounded length) into the file.

Message-ID: <Sea1-F40pevdxoX8JPk00029e72@hotmail.com>

Hi everyone, mostly Terence.

I will greatly need your help on this one. I have a grammar (that uses XPA) 
and, listen to this, I sometimes get a grammar error, and sometimes not by 
executing the same command line with the same input.

Here is what happens:

$ java -cp 
"/usr/local/soft/antlr-2.7.2/lib/antlr.jar:/usr/local/soft/xpa-1.0.1/lib/xpa1_0_1-full.jar:.:Code"

$ java -cp

line 3: expecting "<IdOfRegulation>", found 'TitleOfAct'

$ java -cp

MainRegulationParser tmp/Fr/C.R.C.,_c._100.06-MTE.html > /tmp/g

$

I tried adding those options like so:
java -classpath %CLASSPATH% antlr.Tool -trace -codeGenBitsetTestThreshold=999999 $(InputPath),
which I ran on the StdCParser.g file.

The only difference that I see is that I now have a bunch of Tracer TraceInOut() calls in the .cpp file,
which I assume was due to the -trace flag.  What should the effect of the 999999 flag be,
and where should I see it?

Also, if you have a moment, could you tell me what the Bitset thing is all about?
In going through source the StdCParser.cpp file last night I noticed several _tokenSet_* arrays containing 
unsigned long quantities that I didn't understand.  Are these related to the Bitset's you are referring to?

Thanks for your help!

Thanks for your help on this.  It turns out that I made some errors in converting the lexer from java to cpp.
I fixed one pertaining to whitespace and that cleared up much of the problem.  The -trace option is great!

Daniel--

Try another JDK.  There is no antlr state preserved between invocations, so your problem must be java-related state--something isn't 
getting cleaned up properly.

Bitsets are a compact representation of a set of token numbers--exactly what
antlr needs to test for lookahead.  Setting the codeGenBitsetTestThreshold
tells antlr to switch from simple "==" tests to using bitsets when the
number of tokens to be tested is at or above the threshold.

Hi everyone, mostly Terence.

I will greatly need your help on this one. I have a grammar (that uses XPA) 
and, listen to this, I sometimes get a grammar error, and sometimes not by 
executing the same command line with the same input.

Here is what happens:

$ java -cp 
"/usr/local/soft/antlr-2.7.2/lib/antlr.jar:/usr/local/soft/xpa-1.0.1/lib/xpa
1_0_1-full.jar:.:Code"

$ java -cp 
"/usr/local/soft/antlr-2.7.2/lib/antlr.jar:/usr/local/soft/xpa-1.0.1/lib/xpa
1_0_1-full.jar:.:Code" 
MainRegulationParser tmp/Fr/C.R.C.,_c._100.06-MTE.html > /tmp/g

$ java -cp 
"/usr/local/soft/antlr-2.7.2/lib/antlr.jar:/usr/local/soft/xpa-1.0.1/lib/xpa
1_0_1-full.jar:.:Code" 
MainRegulationParser tmp/Fr/C.R.C.,_c._100.06-MTE.html > /tmp/g

$ java -cp 
"/usr/local/soft/antlr-2.7.2/lib/antlr.jar:/usr/local/soft/xpa-1.0.1/lib/xpa
1_0_1-full.jar:.:Code" 
MainRegulationParser tmp/Fr/C.R.C.,_c._100.06-MTE.html > /tmp/g
line 3: expecting "<IdOfRegulation>", found 'TitleOfAct'

$ java -cp 
"/usr/local/soft/antlr-2.7.2/lib/antlr.jar:/usr/local/soft/xpa-1.0.1/lib/xpa
1_0_1-full.jar:.:Code" 
MainRegulationParser tmp/Fr/C.R.C.,_c._100.06-MTE.html > /tmp/g

$

These invocation were done in sequence and the input file has not changed 
between invocations. I printed some debug out of ANTLR to show the sequence 
of tokens that have been read and in both cases the token sequence is the 
same.

Something is happening in ANTLR that is causing it to take a different path 
for what seems like a random reason.

This is really causing me a headache, and I can trace the problem to one 
rule I added in the grammar. If I remove this rule, then I do not get this 
strange behavior (BTW, the rule is simple, so I'm not doing anything tricky 
here). I really cannot see why this additionnal rule would break anything 
and specially not like this.

additionnal information? Do you want the java files/grammar so that you can 
run it on your setup see if it does the same? Would you like an ssh access 
to this linux machine to see for yourself? Do you think the bug arrises from

I'm running on Linux, RedHat 9 with the SUN JDK 1.4.2 for linux.

Subject: [antlr-interest] cgram and SEMI! usage
Message-ID: <bvbkc4+dldp@eGroups.com>

When I run a simple one line program:

double d;

through StdCParser and GnuCTreeParser displaying the nodes in the tree parser I get:

...

   < initDecl()
  < initDeclList()
<AST>: unexpected AST node: <ASTNULL>
 < declaration()
<externalDef()

This appears to occur because in StdCParser.g we have:

declaration
        { ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr)RefAST /*AST*/ ds1 = NULL; }
        :       ds:declSpecifiers       { ds1 = astFactory->dupList(#ds); }
                (                       
                    initDeclList[ds1]
                )?
                SEMI!
                                        { ## = #( #[NDeclaration], ##); }
        ;

Whereas in GnuCTreeParser.g we have:

declaration
        :       #( NDeclaration
                    declSpecifiers
                    (                   
                        initDeclList
                    )?
                    ( SEMI )+
                )
        ;

*************************

If I take out the ! after SEMI in the Parser .g file I don't get the error.
It would appear that the tree parser is expecting a SEMI AST, but the parser 
is not generating one.  Some other tree parser code that I've examined omits 
things like SEMI, so I'd appreciate some insight here.

Thank you in advance,

Henry

It looks like I did all my testing by combining GnuCParser and
GnuCTreeParser.  I should also test with StdCParser and GnuCTreeParser!  I'm
trying to remember why, but with Gnu C I needed to use SEMIs in the tree
more.  I would recommend changing the StdCParser as you have, by removing
the ! from the SEMIs when you see this.

Subject: [antlr-interest] cgram and SEMI! usage

When I run a simple one line program:

double d;

through StdCParser and GnuCTreeParser displaying the nodes in the tree
parser I get:

...

   < initDecl()
  < initDeclList()
<AST>: unexpected AST node: <ASTNULL>
 < declaration()
<externalDef()

This appears to occur because in StdCParser.g we have:

declaration
        { ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr)RefAST /*AST*/ ds1 = NULL; }
        :       ds:declSpecifiers       { ds1 = astFactory->dupList(#ds); }
                (                       
                    initDeclList[ds1]
                )?
                SEMI!
                                        { ## = #( #[NDeclaration], ##); }
        ;

Whereas in GnuCTreeParser.g we have:

declaration
        :       #( NDeclaration
                    declSpecifiers
                    (                   
                        initDeclList
                    )?
                    ( SEMI )+
                )
        ;

*************************

If I take out the ! after SEMI in the Parser .g file I don't get the error.
It would appear that the tree parser is expecting a SEMI AST, but the parser

is not generating one.  Some other tree parser code that I've examined omits

things like SEMI, so I'd appreciate some insight here.

Thank you in advance,

Henry

Hi Monty,

Well... I'm outa luck, after adding 2 or 3 rules to my grammar it 
seems like the bug doesnt show up anymore. This really looks like a 
java VM bug. In anycase, if this happens again I'll trace it and 
hope it behaves the same with the trace activated.

Yes, after posting, I thought to look at GnuCParser.g and sure enough the ! wasn't there.

It's probably not as simple as going through and replacing SEMI! with SEMI in StdCParser.g 
since SEMI! is used in some places in GnuCParser.g.  I guess I would have to look at it on a 
rule by rule basis.

Q. Do you think SEMI is the only token that might have this problem?  If so, I might just try 
to fix StdCParser.g.

On the otherhand, I wouldn't mind using GnuCParser.g, except that doing so about doubles my 
chances of making an error in going to CPP if I still have to worry about StdCParser.g.

Q. When one grammar (GnuCParser.g) extends another (StdCParser.g) does a particular rule in the 
new one (like rule declaration) completely replace the rule from the old one, or does it somehow inherit 
from the old one?  If GnuCParser.g pretty much replaces what's in StdCParser.g, then I will concentrate 
my efforts on GnuCParser.g.

Since I'm not well grounded yet on this, I would appreciate any suggestions.

And, thanks for your efforts on this grammar in the first place.

SEMI is probably the only token with this problem.  I'd check COMMA too.  

And yes, do it on a rule by rule basis.  

I would concentrate your efforts on the StdCParser.g.  If you start changing
GnuCParser.g then you will also have to change the tree parsers
GnuCTreeParser.g and GnuCTreeEmitter.g.

Grammar "inheritance" in antlr is really replacement at the rule level.
This is something we will address in antlr 3.

Hi guys,

I really can't believe this is a VM bug (although I just found an 
obvious one the other day, so, hmmmm, maybe). What I rather suspect is 
there is some sort of race. At least this is indicated by this 
undeterministic behavior. To have a race you need at least two threads 
running. As far as I know ANTLR is strictly single-threaded, right? But, 
trara, XPA is *not*. It uses a producer/consumer thing to give both SAX 
parser an ANTLR the impression they are the master of it all. Although 
this code is very simple, there might still be a bug in it. If you can 
give me any hint upon which conditions this error occurs, I would highly 
appreciate this.

Cheers,
Oliver

Yes, I'd like to keep it as simple as possible, but since there isn't a corresponding 
StdCTreeParser, how well matched are GnuCTreeParser.g and StdCParser.g? 
I don't plan on using GnuCTreeEmitter at all, the only concern is compatibility with 
GnuCTreeParser.  So, is the the StdCParser / GnuCTreeParser combo still my best bet?

How does the expandedGnuCParser.g relate to all of this?

Hello,

Imagine I've got the following rule:

memory:
  A B
  |
  memory C D
  | 
  E F G
  |
  H I J
  |
  memory K
  | 
  memory L
  |
  M N O
  ; 
which of course has multiple instances of infinite
recursion.  I've got ALOT of rules like this and I'm
converting them to something like this:
memory:
 (AB | EFG | HIJ | MNO) (CD)* (K)* (L)*
  ;


Does this seem reasonable?  Infinite recursion still
makes my head spin a bit.

I think your rule should be:

memory:
  ( A B | E F G | H I J | M N O ) ( C D | K | L )+
;

consider the string: A B K C D K L C D L K

your original, left-recursive, rule will accept this string;
while your translation will not.

try this:

1) rearrange terms

memory:
  ( A B | E F G | H I J | M N O )
  | memory C D 
  | memory K
  | memory L
;

2) left factor second thru last alternatives

memory:
  ( A B | E F G | H I J | M N O )
  | memory ( C D | K | L )
;

and now I hope you can see that the rule I suggest works better...

Hope this helps

Looks right, except I think you meant *, not +, on the second term:

   ( A B | E F G | H I J | M N O ) ( C D | K | L )*

Right?

Later,

It is: MSVC.NET 7.0.9466.

My colleague sorted the stuff now out, in config.hpp (line 41):

Before:
// For the DLL support contributed by Stephen Naughton
# ifdef ANTLR_EXPORTS
#	undef ANTLR_API
#	define ANTLR_API __declspec(dllexport)
# else
#	undef ANTLR_API
#	define ANTLR_API __declspec(dllimport)
# endif


Should be:
// For the DLL support contributed by Stephen Naughton
# ifdef ANTLR_EXPORTS
#    undef ANTLR_API
#    define ANTLR_API __declspec(dllexport)
# elif defined(ANTLR_IMPORTS)
#    undef ANTLR_API
#    define ANTLR_API __declspec(dllimport)
# else
#   undef ANTLR_API
#   define ANTLR_API
# endif

Without you get the following errors:
antlr\BaseAST.cpp(312) : error C2201: 'nullASTptr' : must have
external linkage in order to be exported/imported
antlr\TreeParser.cpp(39) : error C2491: 'antlr::TreeParser::ASTNULL' :

Where can I get 2.7.3?

Ack, that's the same fix that went into the the repository a while ago.

> Where can I get 2.7.3?

Looks like Terence didn't link it from the main antlr page. My latest
development snapshot from http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/antlr is
slightly newer than the 2.7.3rc1 version.

The official candidate is at:

http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-2.7.3rc1.tar.gz

I'm very interested in knowing how it behaves on MSVC compilers (if you
have time to also check the DLL build I'd be much obliged) I moved some
stuff around to get rid of a lot of the DLL related MSVC ifdefs all over
the code.

Cheers,

Ric

Yes, go with StdCParser / GnuCTreeParser combo unless you want to make your
own StdCTreeParser.g by pruning away the gnu stuff.  The idea was that the
trees from StdCTreeParser should work perfectly with GnuCTreeParser, so
fixing in StdCTreeParser would be the most help.

Yes, I'd like to keep it as simple as possible, but since there isn't a
corresponding 
StdCTreeParser, how well matched are GnuCTreeParser.g and StdCParser.g? 
I don't plan on using GnuCTreeEmitter at all, the only concern is
compatibility with 
GnuCTreeParser.  So, is the the StdCParser / GnuCTreeParser combo still my
best bet?

How does the expandedGnuCParser.g relate to all of this?

jbb,

Thanks, your answer was very informative.  The first
time I compared your sample input to my rule it seemed
it should work then I realized that was because I was
expecting left recursion after the 'K' was consumed. 
Doh!  In any case with the slight change Chris
suggests in his follow-up you're right on the money. 
Thanks again.

I just checked this and I guess it actually does not apply. As far as I 
know Daniel uses the XPA XML parser, not a SAX one to drive ANTLR, but 
this one is single-threaded. Thus it can't be a race and I am clueless 
as well...

Subject: [antlr-interest] help required: accessing intermediary output ASTs in tree parser
In-Reply-To: <401AD03B.6050009@zeigermann.de>
Message-ID: <BLECKPJHLDELKCDPMJLPOEDLCEAA.mail@sifraser.com>

I think I'm probably missing somthing obvious here, but please somebody 
point it out to me -- I'm getting incredibly frustrated! Consider the 
following tree parser:

start! : #(spec:SPECIFICATION (section|paragraph)+)
		{	// How do I refer to the children of SPECIFICATION 
			// that have been modified by the following rules?

			// If I use spec.getFirstChild() I get first child 
			// of original parse tree, and not the transformed
			// tree that has been created by the section/ 
			// paragraph rules

			// If I do (s:section|p:paragraph)+ then I only get
			// the reference to the last section/paragraph
			// created.
			
			// I'm assuming that there must be some way to refer
			// to the indiviual section/paragraphs matched and 
			// their associated trees. Having searched the docs.
			// etc. I can't it! Can anyone help me??
		}

section! : #(NAMED_SECTION NAME LEFTSQ FORMALS RIGHTSQ (paragraph)+)
		{	// Manual tree creation 
		}

paragraph! : #(GEN_SCH_PARA NAME schema_text END)
		{	// Manual tree creation 
		}
 etc....


Any help would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if I need to 
clarify what I'm asking (it's quite hard to express exactly what I want).

Cheers,
Si

It sounds like you have run into a few of the usual minor gotchas. 
First, you should be using #spec.getFirstChild() to refer to the
output AST's first child and #spec_in for the input AST.  The # is
important--#spec is translated to specAST and spec_in to spec (the
underscore may not be there--I'd have to check).  If you want manual
access to the ASTs created in a loop from outside the loop, you will
want to set references:

{ Stack x; }
(  p:paragraph  { x.push(p); } )+

and then use the Stack as a vector.  Alternatively, use another tree
pass to get at the fields.

Subject: [antlr-interest] C# lexer and unicode
Message-ID: <bvfa82+uj6d@eGroups.com>

I would like to know if ANTLR's C# parser generator supports unicode.
I have an input that contains some chinese/japanese identifiers and 
they are not being lexed properly. They are simply being skipped from 
the stream. They don't even show up in the lexer's nextToken() method.

I wonder if this is because there is something wrong in my lexer or 
just because it's not yet fully supported.

I have:

  charVocabulary = '\u0000'..'\ufffe';

Here's my whitespace rule:

// Whitespace -- ignored
WS      : ( options { generateAmbigWarnings = false; }
	  : ' '	// blank
	  | '\t'	// tab
	  | "\r\n"    	{newline();} // Windows
	  | ('\r'|'\n') {newline();} // Unix or Mac
	  | '\f'      // form feed
	  | ('\0'..'\10'|'\16'..'\37')  // control characters
	  ) {$setType(Token.SKIP);}
	;

Here's my rule for identifiers:

IDENT
options {testLiterals=true;
         paraphrase="an identifier";}
	: ('\u0080'..'\ufffe'|'a'..'z'|'_') 
('\u0080'..'\ufffe'|'a'..'z'|'_'|'$'|'0'..'9')*
	;

And here's the string I'm trying to parse:

???????? VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL

They work ok for me (for latin characters such as ?????) but the
input files must be UTF8 encoded.

Best wishes,

Anyway, that's the way it works for me because I use
System.IO.File.OpenText(string) to
get the StreamReader, but I'd bet you could create
a StreamReader() with the proper enconding to make it work...

Subject: [antlr-interest] using antlr to create HTML
Message-ID: <bvgkdb+ttqq@eGroups.com>

what i basically want is to read in a java file and create html file 
of code but depending on of what token is read, it sets different 
colours i.e. set all the word "class" to red etc
the ultimate goal is to make it easier for the user to read java code 
highlighting important keywords with colours. The HTML will be 
displayed in a Jpane.

is it possible? and how differicult is it to do?

thanks

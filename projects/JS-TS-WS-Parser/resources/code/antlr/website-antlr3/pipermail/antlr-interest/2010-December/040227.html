<PRE>Hi Alan,

Here is how we are doing it. Courtesy: Vaibhav Goel from our group.
&quot;
Traverse the AST and create CFG nodes and edges, taking special care for branching and looping constructs. For example, on
reaching an 'if' statement, create two separate routes for 'then' and 'else' blocks. Similarly, on reaching a 'for' statement,
create a back edge to account for looping.

Surely, this ab initio approach is lengthy and might also get a bit messy once
function calls are in place (which I have not considered for now).

However, I did not come across any alternative way of doing it for ANTLR on the net.
&quot;
Thanks,

Subject: [antlr-interest] Get a Control flow graph(CFG) from the AST

Hello Everyone!

 What I want to do is to get a control flow graph(CFG) from an AST, where each
statement or expression is a unique Node. I was wondering what you would suggest
as the best option to do that. Thanks!

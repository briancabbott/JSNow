&gt;<i> I had scanned the archives, but didn't see anything, so I looked again.
</I>&gt;<i> I see lots of talk about tree parsing, update on v2.8 and a reply to a

</I>&gt;<i> Is that what you were refering to?  I didn't see any update for 3,
</I>&gt;<i> roadmap or location for source or repository.  Is there something burried
</I>&gt;<i> in one of the other discussions?  Did you have some particular post in
</I>&gt;<i> mind?  (There doesn't seem to be a way to search the full-text of the
</I>&gt;<i> archives without downloading a tarball for each month seperately - is
</I>&gt;<i> there?)

(A) Alas, the search mechanism on the Antlr.org site doesn't (yet?) spider
the mailing list archives.  [The search seems to be particularly
problematic in that I just tried to use it and it gave me one page of
(useless) results without any way to get to any other pages. Ouch.]

(B) I just checked my personal archive of the mailing list but I only keep
a small subset of posts and I couldn't find the message I was thinking of.

(C) Antlr v3 is in the research and development phase so it's
definitely NOT yet ready for poking and prodding. It's really just Ter
hacking away and some of the cabal members beating him periodically.  Check
out the Antlr v3 weblog entries to see the thinking in progress.

(D) The idea is to have something that the adventurous can play with
available later this year.  Knowing Ter, I wouldn't expect it until the end
of the summer break. :-)

Hope this helps,
		John

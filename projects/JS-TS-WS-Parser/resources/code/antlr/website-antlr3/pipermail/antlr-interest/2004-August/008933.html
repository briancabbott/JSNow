Yes. Crazy stuff.

Sorry for getting late on the thread but have you already considered the 
idea of an action language?

By action language I mean a very simple language with basic constructs 
that could then be translated to whatever
language the generated parser will be in.

I don't know how you're planning code generation to be but maybe the 
asp.net codedom might serve you as a
good model?

asp.net pages too support multiple target languages and what they 
basically do there is to have the general asp.net parser
to just build an ast, the ast is then handled over to the appropriate 
language component that should then translate it
 to the apropriate source code form.

I understand this somewhat

&gt;<i>A special editor could help but I don't see that as a real option I

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I wouldnt use antlr if it required some sort of special editor and I 
guess most coders wouldnt as well.

&gt;<i>How many people are actively using one grammar cross language? Is this

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm just not using a cross language grammar because of the efforts 
involved. I'd love to be able to use my grammar
(target language is c#) as a start point to a java-based eclipse plugin 
but I cant (unless I use ikvm).

<PRE>Hi,

Now that I've managed, with lots of help from Tom B. and Wincent C., to 
get the ANTLRworks debugger working, two things come to mind:

1) The reason I started using ANTLR in the first place (I'd used JavaCC 
for years), was because I asked around about tool support for parser 
generators. Someone pointed out that ANTLR has this nice ANTLRworks 
thing, so I decided to give ANTLR a try. But I developed one whole 
parser without really exploiting ANTLRworks.

2) Wow! ANTLRworks is really very powerful and useful, once you scratch 
the surface and surmount some of its challenges.


Thanks to everyone who helped and, of course, to Ter and Jean.

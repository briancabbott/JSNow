Several actions, but only one that I have heard of -- Dutch, I thought -- 
that has actually come to a judicial decision.

&gt;<i>The court argued that even if

If I am not mistaken, you are referring to one of the preliminary motions 
-- interesting, but we will have to wait for something final.  And, of 
course you heard that many of our leading US Senators consider it 
high-treason for our Supreme Court justices to even read international 
court decisions.  Priceless ... (in the intellectually bankrupt sense).

Best,
Gerald

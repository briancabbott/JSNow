Understood. As I said to the poster of the previous VB-ish grammar,
&quot;please consider a less restrive license like the BSD&quot;.

I don't know much about any of the licenses, but I will look into it, I 
don't want to restrict it (but my boss has some input :) ).

&gt;<i> So yes I do, espically since I am getting free help, of course I

</I>
If you feel that way, then you should. 

&gt;<i> And for you question about &quot;it doesn't work&quot;, means I should have
</I>sent the 
&gt;<i> parser :).
</I>
No. Well, perhaps. &quot;No&quot; because I didn't know there was a parser. I
just couldn't understand how your lexer wasn't working hence my
request for input and messages.

&quot;Perhaps&quot; because, it a little difficult trying to help if I have no
idea of what's in your grammar. If the grammar needs to remain
confidential and you still need help, you should consider hiring a
skilled ANTLR/language design consultant. Just ask on the list.

I need to learn this for various reasons. I would love to get a tutorial 
from someone, but no $$$$$ and this is what I am paid to do.  So trial by 
fire(antlr)!

&gt;<i> I am climbing the newbie hump with Antlr and still trying to 
</I>&gt;<i> learn how to describe things I see.  In this case it means the program 
</I>&gt;<i> terminated (back to a prompt).
</I>
Don't sound like not working to me. End of input maybe?. Unless you
meant to say it terminated abruptly (i.e. crashed, stack-tracked,
core-dump or similar).

Are you building an AST yet?. Look at the Java grammar sample - if you
are developing in C# or Java - for an example of how to display this
AST in an ASTFrame.

Not yet but I am looking at other grammars for ideas.

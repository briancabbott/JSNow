I did not really look too deep into this, it will depend I guess. Lugging
whole boost around seems to me excessive anycase.

</I>
When debugging antlr stuff I usually completely rely on tracing in stead of
gdb. Probably half my debug sessions with gdb and gcc 3 generated code end
in a sigsegv of gdb. (Used to be worse when I still worked on sparc's that
was about the worst thing you could do) Then again easily enabled/disabled
tracing code is never a bad thing to have ;)

Cheers,

Ric

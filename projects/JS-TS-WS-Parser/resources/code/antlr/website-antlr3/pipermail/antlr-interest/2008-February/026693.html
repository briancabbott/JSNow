<PRE>Mr. Token, if I understand you correctly, you want to create your
own scripting language, and then translate that language into some
other programming
language. Note that a custom scripting language is *not* the same as
pseudocode, since &quot;pseudocode&quot;, by definition, is non-standardized and
vague. It's the difference between the mathmatical equation &quot;X=Y+Z&quot; and
someone writing on a sticky-note: &quot;I think X should be Y plus whatever that
thing was from before.&quot;

Yes, ANTLR makes it much easier for you to do that than it would be by
hand. If your new language is very similar to an existing one (e.g.
Pascal) you can try to find an
ANTLR grammar file someone else might already have made and modify
that. Otherwise you will need to write your own grammar file.

And after *that* you will need to figure out how blocks of your scripting
language turn into blocks of another language, and program those in.

<PRE>Gavin,

Thanks, that makes perfect sense.  It's certainly better than what I  
was trying to do with a HashMap.  I think I'm thinking about this  
more clearly now.

I understand the idea, but I can't seem to implement it.  I have a  
&quot;PragmaInclude&quot; lexer rule that reads each include statement and  
switches the input stream to the new file.  It works.  I'd like to do  
what you suggest, and access the PragmaInclude token in the parser,  
so the parser can see the file name.  The odd thing is that the lexer  
doesn't seem to generate a PragmaInclude token.

Attached is the grammar.  In it, the &quot;compilerDirective&quot; parser rule  
uses the PragmaInclude token.  I couldn't get compilerDirective to  
&quot;fire&quot; while parsing.  I discovered that I could comment the  
compilerDirective rule completely and the translator would still  
behave the same.  It seems to me that the lexer never creates a  
PragmaInclude token, even though the PragmaInclude definitely executes.

What am I missing?

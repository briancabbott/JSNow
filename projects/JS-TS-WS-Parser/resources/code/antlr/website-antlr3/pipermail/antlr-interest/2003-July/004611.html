In my mental model, there are perhaps four issues involved here:

1) Should the attributes listed above be supported as standard for 
*all* ANTLR tokens and AST nodes?

==&gt; &quot;Yes&quot; would be my answer on this. I can't think of a project 
where I haven't needed this. &quot;filename&quot; might 
become &quot;resourceLocation&quot; or similar if support for sources other 
than files (e.g zip archives, urls etc) is added.

2) How can ANTLR [grammars] be extended to support declarative custom 
AST-node-attributes specification in a language-neutral manner?

==&gt; Have to think about this a bit. Support for both homogenous and 
heterogenous trees makes this a little tricky.

3) Should ANTLR support custom token-attributes and how?

==&gt; I haven't needed to do this except to add filename/line/col info. 
What do people think?.

4) How can we ensure that implementation decisions like &quot;should I 
store line/col info in two 32-bit ints or a single int?&quot; are properly 
left to ANTLR codegens?

==&gt; This really needs head banging together to thrash stuff out. 
Would we end up with a set of interfaces each for OO, IMP, FP etc 
language families?

&gt;<i> At NeXT I had to encode token type and line number into a 32 bit

&gt;<i> but in other cases it had to be an object.  The code generator

&gt;<i> generate either depending on options and what attributes you had in

</I>
Cool. Seems you already have a jump on (4) above.

&gt;<i> Just some thoughts we had.  We're thinking about language

&gt;<i> pretty heavily since I expect to make building a code generator for

</I>
Hopefully not so easy that the codegens aren't able to make often 
drastic implementation decisions as above. Actually, we could have a 
two-tier system:
TIER-1: The set of codegen interfaces that result from (4) above 
would support the development of fully integrated ANTLR codegens that 
require more work to build but in return produce the 
fastest/smallest/tighest[/prettiest?] code.
TIER-2: The intermediate form that you describe below on the other 
hand could allow anyone to build a very decent codegen in record time.

&gt;<i> Lots of back ends will appear I hope.  I'm going to 
</I>&gt;<i> go so far as to have a text-based intermediate form (if wanted) so 
</I>that 
&gt;<i> you don't even have to build the code generator in ANTLR.  You 
</I>could 
&gt;<i> build the python code generator in python for example as it's just 
</I>&gt;<i> reading a text file with all the &quot;hard parts&quot; filled in :)

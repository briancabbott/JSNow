<PRE>Hi All,

 

I feel somewhat humbled by the expert advice that cam in reply to my
design workflow question I am not that far in the process yet to play
with the trees and all that. 

 

What I wondered is if there is a way to get some kind of result or
parsing exception thrown my the parser.entryPointMethod() call? I admit
that this may be a typical case of &#8220;if all you have is a hammer
everything looks like a nail&#8221; but &#8230; I&#8217;m learning.

 

Trying to figure out how to build a rather large compiler/evaluator
Content MathML I like to go in little steps. E.g. first doing a large
structure thing proper nesting of the elements&#8230; then putting in
attributes, then handling proper data type management&#8230; I haven&#8217;t figured
out a better way to go through the motions yet.

 

Now what I would like to do is build my whole suite of UnitTests for the
various rules in my parser/compiler/evaluator:

e.g. 

testAPass - Parsing a unary operator apply-element:
&lt;apply&gt;&lt;factorial/&gt;&lt;cn&gt;4&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;

testBPass- Parsing a binary operator apply-element:
&lt;apply&gt;&lt;plus/&gt;&lt;cn&gt;4&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;cn&gt;3&lt;/cn&gt;&lt;/apply&gt;

testAFail &#8230;

..etc..

 

As I progress the list will grow and as the parser supports more exactly
the properties of the language tests will fail and need to be
re-written.

 

The typical JUnit patterns  I use: 

            try {

                        &#8230;

                        assertTrue(&#8220;should have thrown exception
XYZ&#8221;,false);

            } catch (SomeExpectedXYZException e) {

                        assertTrue(true);

            } 

 

 

            try {

                        &#8230;

            } catch (SomeUnExpectedException e) {

                        assertTrue(false);

            } 

 

Is there in the parser something that I could &#8216;hook&#8217; into to get the
status of the parsing process during/after a parse run was executed?

 

Again many thanks for your support and the good discussions on the list.

 

Raynier.

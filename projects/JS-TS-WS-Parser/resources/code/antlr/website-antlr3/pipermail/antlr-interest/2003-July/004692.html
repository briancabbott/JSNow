<PRE>There is already an SQL grammar to download from the antlr.org site.
Personally I wouldn't want to maintain a .y file that has been tweaked to
generate java.  Not to mention that I wouldn't want to debug it.  ANTLR's
strength is in its sane, human readable generated code.

I haven't heard of JB so I have no opinion of it.  Do you still need C
output as well?  From antlr you could generate Java or C++.

Subject: [antlr-interest] ANTLR -vs- JB


Hello,

I've been tasked with writing a parser for a SQL like
query language.  Another team of developers in my
company has already written a c-language parser based
on the grammar using Flex/Bison.  I've obtained their
input files (.y and .l) and obviously it makes sense
for me to take advantage of them rather than trying to
independently construct the grammar.   My parser,
however, is to be implemented in Java.  

One of my co-workers found something called 'jb'
(<A HREF="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/serl/misc/jb.html">http://www.cs.colorado.edu/serl/misc/jb.html</A>) which
purports to convert the output of bison into a java
parser.  This seems like the ideal solution: all I
need to do is replace the C in the .y file I obtained
with Java and I'm all set.  A few questions:

1) Does anyone on the list have any experience with
jb.  The documentation seems pretty sketchy and I'm
not even sure that it's any longer maintained. 
Neither of these fills me with conifidence?

2) If I were to use ANTLR, of what use would the .y
and .l files be?  Would I need to manually translate
the files to syntax ANTLR understands?  I'd really
like to use ANTLR because of how well it's documented,
how actively it's maintained, and how helpful the user community seems.

Thanks in advance for any thoughts anyone might have

-jason

</I>

I think the main problem is that when programmers realize they need to  
parse something, they often want to parse very ambiguous and ill- 
defined languages. Creating something that &quot;just works&quot; is hard for  
those types of languages, hence the fuck-up part.

However, if you turn on backtracking (and memoize) you generally will  
end up with a working solution, but the programmers (being  
professionals after all) don't like the incurred overhead. That's the  
point when people go &quot;uhhh, what an ugly tool, it's so slow and hard  
to learn&quot;. Only that the tool is not that hard to learn (there are  
really only a couple of rules (no pun) you need to follow) but the  
problem domain can be a tough one. Throw in keywords-as-identifiers,  
case insensitivity (in many cases only partly case-insensitive), and  
bona fide ambiguous constructs it is a pain to write parsers.

Often I wonder if people new to ANTLR even bother to check out the  
&quot;getting started&quot; page on the wiki. It's quite disturbing to me to  
think they do not, because when I'm new to a tool I might start  
playing with it as well without reading anything about it, but once I  
don't understand something, I turn to articles or blogs. Looking at <A HREF="http://antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/FAQ+-+Getting+Started">http://antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/FAQ+-+Getting+Started</A> 
  and following one or two links to the excellent intro by Mark  
Volkmann (for example) you should be up and running within a day or  
two, provided you accept the fact that you have to learn new stuff.  
(The &quot;you&quot; is of course not meant to be &quot;you&quot;, Raphael :))

Having said that, yeah sure there's room for improvement as with every  
tool out there.

I just realize that probably the biggest source of confusion are  
combined grammars. If a beginner does not grasp the important  
distinction between lexer and parser rules, it's probably best to  
start out with separate grammars for those. Then, all of a sudden,  
realization comes when you see that separation into two files. :)

cheers,
-k

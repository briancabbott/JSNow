<PRE>Actually, there are still issues here. Namely GLexer is trying to use
both A and B directly as delegates, but never initializes the A
delegate for G_B_A. G_B does, which leads me to believe that this can
be solved in the constructor by adding &quot;gA = gB.gA&quot; in the Java case,
&quot;self.gA = self.gB.gA&quot; for Python, &quot;ctx-&gt;gA = ctx-&gt;gB-&gt;gA&quot; for C, etc.
But then again G_B is delegating to G_B_A; why then does GLexer want
to delegate directly to G_B_A?

(Attached GLexer.java and the full grammar in G.zip.)

&gt;<i> I've gotten some very strange errors while trying to make a composite

</I>&gt;<i> posting this because the error messages were not that helpful on their
</I>&gt;<i> own, and I had to fool around for a while with a minimal test case
</I>&gt;<i> until I found a way out of the errors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a composite grammar G, which imports two disjoint lexer
</I>&gt;<i> grammars A and B, and a parser grammar C (which only requires the
</I>&gt;<i> tokens from A). Using antlr3.4 on G with varying subsequent changes
</I>&gt;<i> gives one of the following sets of errors, regardless of output option
</I>&gt;<i> or language.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. G has no rules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. parser rule ... not allowed in lexer, lexer rule ... not allowed in
</I>&gt;<i> parser, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. java.lang.ClassCastException: org.antlr.runtime.tree.CommonTree
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be cast to org.antlr.tool.GrammarAST.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The short answer (before I go into details below) is that a) G needs a
</I>&gt;<i> parser rule, not just lexer rules, and b) G should only import one
</I>&gt;<i> lexer grammar, and the others should be imported by that one.
</I>&gt;<i> Strangely, b) does not apply to parser grammars, as I added a second
</I>&gt;<i> parser grammar D (dependent on both A and B) to test, and G is fine*
</I>&gt;<i> either way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The long story: When I encountered (1), I added a dummy lexer rule
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;COMMA : ',' ;&quot;. This cured G's lack of rules but now antlr3.4 was
</I>&gt;<i> giving me (2), where it seemed that antlr3 thought I was putting all
</I>&gt;<i> of A's lexer rules in C and all of C's parser rules in A (and B,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.). Since I had no rules dependent on B, I removed it from being
</I>&gt;<i> imported. With G importing only A and C, I was now getting (3). I
</I>&gt;<i> added the rule &quot;comma : COMMA ;&quot; to G and now antlr3 completed
</I>&gt;<i> successfully (and still did when I folded these two rules together
</I>&gt;<i> into &quot;comma : ',' ;&quot;). So I added B back to the import list from G,
</I>&gt;<i> and it gave me (2) again. But removing B from G's import list and
</I>&gt;<i> making A import it made it work fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So antlr3 successfully produces a recognizer for G when G imports A,
</I>&gt;<i> C, and D, where A imports B, or when G imports B, C, and D, and B
</I>&gt;<i> imports A**.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure of the root reason behind the inability of the top level
</I>&gt;<i> of a composite grammar to import two lexer grammars (whether a design
</I>&gt;<i> decision or bug, eg.) as none of the documentation I could find on
</I>&gt;<i> composite grammars indicates either that this is the case or should be
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise. I would have liked a better error message in place of (2),
</I>&gt;<i> at least for the case where G had a lexer rule but not a parser rule,
</I>&gt;<i> because it would have saved a little bit of stumbling around.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *By &quot;fine&quot; I mean antlr3 finishes successfully. But if G doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> import B, then the generated lexer can't produce tokens defined in B
</I>&gt;<i> and so the rules in D can't be reached.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> **Unless you're like me, and have an unfortunately large lexer grammar
</I>&gt;<i> B, which causes antlr3 to run out of stack space if G imports A
</I>&gt;<i> imports B but not if G imports B imports A.

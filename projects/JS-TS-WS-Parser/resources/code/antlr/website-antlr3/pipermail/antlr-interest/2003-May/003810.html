<PRE>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>
Hi Ric,

&gt;<i> &gt; Not sure about how it can be done with C++ in the general case, 
</I>Ric?.
&gt;<i> &gt; Monty?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You could hack something together that does this I guess. Dynamic 
</I>loading
&gt;<i> works pretty ok on unix, yet you need a working compiler set, some 
</I>way to
&gt;<i> specify the right libraries and stuff for the loaded parts.
</I>
Dynamic loading (DLL) is at the core of Windows too.

&gt;<i> Best would probably be to rewrite a bit and convert the switch 
</I>statements
&gt;<i> and contents to tables with char ranges and function pointers to the
</I>&gt;<i> actions (bit of a simplified description this). These then could be 
</I>loaded
&gt;<i> on runtime. Parser would then degenerate to a driver for these 
</I>tables.

My first thought was defining COM-like binary interfaces for the 
Lexer/Parser/TreeParser that generated components will be required to 
implement. All interaction is then through those binary interfaces. 
Of course this is much easier for Windows - since COM is present - 
than other platforms (although Mozilla's XPCOM fills the gap nicely).
 
In the end, it similar to the C#/Java solution actually but the devil 
is in the details as you mentioned.

&gt;<i> I guess it's doable but not with the time I have to spent on antlr 
</I>atm (and
&gt;<i> then I'm not even mentioning d*mn MSVC)
</I>
With MS's recent-ish &quot;acquisitions&quot; of quite a few good C++ guys like 
Herb Sutter and Stan Lippman, it can only get better right?

Cheers!,

Micheal

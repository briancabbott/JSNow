hiya. :)  Well, imagine that you are modifying &quot;global&quot; state as you match characters in identifier; this is something done in actions that ANTLR can analyze. There is no way to &quot;roll this back&quot;.  ANTLR can only provide the information you specified about where it is and what character it was parsing--it can't deal with other member variables that you have updated.  Plus tracking all that information for input character could get expensive even if it was limited to that.

I'm leaning towards a trivial NFA implementation (Thompson's algorithm from the 60s as described by Russ Cox)

<A HREF="http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp2.html">http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp2.html</A>

because it allows us to save partial matches like id=ID very easily, unlike a DFA. Unfortunately, we really need identifiers and keywords to be efficient because that's what most input streams consist of. I'm not sure I could get the NFA to go that fast compared to a DFA. On the other hand, the new NFA-based mechanism would likely be faster than the current v3 mechanism which is guaranteed to recognize the first few characters of any token twice. so, in the end I should go for the smallest implementation and the simplest that gives us the capabilities. That would spell Thompson's NFA-based algorithm. There's even a chance that I could make it go faster using two or three threads instead of just one to do the NFA simulation.

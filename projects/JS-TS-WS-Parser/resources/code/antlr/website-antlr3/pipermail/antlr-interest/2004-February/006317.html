Indeed it will... The problem I was referring too, however, is that it is not 
always so obvious whether a rule is going to be recursive or not (because 
there might be many alternative sub-rules, and in a large grammar, it's 
probably tedious to check which of them eventually calls the original rule 
again). And as I see it, it is necessary to find all points of recursion, 
because each of those has a potential of overwriting the top of stack...

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> identifier will set the attribute value and you are free to use it at
</I>&gt;<i> the appropriate time.  In your myRule example, you need to make a copy
</I>&gt;<i> of the index value before it calls identifier again.  This is
</I>&gt;<i> simulating what a return value bubbling up would do.  It's set below,
</I>&gt;<i> but each reference has a copy.  The instance variable approach avoids
</I>&gt;<i> the problem of having to define the return value in all the
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate rules and the stack avoids the &quot;what about recursive rule
</I>&gt;<i> ref&quot; problem.
</I>
That will work as well, with the same problem as above: you need to be sure 
which sub-rules will eventually call &quot;identifier&quot;, and make a copy for each 
of them. But it may be needed to make copies in sub-rules too, if they 
themselves call &quot;identifier&quot; multiple times, and so on...

So in conclusion, I guess it will work, but analyzing where pushes and pops 
and copies need to be made, is going to be almost as bad as having to pass a 
parameter...

Unless of course I'm overlooking something again, but I think I could make an 
example illustrating this if needed...

Thanks,

Hans

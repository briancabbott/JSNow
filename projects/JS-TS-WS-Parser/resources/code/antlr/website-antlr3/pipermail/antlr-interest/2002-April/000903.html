</I>
Regarding Boehm GC: From what I've read - yes, it should handle any
circular structures fine. I think a bigger question about Boehm GC is: is
it as portable as Antlr/C++ currently is?

I think that for Antlr's purposes, a memory pool makes more sense than a
full blown GC anyway. (Er, as long as it is implemented allowing Antlr
users to easily create multiple memory pools - one for each tree required
in memory.) With GC, there's the overhead of scanning the memory to find
unreachable objects. With a memory pool - well - when you're done, you're
done, right?

It's been a while since I read about customizing new/delete in C++. I hope
you're not talking about a global replacement for new/delete, but just
building custom new/delete specifically for the objects which should be
stored in memory pools...? I think I read somewhere that globally replacing
new/delete is &quot;evil&quot;.

Is there an online link to that book's memory pool implementation, or do I
have to make a trip to the bookstore? :-)

&gt;<i> At least RefAST would dissappear it's causing most 'problems' (or kludges)
</I>&gt;<i> and indeed it would become a plain old pointer. RefToken is less
</I>&gt;<i> troublesome (no heterogenous tokens and stuff like that).
</I>
If the overhead of a garbage collector is added anyway... it might not make
sense to have the overhead of ref counting for anything. I'd like to deal
with RefToken as well, at least eventually, because of the problems with
hiddenTokens.

&gt;<i> Can't you use your own flavour of hidden tokens? I just had a small look
</I>&gt;<i> at the current implementation and I think it can be changed a little to
</I>&gt;<i> solve the reference counting problem. (basically play dirty in a few
</I>&gt;<i> places and store pointers to the objects in stead of using the RefToken) 
</I>
Wouldn't be too tough, I don't think. I'd have to hack or replace
CommonHiddenStreamToken, as well as CommonHiddenTokenFilter, which refers
to CommonHiddenStreamToken. Storing dumb pointers instead of storing
RefTokens is asking for trouble down the road though, I think. For one, you
would quickly find that you need to pass RefToken to various functions, and
a dumb pointer does you no good.

&gt;<i> Or do it less dirty and use a single linked list of visible tokens and in
</I>&gt;<i> the visible tokens you store a vector (or single linked list) with all
</I>&gt;<i> hidden tokens before/after the visible one. I don't see why a double
</I>&gt;<i> linked list is necessary there (probably there because of direct port
</I>&gt;<i> from java).
</I>
I thought about using a vector of backlinks instead of a double-linked AST
structure. However, in designing it, I found that there was a fair bit less
data overhead involved in just putting the backlinks directly into the AST.

&gt;<i> Another possibility is adding a custom new/delete to the hidden token
</I>&gt;<i> implementation. Allocate them from a pool attach the pool to the
</I>&gt;<i> lexer/parser and delete the pool with the lexer/parser object.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you switch to another scheme of reference counting (you btw got a
</I>&gt;<i> reference on that style of ref counting?) you may have to do some antlr
</I>&gt;<i> surgery.
</I>
A link to that style of ref counting:
<A HREF="http://agora.cubik.org/wiki/view/Main/ReferenceCounting">http://agora.cubik.org/wiki/view/Main/ReferenceCounting</A>
...follow the link to &quot;acyclic refcounting&quot;. Unfortunately, it's more a
description of the motivation than it is a description of the
implementation.

To get me up and running quickly, I've identified where my problems are and
have come up with a solution which should work for me, at least for the
short term. It's certainly not as ideal as getting rid of the refcounting,
but it'll do for now.

There were two problems:
1. With my double linked AST, cyclic dependencies would prevent a dropped
branch from deleting itself. (It would get missed in my &quot;back unlink&quot;
cleanup function.)
2. With the current implementation of the hidden tokens, there was a
problem with figuring out when to delete them. Given nodes N1 and N2,
hidden tokens H1 and H2:
  N1 -&gt; H1 &lt;=&gt; H2 &lt;- N2
If N1 is dropped, how do I know if H1 and H2 are to be dropped as well? It
depends on whether N2 still exists or not, but there's no link from H2 to
N2, so there's no easy way to find out.

My workaround: Don't drop/dereference (what do you call it?!) any nodes. If
a node is to be removed from the tree, move it to -another- tree, which
I've called &quot;looseEnds&quot;. Then, at cleanup time, clean up the main tree as
well as the looseEnds tree. (Obviously I've already written functions for
cleaning up back links in the AST and for cleaning up the hidden tokens
when AST is deleted.)

Regards,
John

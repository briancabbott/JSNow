</I>
Breakage (of compiling/linking, rather than logic) could be avoided by 
leaving in deprecated register* methods that delegate to the Interpreter.

&gt;<i> On the other hand I personally would prefer to stick to the &quot;per group&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> registration of renderers/adapters and add the &quot;look first in native
</I>&gt;<i> group&quot; feature. This would mean there could be more than one renderer
</I>&gt;<i> per class (e.g. for String). However I don't have a problem with this as
</I>&gt;<i> long it is clear what renderer is used. The main reason why I support
</I>&gt;<i> this is probably the way I look at groups. Rather than looking at
</I>&gt;<i> imported groups as &quot;helpers&quot; groups are for me the units of

</I>&gt;<i> this makes the reuse harder and more error-prone. (BTW: this change is
</I>&gt;<i> compatible with existing code, just adds some more options)
</I>
Given my plan (discussed in another email not yet replied to by anyone, 
which is a separate point), I am convinced of the general point. We 
shouldn't think purely in terms of OO inheritence, but also in terms of 
modularity.

&gt;<i> So I see two options regarding renderers/adapters of imported groups here:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) move the renderer/adapter stuff from STGroup to Interpreter, or
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Implement the &quot;look first in native group&quot; for renderers/adapters (my
</I>&gt;<i> favorite)
</I>
As I mentioned in another mail, I think it's worth doing both.

&gt;&gt;<i> Udo: can you live with making one uber-string-renderer?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually no, as this does not really solves the problem I tried to point
</I>&gt;<i> out. The example I brought up was just an example to illustrate the
</I>&gt;<i> situation. Of cause one could come up with solutions that work around
</I>&gt;<i> the issue, but this was not really my point.
</I>
Well, I see the better handling of String cases as fixing a specific 
issue, not a work-around; it would be a better way of handling those 
cases (templates and standard filtering being more clear and 
architecturally consistent than a special renderer, and also handling 
the case where a single group wants to do more than one of these style 
of outputs). I think it's worth having even with the other changes suggested

&gt;<i> My main point was asking to support renderers in imported groups
</I>&gt;<i> (without changing the root groups). This is not directly related to
</I>&gt;<i> String renderers. E.g. if I have a general purpose group &quot;XMLUtil&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> dealing with XML I want to add a renderer(/adapter) for
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;org.w3c.dom.Node&quot; to the &quot;XMLUtil&quot; group. The &quot;root groups&quot; don't need
</I>&gt;<i> to know about this. I may even have different groups using different
</I>&gt;<i> adapters/renderers of &quot;Node&quot;. This leads to a better system structure,
</I>&gt;<i> with all these things like &quot;information hiding&quot;, &quot;separation of
</I>&gt;<i> concern&quot;, &quot;modularization&quot;, &quot;encapsulation&quot;, &#8230;
</I>
This has got me thinking of a UML class diagram adaptation for 
STGroups... because they aren't like classes, but they have got concerns 
of encapsulation, separation of concerns, and so forth. It's worth 
thinking about the options in terms of how they satisfy those 
properties. Your example case does show why it's worth having per-group 
adapters (less convinced about renderers, but there's no reason not to 
do the same for both that I can see yet) where the defining group takes 
precedence. How does the apply to cases like the usual examples, though, 
where group inclusion is used for extension rather than modularisation? 
If we pitch the whole structure towards modularisation rather than 
inheritence, we need to make it clear in examples. Can we do both? Is it 
worth having a mechanism for telling a group to inherit renderers and 
adapters from a particular included group - we don't want it by default, 
but we may want to sometimes. It might already be possible, I think, but 
do we want it to be done easily and clearly where it's wanted? I would 
say so. Then do we want it done at inclusion time? This makes more sense 
in code than in group files, but in the file case is there anything to 
'inherit'? Surely the inheritence question only applies when you're 
including the other group in code, rather than in a group file. So it 
can be done as part of the inclusion call, or as a separate call 
('inheritRenderersFrom()', 'inheritAdaptersFrom()'). Then, if it's done, 
does it want to be a static copy at call time, or a delegation when the 
renderer or adapter is actually needed? I'd tend to say the latter, but 
that makes for more complex code.

Simple answers are rare, I guess.

Perhaps semantically, myST.appendAttribute(myAtt) might be most
'accurate' (for some definition of accurate).

When I describe ST to others, it goes:

1) create ST
2) add attributes
3) call toString

Because, like, you know, &quot;you have to add your attributes to the template
engine, _before_ calling toString&quot;.

Add is the word I use in general conversation, ie &quot;lay usage&quot;.

Add is easy to remember.

There is precedent for add in java libs (can be said of put and others
too though).

Everything else (except perhaps addAttribute) is not as simple.

If there were two entirely different classes of things being added to
ST, then perhaps I might encourage addAttribute, to distinguish from
addOtherImportantThingWhichIsDefinitelyNotAnAttribute, and
notwithstanding, I would still advocate for .add(..) to be an alias of
addAttribute (common case, short, etc).

Hopefully my vote is clear :)

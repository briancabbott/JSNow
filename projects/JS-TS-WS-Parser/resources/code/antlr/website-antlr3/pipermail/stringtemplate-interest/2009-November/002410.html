sure. why not.

it's easy. just have a list of supergroups. walk in order looking for  
the template.

</I>
Well, i'm not implementing interfaces this time. not really needed.   
Java has a much more complicated problem than templates.  I never felt  
the need in ST to have packages. subtrees of templates on disk kind of  
does that.

&gt;&gt;<i> That means that we are creating a new group derived from GeneralView.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GeneralView. This lets us inherit and refine templates from above.   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the comment suggests, we need the group file loader so that ST knows
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how to locate GeneralView as it parses that file. I no longer have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that header inside group files so I don't think we need the group
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> loader anymore; we will construct the hierarchy manually:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds ... manual.
</I>
Yep, and sometimes you need it for dynamically choosing supergroup.

&gt;<i> How about something like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   StringTemplateEngine e = STFactory.getPlatformInstance();
</I>&gt;<i>   e.addTemplatePath(&quot;~/st/mylibs&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i>   e.addTemplatePath(&quot;C:\st\mylibs&quot;); // Windows version
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Not sure we need paths since when coding you know which one to load  
since you're saying explicitly which to load.  Perhaps we can add a  
path thing later.

&gt;<i> This to me looks clean.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, no reason to not have &quot;programmatical assembly of templates
</I>&gt;<i> and groups&quot; api, as we have now. But I imagine, for any system of
</I>&gt;<i> significant size, the process I suggest above will be a godsend.
</I>&gt;<i> I've been craving for such simplicity for a while, and was
</I>&gt;<i> contemplating for some time (for when I had time) to create a separate
</I>&gt;<i> module which would do a little custom parsing and assembling, to
</I>&gt;<i> effectively get this auto-import/multi-inheritance type thing off the
</I>&gt;<i> ground for my own system. But a generic solution is always preferable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Q:
</I>&gt;<i> Does the above suggestion look clean, workable, and implementable?
</I>
how is it different than group loaders?

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This will decrease complexity significantly (by removing the entire
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concept of group loader).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nice. But we should not need to put complexity back onto the ST user.
</I>&gt;<i> Let's follow Java's lead, and make ST more structured - increase
</I>&gt;<i> performance of ST, and provide greater flexibility and complexity
</I>&gt;<i> management to the user, at a small cost of syntax overhead (to the
</I>&gt;<i> user - implementation aside).
</I>
I've never needed the loader when manually setting supergroup.

&gt;<i> It's really nice to be able to work within ST 'text' files,
</I>&gt;<i> without having to re-compile some host (java, c# etc) code
</I>&gt;<i> to get my latest changes.
</I>
yep :)

&gt;&gt;<i> My only concern is that now we have two trees:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * trees of templates. For websites we often have many directories of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> templates grouped into subtrees on the disk
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * inheritance hierarchy (tree)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should deprecate the old concept of templates in individual
</I>&gt;<i> files grouped into directories.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Allow the user to choose one or the other 'loader' :)
</I>&gt;<i> to provide a version or two worth of backward compatibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know it's the way you used to do it, but for editing templates
</I>&gt;<i> without some custom ST-aware editor, group files grouped in directory
</I>&gt;<i> 'packages' is definitely the preferred way to use directories as a
</I>&gt;<i> complexity management tool.  Simply makes large systems development
</I>&gt;<i> sane, at least in my world.
</I>
STv4 treats .stg files as directories of .st files. they are same now.

&gt;<i> The only things missing in ST are multiple imports, and a ClassPath/
</I>&gt;<i> TemplatePath or TEMPLATE_PATH. So we can consider MI as multiple
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;imports&quot;, which is really what I am after here: I want to be able
</I>&gt;<i> to do something very similar to Java's package &quot;import&quot; statements,
</I>&gt;<i> where I can 'import' needed ST functionality (groups, or even
</I>&gt;<i> individual templates).
</I>
you'll have mult. inher.

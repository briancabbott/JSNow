Subject: [stringtemplate-interest] Retrieving declared parameters of a
	string template
Message-ID: <50192F99.8010900@luciad.com>

Hi,

Is it possible to somehow retrieve all parameters that were declared in 
a template, regardless of whether they were actually needed to render 
the template?

e.g.

University $university$
$first(departments):{department | $department.name$}$
$if(semester1)$
     some text
$elseif(semester2)$
     some text
$else$
     some text
$endif$

would result in 'university', 'departments', 'semester1', 'semester2' 
(not 'department', as it is used to loop over 'departments').

Solutions for both stringtemplate v3 and v4 are fine.

Regards,

Bart Verhoeven

Hiya, adding more RAM to prevent out of memory errors with tomcat. antlr.org will be back up hopefully within the hour.

Hi Bart, in v4, the attributes referenced within a template must be formally defined like function argument but they can also reference inherited attributes. I think the right approach would be to look at the byte codes and pull out any load_attr or load_local  instructions. You'll find all of the byte code instructions in Bytecode.java and can follow the code template in BytecodeDisassembler.java to easily walk to byte codes to pull out the list of attribute references. oh,  wait. You want not this static list, but the ones that were actually referenced, eh?

To do that, the easiest thing to do is probably alter or override getAttribute() in the Interpreter. That is called by the by code instructions.

Hi.Sorry about that. It's basically the exact same thing as a regular group except that it does not require the template definition around the text. Instead of doing the following inside foo.st:

foo(a,b) ::= <<
this is a sample template that references $a$ and $b$.
>>

 you would do this:

this is a sample template that references $a$ and $b$.

It implicitly allows any attribute reference unlike when you formally define the attributes as parameters.

I just added a note to the introduction:

Subject: [stringtemplate-interest] Passing argument to a sub-template in a
	STRawGroupDir
Message-ID: <502A6F3A.9050203@nuecho.com>

Hi,

I've started upgrading our version of StringTemplate from v3 to v4 and 
to ease the process I've been using the STRawGroupDir to avoid having to 
modify our templates. I've fixed most of our issues (including the issue 
#5 from github :D) but now I'm stuck on another problem that I'm unsure 
if I'm doing it right or wrong. I haven't been able to find more 
information online about this feature...

I have the following template snippets:
alarm_content.st:
... snip ...
  Alert
   <em>$alarm_content.triggerCauseName$</em>
   <strong>$alarm_content.triggerStatus$</strong>

rss.st:
... snip ...
$context.items:{item|
     $alarm_content(alarm_content=item.content)$

That gives me the following errors:
context [/rss /_sub1] 26:15 passed 1 arg(s) to template /alarm_content 
with 0 declared arg(s)
context [/rss /_sub1] 26:15 attribute alarm_content isn't defined
context [/rss /_sub1 /alarm_content] 3:7 attribute alarm_content isn't 
defined
... and some more, one for every item ...

I've tried various approach to the sub-template calling, but to no 
avail. I've tried the $item.content:alarm_content()$ syntax that gave 
the same errors. Am I doing something wrong or this is unsupported when 
using RawGroup?

On another note, I'd like to know the advantages of using the formal 
template declaration (templateName(args) ::= ) instead of the plain 
template file like I'm doing right now. I have some quite big templates 
that have a lot of injected values from the java side (ST#add(String, 
Object)) and it seems like I have to declare all of them as argument of 
a template, which is a no-go. I could always include all of them in a 
single "context" attribute, but this seems a bit hackery for something 
that worked well in v3. Also, it seems that using formal declaration I 
need to escape the double-quote inside the template, which is annoying 
for html templates, and it complains about "\n in string". This is a lot 
of work for using something that I don't know the advantages, other then 
formalism.

Thank you for your time.

Message-ID: <6D905FC9-036B-4162-B553-A0F7CA2542B4@cs.usfca.edu>

Hi, a minor update to ST, but it includes a very useful STRawGroupDir that makes it much easier to work with pure templates (without header definitions) such as HTML-based templates. See more here:

http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ST4/4.0.5+Release+Notes

http://www.stringtemplate.org/download.html

Also note that we are now officially fully on github.

Hiya, I've removed antlr/stringtemplate and we should is antlr/stringtemplate3 instead now. Also I have created antlr/antlr3, which is what everybody should use. I have notified all users that have forked the old antlr/antlr repository, at least those that had e-mail addresses in github. This old repository is now stale and will be deleted soon.

antlr3
antlr4
stringtemplate3
stringtemplate4

or the correct repositories.

For those not so familiar with git, here is a quick way to update your
remote urls for "origin":

To view current remote(s):
git remote -v

To change url of remote named "origin" for antl.git to antlr3.git:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/antlr/antlr3.git

And similar for stringtemplate.

Now, I only had an st4 github repo, so I just added the st3 repo to my
existing st4 git clone, under a different remote name ("st3" funnily
enough), as follows:
git remote add st3 https://github.com/antlr/stringtemplate3.git
git fetch st3
git branch st3 st3/master
git branch -a

Then of course you can swap between st3 and origin i.e. st4 if it's
called origin, or you could rename origin to st4 or add a branch named
st4 as you wish.

Note that if you do as I did (combining st3 and st4), you will get a
warning saying that no shared root/parent commit was found. This is
expected. It is of course not at all necessary to have combined repo,
just a preference of mine...

Regards
Zen

Subject: [stringtemplate-interest] Question on index with an offset in a
	sub-template
Message-ID: <CAGWbJj8w1wAdc55vZaFMwzAwrDun+Dq5QBQXReX_PVLe7270kQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a question and/or a suggestion.

I want to use an index with a specified offset in a subtemplate. I
understand that currently you can use an index starting from 0 or 1
like following:

<attrs:{a| <a> is <i0>th item}; separator=", ">.

which will give the following result if attrs is ["apple", "orange"]

apple is 0th item, orange is 1th item.

However, I have an offset for the index and want to use it something
like following:

<attrs:{a| <a> is <i.(offset)>th item}; separator=", ">.

Where offset is an (integer) attribute.

Is it possible to do this? If not, do you guys think it's a good idea
to add this to StringTemplate?

Thanks,

-Jiwon

Hi Jiwon, I think here, to be general, you need to pass in a map or 2 lists: {"apple":9, "orange":30}

then 

<attrs:{a| <a> is <attrs.(a)>th item}; separator=", ">.

if attrs is hash. this is for v4. in v3, iteration was on values not keys.

Subject: [stringtemplate-interest] [Java] unrendering a template back to an
	object
Message-ID: <CAE6YeMzMybFjjVpit4Br+yNyhV8G8sf_RbecJEjOEmkRJVvVQQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Interest List,

Apologies if this is a newbie question but how do I take a string that
I know is derived from a particular template and render it back to an
object of the type that originally populated it?  If this solution (or
known availability of one) is posted somewhere , I'd greatly
appreciate an address.

Details below.

Kind regards,

VR

[1] ?I have a class named Person:
public class Person {
 String firstName;
 String lastName;
 public void getFirstName(){
   return firstName;
 }
 public String getFirstName() {
   return firstName;
 }
}

[2]  I have a template person.stg:
html(p):==<<
<html>
  <body>
     <dl>
            <dt>first name <dd>^p.firstName$</dd></dt>
            <dt>last name <dd>^p.lastName$</dd></dt>
     </dl>
  </body>
</html>
>>

[3]  I then render the template:
		Person person = new Person();
		person.setFirstName("Vivek");
		person.setLastName("Ramaswamy");
		STGroup g = new STGroupFile("templates/person/person.stg","^","$");
		ST st = g.getInstanceOf("html");
                st.add("p",person);
                String renderedTemplate = st.render();

[4]  My question, does StringTemplate give me the ability to take the
String output, 'renderedTemplate', and unrender it back into a Person
object?  In effect unmarshall it.  It seems like this might be
possible if I provide the original template and a class definition.
I'm guessing this is _not_ possible but I thought I'd check before
building something that does this for my specific situation.

Hi,Unfortunately, ST is simply generating random text as far as it is concerned. It has no idea in what language is generating output nor which phrase within a particular language. This is almost certainly an undecidable problem.

Subject: [stringtemplate-interest] Cannot get $elseif(condition)$ to work
Message-ID: <CAAjFwkYzqDJkLcdJ37r5s5iPrsqG2x19vyXgZQk_6nUhv_HXQg@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I am currently working on a DSPF to Java transformation. When constructing
my *.stg template file I am struggling to find out why my template code is
not working and I am not finding relevent answers in Google or the ST
website. The error I get is as follows:

"java.lang.
IllegalArgumentException: Can't find template elseif.st; context is
[dspfScreenMain anonymous if(it.subfile)_subtemplate]"

I am iterating through a List of objects and each of these objects can be
of type SUBFILE, SUBFILE_CONTROL or STANDARD. So to sort these out I need
to do an elseif and I cannot get the $elseif$ working.

My code is as follows:

$dspfScreen.screenRecords:{
$if(it.subfile)$
FOUND SUBFILE - output sub file inner class
$elseif(it.subfileCtrl)$
FOUND SUBFILE CONTROL - output subfile control inner class
$else$
FOUND STANDARD - output standard record inner class
$endif$

With this code I get the error as explained above. If I remove the
$elseif(x)$ I have no problem but I really need to test for multiple things
and this won't be the only time I need to do it. So I was wondering why I
get the error and why is my code wrong?

I know there are many ways to skin this cat, I could sort these objects in
my Java class and iterate through each of the sorted Lists but being able
to use the $esleif$ would be handy.

Cheers for any help and advice you can give :)

Thanks

Big Jim

HI,

I am working on a RFI related to content adaptation and as part of that evaluating different templating engines. I am looking for a comparison matrix comparison String Template with other similar solutions. Kindly share the same if one available. Also any information on different parameters against which a templating engine should be evaluated will be helpful as well.

Since working on aggressive timelines, will appreciate an early response.

Thanks

Since you signed up for the mailing list, I suppose you also checked
out the website at http://www.stringtemplate.org/ ?

Check out the articles, especially
http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~parrt/papers/mvc.templates.pdf

As for comparisons, I think Google is probably your friend here.
https://www.google.com/search?q=compare+stringtemplate

It brings up
* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3741618/what-are-the-main-differences-between-stringtemplate-and-freemarker

I can't find any examples of side by side comparisons with competitors though.
But I didn't look that hard.

Message-ID: <CANWjzH3ireSNnuUGnEoMLTgYen-1+qrN+Ma4220X34f_=L9c2w@mail.gmail.com>

I'm new to StringTemplate and baffled about how to iterate over a list
using ST4 in a servlet.

Given a List<String> called "items":

List<String> items = Arrays.asList("hello", "world");
view.set("items", items);

I've seen examples claiming this works:

<ul>
  $items:{<li>$it$</li>}$
</ul>

But I get this error:

> anonymous template has 0 arg(s) but mapped across 1 value(s)

which was discussed here:

http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/stringtemplate-interest/2011-February/003064.html

Trying the different form suggested above (which I could be
misinterpreting):

$items:{value|$value$}$

gives this error:

> no such template: /layouts/_sub20

I'm setting up the template via the servlet with:

STRawGroupDir dir = new STRawGroupDir("/com/foo/views", '$', '$');
ST template = dir.getInstanceOf("layouts/application");

The "_sub{x}" part in the error increases every time I try to reload my
page. Any ideas of where this simple thing is going wrong?

Thanks,
Rich

To follow up with something easier to test/debug - here's a complete JUnit
test that shows the source of my confusion:

https://gist.github.com/1943633

The first test passes as I expect. The second test gives the error:

context [template] 1:1 no such template: /_sub1

context [template] 1:8 passed 1 arg(s) to template null with 0 declared
arg(s)

context [template] 1:1 passed 1 arg(s) to template null with 0 declared

context [template] 1:1 passed 1 arg(s) to template null with 0 declared
arg(s)

context [template] 1:1 passed 1 arg(s) to template null with 0 declared

Any ideas?

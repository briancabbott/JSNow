inheritance should work for you.

Leave the abstract group as a group not interface i think.

The lexer used for *.st files in my C# 3 port of ST 3.2 appears to be
"TemplateLexer".

Can you check if this works for you (typeof(TemplateLexer))?

Hi. That is pretty strange. I did not build the C# version and Kunle is no
longer working on the project so I'm not sure what to do.  any looked in
this source bucket:

Hi Andy,

 

There have been few, if any, changes to the StringTemplate 3.2 C# port since
I uploaded that build. It should be stable (that's certainly the goal), but
I haven't had too many testers trying it in different scenarios. If you
decide to use it, your feedback would be very valuable.

 

Thank you,

Sam Harwell

How stable is the source?  If I did a fresh pull and build would I be in a
good place or .. ?

Thanks -andy

PS:  excuse the possible double post, my mail reader did some weird things
for some reason.

Hi Andy,

 

I see I have an updated build at the following link, but I'm not 100% sure
it's the latest I've created. I'll have to check that later. I do know this
is a build I was actively using for some time.

I'm trying to locate the latest C# binaries but am unsure which ones to
grab.   I believe what I'm looking for are the binaries/source referenced in
these 2 forum messages:

http://www.mail-archive.com/antlr-dev at antlr.org/msg00663.html

http://www.mail-archive.com/antlr-dev at antlr.org/msg00666.html

In both cases the given links no longer exist.   

All the C# links given on the download page
(http://www.stringtemplate.org/download.html) seem to point to older and/or
orphaned versions.

Any info on where to get the current 'stable' downloads/source?

Thanks -andy

Hi

I am having the same issue as a previous subscriber with the version
of Antlr3.Runtime conflicting between ST 3.2 and NH 2.1.

Would it be possible to get a build of ST 3.2 against the same
Antlr3.Runtime DLL that NH 2.1 uses, or give me a way to get the two
to play together nicely?

Kind Regards

Mark

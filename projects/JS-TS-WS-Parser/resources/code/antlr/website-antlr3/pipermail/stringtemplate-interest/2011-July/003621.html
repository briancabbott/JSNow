And from what you say about load(String) I'd be able to avoid using some 
of that depending on how I get from my template info (however stored) to 
a compiledST. Not sure how I'd go about that, but more on that below.

&gt;&gt;<i> So, apart from being insane, does anyone have thoughts? Is what I'm

</I>&gt;<i> rawDefineTemplate()
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> because you override load(), it will never get to methods like
</I>&gt;<i> loadTemplateFile().
</I>
So with load() overridden, everything else (pretty much) will 'just 
work', with effectively automatic caching of a criteria-based lookup, I 
think (say I ask for template /a/b/c, the load method could find the 
best match at /a/*/c, and then the STGroup will remember that that's the 
match without doing the lookup again). If I ignore how I want precedence 
to work (a better match in an imported group having precedence over a 
worse match in the 'main' group), that seems to do it all just fine. 
There's a few ways of working around that (such as using my own 
repository of available templates, rather than ST importing, which is 
fine if I don't want to make use of whatever the behaviour of renderers 
and modeladaptors ends up being, which is a fine limitation I think)... 
so the questions then end up...

Say I have a repository of template definitions that are in-memory (for 
argument's sake) but otherwise identical to template files as used in 
group directories. I can have an internal lookup to find the right one. 
Couple of problems - first, and not necessarily very important, the 
names I'd expect them to have would still have some sort of wildcard in, 
and thus not match the string fed to the load() method (though obviously 
this could be fixed by substitution). Would this matter (I'm guessing yes)?

How would I get a CompiledST from this? Using compile() or one of the 
defineTemplate()s? With those, apart from the error-locating Tokens, it 
looks like I'd be better with my representation already having separated 
the name, arguments (and parsing them), and the template text. Have I 
missed a method (or roundabout way) of simplifying that? Actualy, 
loadTemplateFile looks like it might be very much suited to this, 
despite the 'file' in its name, though the question of name is still 
there from the last question. So... which of these would work most 
straightforwardly?

Finally, whatever the answers to the above, one possible problem I can 
forsee is this - say I have a base template with name 'pattern' /a/*/c, 
and it ends up being matched when the names /a/b/c, /a/d/c and /a/foo/c 
were used. I'd end up with effective duplication of the template, with 
three CompiledST instances with three different concrete names and 
otherwise identical. Is there any way to avoid this? For that matter, 
how much of a problem is it likely to be, if there are say a dozen 
templates that suffer from the duplication and these are each duplicated 
4 times (and there being another couple of dozen templates that aren't 
duplicated at all) - what order of magnitude of extra memory or 
processing burden is there likely to be? My instinct is it wouldn't be 
too bad.

&gt;&gt;<i> Is it sensible to reuse the directory-hierarchy symbol ('/')
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for my hierarchy, or would it be better to use some other symbol
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> arbitrarily? For the purposes of referring inside a template, what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> characters are valid for template names? Is there any reason (when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> adding a template to a group) to restrict the lookup name for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> template itself to the same characters? My glance at the grammars
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suggests that IDs have to be the tradition mix of letters and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> underscores, and that would (I assume) apply to references within a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> template to another template (except '/' is obviously allowed, binding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> several of those together), but if the name is being provided
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dynamically in code (rather than read from a file), would it be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> restricted similarly? If it's all as restricted as it could possibly be,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there's still ways around it, but I thought I'd check, as it'd be better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to have (for instance) the wildcard being some character, rather than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the absence of any character between separators.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Finally: no, really, is this insane?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Possibly, but I'm not sure. ;) I really don't understand the problem
</I>&gt;<i> you're trying to solve.
</I>
I'm trying to put together an engine for dynamic template-based 
construction of web app output. I think it will have broad application, 
but my base use-case I'm using to conceptualise it is actually like the 
templating scheme for Drupal (only less arcane and odd) - so the program 
will know, for instance, that it's outputting a row of output for a view 
known a 'viewA', and will ask for /viewrow/viewA (with a default 
template /viewrow/* there to satisfy the need if the template designer, 
taking care of website appearance, hasn't made a specific one in this 
case), and when wanting to output a field of type 'text' with name 'bob' 
it will ask for /viewfield/viewA/bob/text (which could be satisfied by 
the default /viewfield/*/*/*, or by a app-wide default for text fields 
/viewfield/*/*/text, or by a view-specific template for the field bob 
(that doesn't actually care about type) /viewfield/viewA/bob/*). 
Obviously, exactly how those name patterns are done is subject to 
change, depending on factors including what's possible, hence my 
worrying about what names look like and what characters they can contain 
when they are a reference in the body of another template.

The intention is that the app will load all templates (including ones 
related to add-on modules) at startup time, and at other times when 
specifically requested (flushing the cache and including templates from 
modules that have been loaded since startup), but they don't have to be 
compiled by ST until their first use (or they could be pre-compiled at 
start up as well, either way works).

My plan is to use this in a number of java web programming projects. 
Well, and release it if it doesn't look to messy to let other people 
see. Thus the intention is to have a design that's actually flexible 
enough to do any reasonable task in it's field. What it will do for all 
such applications is firstly to allow the template selection to not 
depend only on what components are used, but also on the instance of 
use; it will also allow easy and flexible re-skinning of the whole lot. 
Basically, this will lead to a presentation layer based on 
StringTemplate rather than JSP or Facelets, albeit with some 
infrastructure having to be done directly in Java to define how the 
top-level templates are selected and populated. No substantive logic in 
the presentation layer, though :)

So, insane? More than necessary but interesting? Completely cuccoo?

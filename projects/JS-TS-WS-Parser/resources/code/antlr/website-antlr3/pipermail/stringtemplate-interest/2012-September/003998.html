<PRE>Howdy folks,

ANTLR v4 release is rapidly approaching. The beta of the reference book will be out next week and the remaining two or three chapters should appear within a month or so afterwards. Sam Harwell and I have been working very hard on the tool itself and we should have 4.0 ready by the time the book goes final. In the meantime, 4.0b1 will be available for use with the beta book. Oh, and we need to release 3.4.1 before 4.0.

I have paid for a new website design for both ANTLR and StringTemplate, which looks great. We will continue to use the same wiki software for documentation. The current website is generated by a Java server I built whereas the new one is going to be static so I have less software to maintain. In other words,  rather than using some kind of include mechanism to get the general look and feel on each page, the new websites will be simply static files on the disk.  The current antlr.org content will become antlr3.org, leaving the current domain pointing at v4 content.

We currently have functionality on the websites to accept new grammars and filesharing and articles and so on. Because this is so infrequent, I think it's reasonable to simply have an HTML form that has an email action instead of an HTTP POST. When I get those requests, I can simply add them to the file on the server. (will that use the user's local mail client or will it force people to set up mail in their actual browsers before it will email me? does anybody know?)

On to the grammar repository. Because it's likely we'll want to make fixes / updates to existing grammars, I don't think a simple form / email mechanism is the best solution. Right now, I have to go in and overwrite / update a number of files for a grammar update. Naturally, this screams for a revision control solution. I was thinking that we might as well just use github for this so that anybody can add or modify the publicly available grammars.

There are a number of issues with using github for this. First, I would not want to create a new repository for each grammar so we would have one repository holding all grammars. This is pretty coarse granularity.  On the other hand, if you just want one grammar, you can download individually from github. The second issue is that we would really have to have a single license for all grammars in the repository. I would hate for a GPL grammar to get its stank on the other grammars. It would confuse people to have multiple licenses within a single repository. Thirdly, not everyone is comfortable with assembly language&#8230;er&#8230;I mean git. In that case, people could simply mail me a grammar for inclusion. It would only take me a second to add it. The fourth problem. We need a clean URI for grammars and I propose: 

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/grammars/&lt;name">http://www.antlr.org/grammars/&lt;name</A>&gt;

for the root directory of that project. For example,

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/grammars/java">http://www.antlr.org/grammars/java</A>

would point out a directory that contains Java.g4 and may be a test program or something.

I could easily add a redirect in the tomcat configuration files, assuming I can stomach all of that filthy XML, but that does not scale very well when people add grammars. Instead, perhaps the best solution is to set up a cronjob that pulls from the grammar repository and leaves the grammars on antlr.org's disk so that /grammars URI points at that directory. That way, the URIs would always be up-to-date with the repository and without me having to do any work. Heh, that just might work. <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/grammars">http://www.antlr.org/grammars</A> by itself could redirect to the github project.

Anyway, If you have any thoughts on this stuff, please reply.

Terence

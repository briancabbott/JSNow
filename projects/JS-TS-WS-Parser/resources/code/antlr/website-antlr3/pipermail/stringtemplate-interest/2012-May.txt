	passing params through iteration
Message-ID: <CALFoTFLo9PSZZteom2d3GUwj5-jsVzPhbvF7U8dpGCFz9Pqoew@mail.gmail.com>

I've got a list called outputs, and I want to have the outputMethod()
applied to it, but I have another attribute from the enclosing
template I would like to pass to each invocation of outputMethod.

The template to call is like this:

outputMethod(var, parentName)::=<<
...
>>

I'm trying to invoke it over the outputs list:

$outputs:{it | $outputMethod(it, parentName)$};separator="\n"$

or

$outputs, parentName:{it | $outputMethod(it, parentName)$};separator="\n">


I can't figure out the correct syntax for this.  I've tried a number
of different things.  Any ideas?

Thanks,

Monty

I know I can kinda do this via
StringTemplate.setPassThroughAttributes(true), but I was trying to
avoid that.

Thanks,

Hi Monty. hmm?this is correct:

> $outputs:{it | $outputMethod(it, parentName)$};separator="\n"$

what is the error?  have you tried (it, ?)?

I am actually using the angle bracket lexer, don't know if that should
make a difference:

<outputs:{it | <outputMethod(it, parentName)>};separator="\n">


action parse error in group sdk-php line 59; template context is
[PHPChoreography anonymous]

Message-ID: <4FA31775.5070703@cordic.com>

Hi All,

repost of my ST issue (wrongly posted on antlr grp) Also updated my typo 
and stack trace from the prev post after
the replay from Terence Parr.

|public class person
{
     public String name;
     public int age;
     public String getName() { return name; }
     public int getAge() { return age; }
}
|

In my function I create a number of person objects and add it into an list

|ArrayList<person>  arr = new ArrayList<person>()
arr.add(person1);
arr.add(person2); etc etc
|

in the string template group file I have got

|test(arr) ::=<<
  <table>
  $arr {a|
  <tr><td>$a.name$</td><td>$a.age$</td></tr>
  }$
  </table>
>>
|

this is called from my list template

|list (arr) ::=<<

$test(arr)$

... and other page details etc
>>
|

in version4 for I get template not found message with some stack trace 
as follows

|W/System.err(580):<string>  669:21: 'arr' came as a complete surprise to me
  no such template: /test
  passed 1 arg(s) to template null with 0 declared arg(s)
|

but I can list an array as follows and it prints the object 
representation in string format (also I can use a map - ie key value 
pairs works ok too)

in string template

|test(arr) :: =<<
  <p>
  $arr; seperator="</br>"$
  </p>
>>
|

how do we iterate list of object to print field values using string 
template grop in V4 am I using it in a wrong format/syntax?

any help/points would be greateful

*note: we set $ as delimiter using new STGroupString("", templateGroup, 
'$', '$');*

That is soooo weird. OH! if you are using angle bracket lexer, that must mean you are using v3. v3 needs you to name those arguments I think.

FYI Google groups can be awkward.  I use it for a few community groups
and right now am dealing with a problem inviting someone to be on the
list, apparently you only get to invite them once.  I see people first
uninvite and then re-invite, but can't see any way to do that through
my interface...just my two cents.

It may work better for groups that let people manage their own
subscriptions instead of being invited.  In general I've not been
impressed with google groups, but I don't have anything better to
recommend either.

Yo yo yo,

For the release of ANTLR v4, I would like to redesign the ANTLR project websites. I really only need 2 pages: homepage and second-level page, which is what I have now.

I contacted the person that did the original design, but she is wisely ignoring my e-mail (since I am a bastard!). Can anyone on the list recommend a designer? That person does not necessarily need to be able to convert the design to html/css, but that would be a bonus. A good looking design is the key. If you have direct experience with or knowledge of a good webpage designer, please contact me directly.

I'm in the process of having an ANTLR project logo built.

Thanks!

I am experimenting with String Template v4.0.5 to create some HTML pages,
but I've run into an issue that I can't seem to find the answer to.  If I
am injecting an object into a template and that object contains other
objects, is there a way to access those other objects' properties? For
example, if I am injecting a User object which has a property Address which
is an object that contains the properties Street, Zip Code, City, and
State, is there any way that I can use User.address.zipCode to access the
Zip Code information? My Address.toString() is called and it inserts all of
the information, but if I want only one property, is there any way to get
it?

Thanks,
Mason

Subject: [stringtemplate-interest] joining attributes with a separator when
	some are optional
Message-ID: <1C448C478A6B4743AF19DBC3C3DCE1320391C3E4B61D@HMS.hm.local>

Hello,

What would be the simplest syntax with StringTemplate to join multiple attributes with a separator without getting too many separators when an attribute is empty/absent/null? This is a use case I encounter very often! I normally solve it in Java using a utility method "joinNonBlank(separator, String... strings)" which only concats the non-blank Strings with the given separator.

For example when formatting a person's name or address and certain attributes (e.g. surname prefix, country of address) are optional.

A complete address could be formatted as "<address>\n<zipCode> <city>\n<country>". However, I don't want the separating "\n" in case the country is absent and I don't want the space between zipCode and city if either of them are absent. Similarly a person's name may be formatted as "<firstName> <surNamePrefix> <surName>", but I don't want a separating space in case a field is empty/absent/null.

Below you can find a failing unit test (because of extra spaces) where I would like the personTemplate changed so that it satisfies the test. (Will the solution make a difference if the attributes are part of a Person object as in "<person.firstName> < person.surNamePrefix> < person.surName>"?)

Thank you,
Henno Vermeulen

     @Test
     public void firstNamePrefixSurNameJoinedNonEmpty() {
         // TODO how do we join multiple attributes with a separator?
         String personTemplate = "<firstName> <surNamePrefix> <surName>";

         assertEquals(
                   "Max Planck",
                   new ST(personTemplate).add("firstName", "Max")
                            .add("surName", "Planck").render());
         assertEquals("Einstein",
                   new ST(personTemplate).add("surName", "Einstein").render());
         assertEquals("Albert", new ST(personTemplate)
                   .add("firstName", "Albert").render());
         assertEquals("Johannes Diderik van der Waals",

                            .add("surName", "Waals"), vanDerWaals);

There is a problem in my unit test, the last ", vanDerWaals" should be replaced by ".render()".

I found that "<[firstName, surNamePrefix, surName]; separator=\" \">" seems to work well, however with errors printed to the console for my unit test because they are missing. This can be solved by explicitly setting these to null. So when working with a Person JavaBean we could do something like the following. Unfortunately we still need to explicitly pass nulls instead of empty strings. Perhaps I can create a subtemplate for this and as a bonus also make the separator a parameter of the subtemplate to clean up the syntax a bit.

     static class Person {
         public String firstName;
         public String surNamePrefix;
         public String surName;

         public Person(String firstName, String surNameSurNamePrefix,
                   String surName) {
              this.firstName = firstName;
              this.surNamePrefix = surNameSurNamePrefix;
              this.surName = surName;
         }
     }

     @Test
     public void personFirstNamePrefixSurNameJoinedNonEmpty() {
         String personTemplate =
                   "<[person.firstName, person.surNamePrefix, person.surName]; separator=\" \">";

         assertEquals(
                   "Max Planck",
                   new ST(personTemplate).add("person",
                            new Person("Max", null, "Planck")).render());
         assertEquals(
                   "Einstein",
                   new ST(personTemplate).add("person",
                            new Person(null, null, "Einstein")).render());
         assertEquals(
                   "Albert",
                   new ST(personTemplate).add("person",
                            new Person("Albert", null, null)).render());
         assertEquals(
                   "Johannes Diderik van der Waals",
                   new ST(personTemplate).add("person",
                            new Person("Johannes Diderik", "van der", "Waals"))
                            .render());
     }

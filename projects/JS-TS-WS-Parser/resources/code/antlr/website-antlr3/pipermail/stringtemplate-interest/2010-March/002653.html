<PRE>Hi Terence -

The problem, in that case, is that the model cannot decide what replacement to do because the loop over the things that define waht to replace happens in ST. 
With a &quot;standard two layered design&quot; with a model and templates accessing the model, you don't &quot;get back&quot; this information, unless using a trick like the one I described.

Now, we both know that there are alternatives to that design: One can do a four-layer design (an inner model [layer 1] is used by local templates [layer 2] to create code snippets into a &quot;parts model&quot; [3], which is then assembled by assembly templates [4]). Or a three-layered version, where a coded [3] loop tells the model about the replacements and then uses templates [2] to get information out of the updated model [1].

However, when I did the latter, it got awfully ugly - pieces of SQL code at various levels. As long as the decision about the replacement could be made in a loop that was &quot;very external&quot; to the generated code (in our case, when we simply created trigger code per SQL table), we could &quot;fix up&quot; the model &quot;in time&quot; to return different information through properties (the 3-layered design). Still, this introduced mutable models, where one had to *know* at which time the model was in which state to deliver the correct replacements.

When, however, those loops had to be multiplied at a more than one place with boilerplate SQL in between, we'd have needed a 4-layered design ... and that would have been a large rewrite (and redesign) for a seemingly small piece of information.

But I stop here with general arguments ... just show me how, with a standard two-layered design, you can get the output of my example :-) [warning: I might make it more complex if your solution is too easily done, but my example was too much simplified ;-) ... did anyone say I'd have to be fair?]. If we can agree on the result, I'll happily rewrite our code (well, it's a real project, so I might not have the time and money to do it ...).

Regards

Harald

<PRE>The issue with the wildcards is more that I will have stored (by 
whatever means) a template as if it were in a file called (for the sake 
of argument) /a/*/c/*.st (obviously wouldn't work exactly like that on a 
filesystem) with the template header in the file also specifying the 
name with a wildcard as the final element (if that's how it happens to 
be specified), but it would (as I'm currently thinking) be supplied to 
the group when /a/f/c/o was requested (for example) so it would be 
stored as that template. So, assuming that I use loadTemplateFile() to 
get the CompiledST, would that be thrown off by the name not matching. 
Let's ignore the * - let's assume that there's some other wildcard that 
could be parsed as the name of a template when not as an expression in a 
template. Would that throw off the compilation if the group thinks the 
name of the template is X and the template file says it's Z, to get the 
question down to its most essential element.

Template code should never have wildcards in it. Any time a template is 
being invoked, there'd be no wildcards.

In terms of multiple matches, I'm making sure there's a defined 
precedence, with the highest-precedence match being used. Also not 
planning to use import, so not considering it a high priority to figure 
out the mechanics of. A helper class tied in to the engine of the 
application (pulling together different sources of data being a main 
role of the application) would act as a resolver for the requests for 
specific templates not yet known to the group, and return the string of 
the 'template file' that's the best match.

So, all in all, yes, sounds like STGroupDir is the best bet to override, 
though I'm a little unsure still about the best method of getting the 
CompiledST for load(String). It feels like it's 
loadTemplateFile(String,String,CharStream), but then there's the 
question of whether the unqualifiedFileName and the name in the 
CharStream have to match, and if either have to match what the Group 
thinks the template is called (as it will always be looking up a defined 
name, while the stored templates will have wildcards in). Is it 
important to have these match? If so, some substitution magic can be 
done prior to supplying the data, while otherwise that substitution is 
some coding and processing that would add nothing.

As far as the group is concerned, it will have a fully-defined template 
name (no wildcards) and it will ask this outside source for a template 
file (might not really be a file) to satisfy it. My two concerns are 
with the fact the declaration in the file might not match the expected 
name, and wondering about the memory and processing inefficiencies of 
having the same template under potenitally dozens of names. Depending on 
how important the name is when loadTemplateFile processes it. Looking at 
it, it seems that I may want to move the name-matching into the group, 
because the names would seem to matter, thanks to rawGetTemplate... I 
presume that parser.templateDef(prefix) calls a method in the group to 
store the template, which is then retrieved and returned in 
loadTemplateFile, and the names used are derived from both the supplied 
filename and the file content... so maybe it needs peeling back a layer 
further, or I can do substitution. I don't know. I'll have to give this 
more thought. The question really, that I have to answer myself, is 
where to put the resolution in and how the group should store things. It 
could be pre-populated with templates, except I want it to be possible 
to extend at run-time. I see now more options than I first thought.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /a/foo/c were used. I'd end up with effective duplication of the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concrete names and otherwise identical. Is there any way to avoid

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these are each duplicated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4 times (and there being another couple of dozen templates that aren't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> duplicated at all) - what order of magnitude of extra memory or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> processing burden is there likely to be? My instinct is it wouldn't be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> too bad.

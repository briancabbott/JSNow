<PRE>I'm new to StringTemplate and am trying to write a code generation phase of a simple IDL compiler using it, but I have to say I'm struggling with how to structure things.



I'm using ANTLR to parse my IDL and I build an object model representing the IDL (perhaps this is where my problem lies, perhaps I should stick with AST and tree parsers etc). But anyway, I have an object model consisting of, roughly Module objects which have a list of Declarations, a Declaration can be a Module or a Struct. A Struct has a list of Member declarations, which of which has a name and a type, being a instance of a Type. A Struct is a Type, and there is a PrimitiveType class with instances for each or the primitive types in my IDL language definition. Fairly simple facilities.



There seem to be two basic approaches to doing the code generation using StringTemplate, but both seem to have issues - so far things aren't completely falling out naturally as I thought they might. I was hoping someone with more experience might shed some wisdom.

The &quot;top down&quot; approach seems like it's working best so far. Here the Java code makes one call to a base template passing in the root Module object, and code generation relies on the template using introspection to get the name of the module and the containing declarations etc, and using template application on the list of declarations to recursively call other templates. There are issues though, such as when I need to alter the code being generated based on whether a Type is a PrimitiveType or, say, a Struct.  I can do so much with indirect template references (calling a template from a name in an attribute), but I can only do this once - I can't do complex template name construction, only take the name of the template from an attribute, not prefix it with something. And if I want to do one thing for PrimitiveTypes and another thing for all other types, then this again becomes hard.



It almost seems as though I need to create another object model to drive my code generation, to more directly reflect the Java/C++ code being generated, rather than trying to drive my code generator off the &quot;generic&quot; IDL object model, but this doesn't seem an appealing design choice.



The &quot;bottom up&quot; approach is to walk the tree in java code and instantiate StringTemplate objects from the bottom that then get set as attributes (multi valued) on higher up templates. This seems more restrictive in that the structure of the generated code is dependent on how the tree is walked, which makes retargetting to another output language harder, or even just changing how I want to generate the code. It also limits what's actually in the template to very little, and seems to make the template almost superfluous.



The &quot;bottom up&quot; approach though seems more in line with Terrence's &quot;push&quot; philosophy of pushing the attributes into the template, whereas the &quot;top down&quot; approach seems to be a &quot;pull&quot; model, which is considered less desirable. However the &quot;top down&quot; approach seems in my case to be yielding more progress.



I don't think my mind has yet grasped how to best work with StringTemplate.



Any perls of wisdom anyone can share, even if it's just a pointer to open source projects where similar things have been done. I've tried to get my mind around ANTLRs code generation, but without much enlightenment so far that I can bring to bear on this. All of the other examples I've seen don't seem to scale to my example.



Thanks in advance for any help!

Subject: [stringtemplate-interest] Iterating over a map
Message-ID: <4251CCE1.20902@egressive.com>

Hi All,

I was just wondering: what is the rationale for having an iteration over 
a Map iterate over its values? For example, I would like to generate an 
HTML definition list for key (thing being defined) to value (definition 
of the thing). How can I do this when iteration over the map is an 
iteration over its values?

If iteration was over the entry set, I could then access to the keys and 
the values at the same time, using a template like this:

<dl>
$map:{  <dt>$it.key$</dt>
   <dd>$it.value$</dd>
}$</dl>

Or am I missing something?

Cheers,

Tom

Hi.  I've spoken with Marq and he is essentially done...he just needs 
time to put into the depot and I can launch it.

Hi Tom...sorry I missed this...somehow I didn't get email from the 
list.  I switched my emails; all should be cool now.

THe rationale is that it is iteratable according to java.  Couldn't 
think of a useful override, so I left it ;)

No, you are right!  The only problem is that I'd have to create a 
"temp" object with fields key/value for each iteration.  I guess that's 
not so bad...I like it!  Ok, i'm putting on my to do list!

By the way, did you know you could do this:

st.setAttribute("someValues.{key,value}", "Tom", "Cool");

??  Pretty cool, eh?  You can then iterate as you indicated below. :)

No sweat!

That's fair enough.

I have some working code, if you're interested.

I basically used entrySet() rather than values() in 
ASTExpr.convertAnythingIterableToIterator(), this means iterator 
expressions are now iterating over Map.Entrys, which thankfully have 
getKey() and getValue(), so everything behaves as you might expect.

There is a snag though: The implementation of Map.Entry (for a HashMap 
at least) is not a public class, so you can't invoke the getKey() and 
getValue() method using reflection because the method is not accessible. 
I found this quite surprising. I had to write an extra method to make a 
public method declared by a public interface, but implemented by a 
non-public class accessible. [Sorry, this was maybe more detail than you 
wanted to know ;-)]

Cheers,

Tom

Subject: [stringtemplate-interest] Python StringTemplate port released!
Message-ID: <10c99fde5629864e2e3a947e1cb99f3e@cs.usfca.edu>

Howdy,

Marq Kole has worked very hard to produce the Python port of 
StringTemplate 2.1 including a rewrite of the documentation to describe 
the Python usage.  It looks *really* nice.  Please check it out and 
spread the word to python fans

http://www.stringtemplate.org/

StringTemplate now has Java, C# (by Steve Sarandos), and Python (Marq 
Kole) implementations!  [Next step: World domination!  Er...I was 
supposed to just mutter than under my breath...was that my outside 
voice?] ;)

Regards,
Ter

Hi -
here are a few thoughts on that - although I'm not sure I understand your problem in all its generality.

First, if nobody looks at the generated code and you do not need perfectly optimized code, just leave the redundant pieces in there (we do SQL code generation of SQL views and Stored Procedures with 1000 - and at times 10000s - of code lines each; and we rely on the database planner to optimize out the unnecessary parts).

Second, it seems to me that your template is of the form

if (
    $Permutations:{(foo = "$it.Id1$"...$it.Id1$...$it.Id2$...$it.Id3$};sep="|"$
then
    sendMoney("me")

Now, your "Permutations" enumeration (e.g. a List<>) can be filled with any algorithm that provides the right permutations. One idea would be to use a standard permutations generator and add a filter to the output that removes permutations equivalent to already present ones - but this is outside the stringtemplate problem space ...

Third, I suspect that also your expressions are created from a model - which would be some sort of tree or list or whatever captures the intention of the expressions. In that case, your "Permutations" generator would not only create "value list permutations", but "complete expressions-with-value permutations" from a single input expression model plus a value list; but again we are outside the stringtemplate problem domain ... mhm ... maybe you get the idea, if not, we'd have to talk more deeply about your real problem specification.

Regards
Harald

A closer look at the documentation reveals how StringTemplate introspects
the members of "Permutations" in this case (i.e., introspects the elements
of a List<>), which clarifies this example. It is now working for me exactly
as expected, thanks to your suggested template :).

One thing about:

if (
   $Permutations:{(foo =
"$it.Id1$"...$it.Id1$...$it.Id2$...$it.Id3$};sep="|"
then
   sendMoney("me")

It seems to me that, written this way, the length of the List<> and the
number of fields of each of its elements needs to be known at template
creation time. At the risk of asking another newbie question, how can the
template be written to handle cases where there may be an $it.Id4$ ...
$it.IdN$ and yield a well formed, balanced, and syntactically valid
expression? In other words, what is the template notation to expand a
variable length List<> into a compound expression like this one? This seems
to be something that is well within the StringTemplate problem domain. Maybe
the answer is obvious and I haven't seen it in the documentation yet because
I haven't read the whole thing.

Hi! :)
Sorry I have been so bad about e-mail delays recently...I've got my head stuck in ANTLR world.

Anyway, my first reaction is that permutation is something that only the model can know.  for your list 1, 2, 3 only the model knows the semantics. That said, just like reverse and strip and so on, we could easily implement a permutation function.  But, where do we draw the line and make the user pass in the data in the right order? Part of the reason that I think it's part of the model, however, is that ST can't know which permutation you want? I.e., there are multiple possible orders. What if you don't want one or two of the permutations? that starts to sound like a model issue.

Can you create a permutation method that returns the appropriate permutation? Then just pass that into ST. Remember, ST is just trying to spit out text surrounding your data... you have to give the data even if that data is something simple and boring like a list of numbers in the appropriate order.

just my perhaps overly academic view... ;)

Mr. Parr,

We posted the initial question without having read past page one of the
StringTemplate documentation. Shame on us. We did this to see if we could
leap-frog some of the reading. But a closer look at the doc does show how
StringTemplate takes in different data structures and introspects the
elements. Now that we've read a little more, the boundaries of
StringTemplate's problem space are more clear, and of course we can write a
permutation method.

And let me just say that my colleage and I are huge fans. Huge. Little did
we know that in posting to this forum, we would get a response, from, the,
man. In closing, and in deep appreciation of your taking the time to respond
to our humble little question, picture us, like Wayne and Garth, saying,
repeatedly: "we're not worthy".

We're not worthy,

Alex + Paul

Subject: [stringtemplate-interest] Top-down or bottom up
Message-ID: <180F9DC4E61F4E4DA742A2200BFE361040BD57C1A3@IE2RD2XVS021.red002.local>

I'm new to StringTemplate and am trying to write a code generation phase of a simple IDL compiler using it, but I have to say I'm struggling with how to structure things.



I'm using ANTLR to parse my IDL and I build an object model representing the IDL (perhaps this is where my problem lies, perhaps I should stick with AST and tree parsers etc). But anyway, I have an object model consisting of, roughly Module objects which have a list of Declarations, a Declaration can be a Module or a Struct. A Struct has a list of Member declarations, which of which has a name and a type, being a instance of a Type. A Struct is a Type, and there is a PrimitiveType class with instances for each or the primitive types in my IDL language definition. Fairly simple facilities.



There seem to be two basic approaches to doing the code generation using StringTemplate, but both seem to have issues - so far things aren't completely falling out naturally as I thought they might. I was hoping someone with more experience might shed some wisdom.

The "top down" approach seems like it's working best so far. Here the Java code makes one call to a base template passing in the root Module object, and code generation relies on the template using introspection to get the name of the module and the containing declarations etc, and using template application on the list of declarations to recursively call other templates. There are issues though, such as when I need to alter the code being generated based on whether a Type is a PrimitiveType or, say, a Struct.  I can do so much with indirect template references (calling a template from a name in an attribute), but I can only do this once - I can't do complex template name construction, only take the name of the template from an attribute, not prefix it with something. And if I want to do one thing for PrimitiveTypes and another thing for all other types, then this again becomes hard.



It almost seems as though I need to create another object model to drive my code generation, to more directly reflect the Java/C++ code being generated, rather than trying to drive my code generator off the "generic" IDL object model, but this doesn't seem an appealing design choice.



The "bottom up" approach is to walk the tree in java code and instantiate StringTemplate objects from the bottom that then get set as attributes (multi valued) on higher up templates. This seems more restrictive in that the structure of the generated code is dependent on how the tree is walked, which makes retargetting to another output language harder, or even just changing how I want to generate the code. It also limits what's actually in the template to very little, and seems to make the template almost superfluous.



The "bottom up" approach though seems more in line with Terrence's "push" philosophy of pushing the attributes into the template, whereas the "top down" approach seems to be a "pull" model, which is considered less desirable. However the "top down" approach seems in my case to be yielding more progress.



I don't think my mind has yet grasped how to best work with StringTemplate.



Any perls of wisdom anyone can share, even if it's just a pointer to open source projects where similar things have been done. I've tried to get my mind around ANTLRs code generation, but without much enlightenment so far that I can bring to bear on this. All of the other examples I've seen don't seem to scale to my example.



Thanks in advance for any help!

Subject: [stringtemplate-interest] DefaultTemplateLexer in C#
Message-ID: <4BE71842.2030102@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm new to StringTemplate. I've found it very useful for my work. I've 
found it also easy to learn and haven't any problems until now (started 
using it 2 weeks ago).

I have an issue with delimiters: I would like to change delimiters for 
*.stg files to dollars as I'm working with html files.
To do so I'm trying something like this:
     group = new StringTemplateGroup(new StringReader(s), 
typeof(DefaultTemplateLexer());

Unfortunately DefaultTemplateLexer is not defined, only 
AngleBracketTemplateLexer is available.
I've got following version of library:
      
http://www.stringtemplate.org/download/StringTemplate-3.2-2009-06-28.7z

It seems for me as a bug, because DefaultTemplateLexer is documented and 
does not exist in Antlr3.StringTemplate.dll (I've verified this with 
ildasm).
On the other hand $ delimiter is handled correctly in *.st files so 
DefaultTemplateLexer must exist somehow (I've found only private class 
_defaultTemplateLexer).
Also other people are using this from a long time and nobody noticed 
this issue earlier?

So I'm not sure if there is a bug or I don't know something important.
Anyway, how to set $ delimiter for *.stg files?

I've found description "StringTemplate v3.2 binaries for .NET framework 
<http://www.stringtemplate.org/download/StringTemplate-3.2-2009-06-28.7z>" 
while assembly info shows version 3.1.0.0. Maybe link is incorrect?

I've also tried to get a source to find DefaultTemplateLexer class and 
compile library myself. This is not as simple as it seems to be.
Command:

Hi. That is pretty strange. I did not build the C# version and Kunle is no longer working on the project so I'm not sure what to do.  any looked in this source bucket:

Subject: [stringtemplate-interest] String Template
Message-ID: <4BEEEEAE.2090506@clapper.org>

I'm building a small application that uses StringTemplate, and I find I need to
do on-the-fly aggregate creation. StringTemplate supports that capability, but
I need to be able to create aggregates with more than five values. I can't
pre-create the aggregate, because the contents of the aggregate depend on a
file passed in by the user. (The application is written in Scala, so it uses
the Java StringTemplate API, thus the restriction on a maximum of five
parameters when creating an aggregate.)

The restriction on five elements in an on-the-fly aggregate is problematic. If
the setAttribute() method taking an Object array were public, I could simply
call that. However, it is protected. Morever, given that StringTemplate
instances are created via factory methods in StringTemplateGroup, it does not
appear feasible to extend StringTemplate with a subclass.

Is there a reason the setAttribute() method taking Object[] is protected, or
can it be made public? If it must be protected, is there another solution to my
problem (short of generating bytecode on the fly, which is doable, but a last
resort)?

hi. I'm not really sure what you're asking specifically. I think you can Create a template and insert it into attribute Page in the master. ST will evaluate it as necessary.

 can you simply pass things in as an array of objects?

hmm... one I pass in a Map from name to value?

 I suppose it could be made public.   you could override it and I can't remember why I made it protected thoug.

Sure, if that were available as an option.

Yes. I neglected to mention one thing: The data values specified by the user
can be in properties format. Thus, "foo.bar" is legitimate. I want the user to
be able to use the same name in the template, e.g., $foo.bar$. I'm currently
mapping things like "foo.bar" into $fooBar$, but that's suboptimal, from a
user-interface standpoint.

Yeah, unfortunately, '.' is a special operator in ST and you can use it in identifier names

No big deal. I solved my particular problem by subclassing StringTemplate and
StringTemplateGroup. The result works perfectly.

Subject: [stringtemplate-interest] Separation issue
Message-ID: <4BFA5D00.9080400@clapper.org>

I have an model/view separation issue with String Template. Let me call it the
Tag Cloud Problem. I'm curious to know the "recommended" way to solve this
problem.

BACKGROUND

Consider a blog generator that uses String Template. Content is converted from
simple markup files to HTML via String Template templates. So far, so good.

The simple markup files can have tags. The conversion engine presents
templates with a map of files ("articles") that are associated with each tag.
Conceptually, the template receives a list of Tag elements containing the
following properties:

- tag name
- list of Summary Article objects (with title, link, etc., properties)
- a "totalArticles" numeric property (the length of the Summary Articles list)

I'd like to use that information to generate a tag cloud.

THE PROBLEM

Ideally, I'd like to map tag frequency to a CSS class, so that the CSS styling
can style popular tags differently from less-popular one. For instance:

more than 20 articles -> CSS class is "huge"
11-20 articles -> CSS class is "big"
6-10 articles -> CSS class is "normal"
2-5 articles -> CSS class is "small"
1 article -> CSS class is "tiny"

The corresponding CSS elements can then style those classes appropriately, to
produce the typical tag-cloud look.

To me, the transformation from "number of associated articles" to "CSS class"
belongs in the template, primarily because that transformation is
HTML-specific. If I'm generating XML (e.g., RSS), I'll do something different
(or nothing at all).

After digging through the String Template documentation, I see no easy way to
isolate the logic in the templates. The "if" statement only supports boolean
property access (or presence/absence). I can't map "number of articles" to a
CSS class using the template's "if" logic. I could push the test into a
renderer, but that approach seems wrong, for a couple reasons:

- It pushes view logic into Java code (conversion of total to CSS class).
- A user can't easily change that conversion without writing Java code.

It's entirely possible that I am missing something obvious here. What's the
standard or recommended way to handle this kind of view-specific conversion in
String Template?

You don't want the size range in the model because it's something the  
designer might want to tweak right?

You can add a size scale to the model that the view can use. Two easy  
options:

1. Add a fourth attribute like scale = floor(totalArticles / 5).  Then  
use css attributes like size$scale$ so size1, size2, etc instead of  
big and huge.  Use a formula with log and a scale factor to get  
results that will accomodate growth.

2. Use a number renderer to implement this same formula but with an  
explicit scale factor:  size$scale; format="..."$ so you still get the  
same css labels and you can adjust the scale from the view when needed.

These are reasonable suggestions, though they still put view-specific logic
outside the view, in my opinion. The arbitrary partitioning of discrete numeric
values into CSS thresholds, for the purposes of styling, strikes me as
view-specific. Ideally, I'd like to isolate the logic completely within the
template.

Using (abusing) the "format" capability is another option.

I've found a solution.
I've decompiled dll with Reflector. It appeared that class which I need 
is named just TemplateLexer, not DefaultTemplateLexer as in java version.
I hope that this info can be helpful for somebody else.

Regards,

Robert

How stable is the source?  If I did a fresh pull and build would I be in a
good place or .. ?

Thanks -andy

PS:  excuse the possible double post, my mail reader did some weird things
for some reason.

Subject: [stringtemplate-interest] Implements and inherits
Message-ID: <BLU139-W1360A2C87920A42190F7EEBCEE0@phx.gbl>


Hello there,
I would like to organize my template files. I have two different groups, that are doing sometimes the same thing. I want to organize my project as follows : - an interface file, that defines the templates to implement, at the top of my hierarchy- a group that implements this interface, and at the same time provides the templates that are repeating in my two original group. (The group is then a kind of abstract class?)- the two original groups, inheriting the previous group, and implementing the remaining templates.
Is this kind of structure possible ? I didn't achieve to set the second group, which is a sort of interface but with non-empty templates.
The first is an interface, for sure. The second should be an interface as well, but the ST "compiler" doesn't let me fill the templates I want to regroup.
Hope I'm clear.
Thanks in advance,Dam.

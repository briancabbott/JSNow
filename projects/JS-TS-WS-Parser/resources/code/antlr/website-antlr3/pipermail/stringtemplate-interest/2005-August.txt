Howdy,

I finally managed to clone antlr.org so it makes a standalone  
StringTemplate site:

http://www.stringtemplate.org/

It's a bit sparse. ;)  Feel free to add your testimonials or showcase  
or whatever... you can do so by hitting the "More" link from the main  
page and then the "add" button.

Subject: [stringtemplate-interest] Missing convenience ctor in
	StringTemplateGroup(?)
Message-ID: <9da4f452050815102652f8c1ed@mail.gmail.com>

I thought it might be convenient to have something that resolves the
file a group is specified in in the same way as with string templates.
While now you can use the ctor

public StringTemplateGroup(Reader r)

to make clear that the group is specified in a file, something like
that might be more convenient:

public StringTemplateGroup(String name, boolean groupFormat);

Right now I saw myself forced to write something like 

	static Reader getGroup(String name) {
		ClassLoader cl = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
		InputStream is = cl.getResourceAsStream(name + ".stg");
		if (is == null) {
			return null;
		}
		BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is));
		return reader;
	}

to map the name to a reader. 

Why isn't this part of StringTemplate?

Or did I get it all wrong?

Thanks for any hints/comments and cheers

Oliver

Message-ID: <a5094ed905081708363cdb5d07@mail.gmail.com>

Does anyone mind if I add the mailing list to gmane.org <http://gmane.org>? 
Even though it the current archive is small, the interface is crude. Gmane 
will provide a better (searchable) interface for future posts.

Hi Mike.  Confluence has an email archiver; example:

http://www.antlr.org/wiki/spaces/viewmailarchive.action?key=ds

Anybody object to me putting antlr and stringtemplate interest into  
separate lists?  Confluence will make it searchable etc... :)

Hi,

The mailing lists antlr-interest and stringtemplate-list will now be  
archived on the confluence-based wiki.  Well, I hope.  These messages  
should be the first. :)

Hi,

Just a reminder that the workshop is being held again this year  
(hosted / cosponsored by BEA systems) here in San Francisco:

http://www.cs.usfca.edu/ANTLR2005.shtml

We are about half full already so starting thinking about signing up  
if you are planning on coming.  Only 35 people will fit in the room.

It will be lots of fun; very informal, but full of info.  Lots of  
ANTLR users just talking about their projects and me talking about  
various applications and future stuff.  I'm even trying to get  
Eclipse to send people to talk about ANTLR use/integration or other  
language use etc... in Eclipse.  Who else from industry would be a  
reasonable person to speak?

You can either just come and listen or you can do a quick 10 or 15  
minute presentation on what you've been playing with or thinking  
about; longer if you want.

We have 3 international folks coming so far even. :)

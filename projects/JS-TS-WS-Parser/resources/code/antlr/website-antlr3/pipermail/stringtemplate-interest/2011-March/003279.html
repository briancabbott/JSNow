<PRE>I don&#8217;t know &#8211; there seems to be something fundamentally wrong with asking
NOT to add characters to the output; even the grammar of describing that
seems wrong; sort of like the &#8220;It is not unlikely that..&#8221; It almost feels
like there should be nothing added unless you tell it to.  So you have to
explicitly ask for a &lt;\n&gt; or you just plain don&#8217;t get them. Also, we should
make sure that the newlines are consistent on Linux vs Windows; all \n or
\r\n or perhaps force one or the other.



The new line issue is a thorny one &#8211; I am not sure that there is a perfect
answer, but I am sure that whatever the choice is, there will be someone
that thinks it is wrong ;-)



But:



::<i>=
</I>
&lt;&lt;

fred

harry

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>


goes to: fredharry



seems logical to me. I can instantly see that it isn&#8217;t what I wanted, so I
must need to tell it something:



::<i>=
</I>
&lt;&lt;

&lt;\n&gt;

fred      &lt;\n&gt;

harry                           &lt;\n&gt;

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>

behavior



 are you sure you don't like the &lt;\\&gt;?

Introducing this feature would be fine with me. It is then up to the
judgement of the developer not to use it if he thinks it is too confusing or
error prone.



In addition I support Sam's request to add a &quot;line&quot; extension in a template
definition (x ::= line &lt;&lt;).



Up to now I haven't had the need for *nested* regions, but I guess when
templates get more complicated and especially with the &quot;line&quot; feature this
could be a very useful extension.



These changes would cover all &quot;whitespace related&quot; issues I know of or at
least give me a reasonable way to work around them.

The templates this affects are already very long. It'd only be more

I split a line,



But most of the time we don't have to split lines, right?



plus adding characters makes it that much more difficult to
distinguishing actual output from non-output.



I got the same impression. it's hard to see &lt;\\&gt; amid all of the noise.
let's look at an example.  so that it doesn't wrap, here is an image



&lt;PastedGraphic-1.tiff&gt;



It would be nice to say wrap it like this perhaps:



public static class &lt;ruleDescriptor:returnStructName()&gt; &lt;\\&gt;

  extends &lt;if(TREE_PARSER)&gt;Tree&lt;else&gt;Parser&lt;endif&gt;RuleReturnScope {



Hmm.. the &lt;\\&gt; doesn't seem too bad to me in this case. I would love to use
just \\ but of course ST would have to ignore that. What if we came up with
some wacky special characters? well, I like the consistency of ignoring
everything outside of angle brackets.



 are you sure you don't like the &lt;\\&gt;?

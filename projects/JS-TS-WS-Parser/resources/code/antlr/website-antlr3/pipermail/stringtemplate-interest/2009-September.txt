How about subclassing ST and overriding setAttribute to wrap all null

Your solution is clever :)  might try the setAttribute though.

Hello,

Does the String Template class support turning off a template within another
template?

For instance say I have a template that contains another template -
%MA_TEMPLATE%

DT $OFFICE$ $GEO$ $TIME$ $SEQ$  %MA_TEMPLATE%

Where * MA_TEMPLATE is*
/MA $NBR$

I want to be able to turn off MA_TEAMPLATE if the data element NEEDS_MA =
false

So if NEEDS_MA = true - the result after substituting the values is

DT HDL SHB 160337  026A  /MA 003

If NEEDS_MA = fase - the result after substituting the values is

DT HDL SHB 160337  026A
How would I do that with the String Template  Is this possible?

Awaiting your response

Thanks a lot
Sundar.

are you passing in a boolean or string? if string, it won't work as  
you want.

Subject: [stringtemplate-interest] Using StringTemplate with Java,

Message-ID: <4AA2CD17.5020100@gerrard.net>

Can I simply pass a Java object (JavaBean perhaps) along and have 
StringTemplate interrogate it for the properties to substitute into the 
template?

I'm just starting with StringTemplate and can't find this in the doc, 
even if it's a legitimate use of StringTemplate.

I'd rather not have to write the mechanical code to simply pull property 
values from the Java object and set them with setAttribute(...)

Regards,

Chris

sure.  <o.methods> or <o.fields>.

i'd avoid it for large projects; use a model to traverse reflection  
api and pass in data you need.

works great for small examples.

Hi. Are you saying that you want to process the same data with  
multiple templates? or are you saying you want a template to be  
sensitive to the kind of data it's applied to?

Hi Brian,

Well, ST of the model really. It's up to you to provide a controller  
that reads from the model and pushes into the template. you could do  
something like $node.x$ where node is a node in the XML tree and then  
property x would be the child named x. you could fake out ST this way  
to make it read xml tree data.

Remember though that you really don't want to do processing in the  
templates and by walking collocated XML data structures, you're kind  
of combining the model/controller with the view.

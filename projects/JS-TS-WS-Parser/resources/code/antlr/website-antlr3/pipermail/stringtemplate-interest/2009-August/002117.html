Yeah, that's a good point. perhaps dynamic versus static is the way to  
say it rather than side effect. but, by no side effects, do I mean  
repeatability? Hmm... I wonder what pure functional languages due to  
get the current time? does anybody know? Weird, I see some things on  
the web about getting the current working directory and changing the  
current directory, clear side effects. perhaps you have to do in one  
of those weird monad things.

Yeah, makes me nervous, but I could put in the advanced features  
&quot;beware&quot; type stuff. Also it's not like it's built into the language  
so people who make tostring return a different value each time know  
they are making a nonrepeatable thing.

In your next e-mail you suggest sugar to make it easier. Part of me  
wants to leave it as &quot;do it only few know what you're doing&quot; and  
syntax would make people use it. On the other hand, if it has a known  
bit of syntactic sugar with known semantics, we discourage people from  
doing all sorts of weird things manually in the model and passing them  
in. Hmm...

I thought about doing something like

labels ::= {label&lt;it&gt;}

which presumably would give you a new label every time you reference  
&lt;labels&gt;.

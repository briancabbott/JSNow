<PRE>&gt;<i> So here we go/you&#8217;ve inspired me. :) For syntax highlighting, view in HTML.
</I>
Wouv i'm glad, thats great, &#160;;)

I still don't have access to repository and can't see actual code.
Prof. Parr could you please set up a readonly account for me to access
ST#3 code?

Btw, it would be great if expressions are compiled during parsing. As
i didn't want to modify ST code myself, i choosed another way. I'm
creating a set of dynamic methods/CompiledTemplate objects given a set
of StringTemplate/StringTemplateGroup objects. So when the template is
going to be converted to string with a new set of attributes by means
of compiledTemplate.GetInstanceOf().ToString(), there won't be any
dynamic compilation at this stage, just calls to dynamic methods. You
are not generating dynamic methods on evaluation stage each time a
template instance is converted to string, do you? It would be very
slow, because of the way ILGenerator works (probably you don't, i
couldn't have enough time to review code yet).

I would like to point in some performance bottlenecks that i
discovered during my development. Might be helpful if you are planning
to keep on doing compilations / optimizations.

- Anonymous templates (and most named templates) usually only have one
(or none) argument, &quot;it&quot; or a named variant of it e.g. &quot;x&quot;. And there
is also
&quot;i&quot; and &quot;i0&quot; special variables. Even when a template access only these
attributes, a dictionary lookup is still required. And dictionary
lookup is slow (yes O(1) but still 10x slower than a direct variable
lookup). They should be treated specially in special template
variables. I did this for compiled templates and it helped a lot.
Templates with a single argument can also be treated specially.

- Options like separator, format, null, anchor etc. are all string
templates, even when they just contains of a constant simple string
(And most of the time like %99 they are constants). When they are
constants, they should also be treated specially.

- There is a list called EmbeddedInstances in each StringTemplate.
This list is not used anywhere, grows each time a template is
converted to a string and it prevents garbage collection of template
instances. Don't know if your port has them, but if it does, should be
removed.

- ASTExpr.ApplyListOfAlternatingTemplates is called even when there is
only one template and it has array lookup/modulus overheads. Also it
creates an array of templates for each element and returns that array
as results may be applied to another template, but most of the time
they don't. May be optimized by looking ahead in the expression tree
to see if there is an upcoming template application.

Makes sense so far...

</I>&gt;<i> them do), the actions
</I>&gt;<i> on the &quot;templates&quot; Map in StringTemplateGroup are performed by  
</I>&gt;<i> multiple threads
</I>&gt;<i> and without synchronization =&gt; threading issue, as HashMap cannot  
</I>&gt;<i> cope reliably with
</I>&gt;<i> multiple threads accessing it in parallel.
</I>
I see.  Yes, the group of templates could be unsafe due to caching.   
If all templates are loaded up front then this would be avoided I  
suppose.  Technically though you are absolutely correct.  Loading of  
templates is not safe.  Shall I wrap the Map in a thread-safety thing  
or just use Hashtable?

&gt;<i> Once st.write(...) gets called, an ASTExpr may need to access the  
</I>&gt;<i> property of some object,
</I>&gt;<i> so it calls StringTemplateGroup's getCachedClassProperty and maybe  
</I>&gt;<i> later cacheClassProperty.
</I>&gt;<i> Both of these static methods access the &quot;classPropertyCache&quot; static  
</I>&gt;<i> Map, again w/o synchronization,
</I>&gt;<i> although multiple servlet threads may invoke these operations in  
</I>&gt;<i> parallel =&gt; another threading issue.
</I>
Yes, I just *knew* that would cause trouble...i'm thinking of taking  
out..not sure it's worth the complexity.

&gt;<i> StringTemplateGroup's attributeRenderers Map can be replaced or  
</I>&gt;<i> renderers can be added to it
</I>&gt;<i> without synchronization. If a servlet's thread later calls  
</I>&gt;<i> getAttributeRenderer, again w/o sync,
</I>&gt;<i> one would assume that it should be able to access those renderers  
</I>&gt;<i> right away, but this assumption
</I>&gt;<i> is plain wrong* =&gt; yet another threading issue.
</I>
That is an ordering issue.  The real issue is that a read thread  
could catch a write thread in the act of updating the data structure.
&gt;<i> =&gt; For each mutable state variable in both StringTemplateGroup and  
</I>&gt;<i> StringTemplate that may be
</I>&gt;<i> accessed by more than one thread, all accesses (not just writes,  
</I>&gt;<i> also reads) should be performed
</I>&gt;<i> with the same lock held, so that the variable is guarded by that  
</I>&gt;<i> lock. Ideally, the documentation
</I>&gt;<i> would state which lock has to be used for each variable (important  
</I>&gt;<i> since there are so many protected
</I>&gt;<i> variables that subclasses or other package level classes can access).
</I>
ST objects should be ok.  It's the group, as you point out, that has  
issues.

&gt;<i> I hope this clarifies my concers about ST's tread-safety.
</I>
it does, thanks!

&gt;<i> PS: I know I am somewhat picky about this issue, but we develop  
</I>&gt;<i> heavily threaded systems for
</I>&gt;<i> stock market data feed processing and neglecting thread-safety is  
</I>&gt;<i> just not an option for us :)
</I>
I'm glad you're paranoid then!

Ok, i did this:

o made static maps in STG synchronized, also synchronized the look
up/def methods for templates in STG.

also added a comment on map defs:

	/** Define a map for this group; not thread safe...do not keep adding
	 *  these while you reference them.
	 */

Hmm...I should really do a heavy analysis on the whole STG thing...I  
use it now in a very diff env than the web where all templates are  
loaded via a group file.

How much are synchronized methods slowed down these days for  
uncontentious locks?  I'm worried that I just slowed antlr down.  Did  
I just kill performance?

I think having the core String renderer have a flexible escaping system 
would be ideal; a few common escape types, and them a tr/// or 
s///-style syntax (or comparable), or a system specifying which patterns 
to escape and what character escapes them, and so on. It might not be 
simple, but it means that you don't have to keep adding things as people 
point them out. It's possibly also worth making an extension-point style 
extensibility for the core String renderer - you know, put in a method 
that does nothing but can be inherited, make the first thing the render 
method does be defer to that method, if it returns a String emit it, if 
it returns null carry on with default activity. This allows people to 
extend it without losing the default behaviour. Even more flexible would 
be a way of handling many such delegate methods. The only reason I see 
this as potentially justified is the fact that much more wants to be 
done to Strings than to other types.

</I>
The question is two-part, to me: what should be in group files (as 
opposed to the in-system programming representation) and what should be 
inherited or polymorphic between groups and groups they include. What I 
would see as important is that, if different groups can have different 
renderers and adapters set, it should look at included ones 'first' (or 
only) simply because of the use in modularity. This isn't inheritance in 
the sense it's used in programming, after all. So, for example, you 
could have a group that has an adapter set for SomeClassA, and if that 
group is included then its templates should use SomeClassA; if the 
programmer wants to override that, they can override it in the included 
group as easily as they can in the including one, surely. If the 
including one also has an adapter set for SomeClassA, it should use it 
only in its own templates, allowing modularity to be maintained. The 
question then becomes &quot;what if TemplateA is defined in both?&quot;. This is a 
peril that the programmer must consider when using group inclusion for 
modularity purposes, of course, as such an override might not be what is 
intended, but that's the programmer's lookout. In any case, what would 
happen with the current architecture (AIUI) would seem to be logical 
(though cases can be made for others) - if you override it, that group 
has to know how to adapt or render the class itself. So that's a good 
case, to me, for doing things as Udo suggests.

On the other hand, I can't help feeling that renderers and adapters are 
part of the 'system', or Interpreter, rather than being part of the 
group. You might say I'm in two minds. Perhaps it's worth letting 
programmers do both. Use the Interpreter object to set 'default' 
renderers and adapters, to be used if the defining group doesn't have 
one set; when trying to find the renderer or adapter, first check the 
defining group for the template, and if it doesn't have one set, check 
the interpreter. This allows the programmer to set Interpreter-wide ones 
where appropriate, to save registering the same one everywhere if you 
have lots of groups, yet it also allows it to be set per-group to get 
the behaviour you want. In the event you want a default used (even where 
the default doesn't exist) on a particular group, but have one set in 
the Interpreter, allow groups to store an entry of null - if the group 
has a null adapter/renderer, then don't bother to look at the 
Interpreter, just look directly at defaults.

On the subject of the Interpreter, does it currently support there being 
multiple Interpreters in a single VM? I'd say it should, as there are 
conceivable instances that would lead to it being architecturally 
appropriate, and matches the way most standard APIs work with such 
things IME.

Anyway, just my thoughts.

Sam

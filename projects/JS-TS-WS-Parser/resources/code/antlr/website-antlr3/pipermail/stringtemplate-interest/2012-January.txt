Hi,
I've been trying to figure out from the documentation on the website
whether it's possible to use conditional expressions to test for the
existence of template definitions from within a template.

thanks,
wes

Is there an idiom in StringTemplate for apply a fold operation over a
list?  Let's say I have ["f", "g"].  I'd like to generate f(g()).  I'm
not seeing how to make use of the map operation to accumulate results
recursively into a list to generate the fold operation.  Any ideas?

Hi Wesley,

I suspect that this might be easier if you construct nested templates in your model rather than in the view (templates). But, although it doesn't occur to me exactly how to do this at the moment, using first and rest functions and doing the typical functional programming thing of using recursion to iterate down the list might do it.

maybe you need to call a recursive template that starts with a list of names:

<func(f=first(names), others=rest(names))>

where

func(f,others) ::= "<f>(<func(f=first(others), others=rest(others))>)"

 try something like this.

Hello everyone,

 

To go along with the early releases of ANTLR 4 I've seen floating around,
I'm adding a super early preview release of ANTLRWorks 2. I've started to
put some documentation on the ANTLR wiki, but it's not complete and even
outdated on a number of things (e.g. some screenshots show tree parsers
which are no longer part of v4).

 

Here are a couple of pages with screenshots:

http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR4/2.+Grammar+Editing+Features

http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR4/3.+StringTemplate+4+Editing+Feature
s

 

Here is a link to today's download:

http://www.tunnelvisionlabs.com/downloads/antlr/2012-01-06-antlrworks2-ea.zi
p

 

Primary known issues:

 

.         So far the only real testing has been on my own machine. Expect
many things to go wrong (but hope they don't). :) Definitely pre-alpha
quality.

.         Enabling legacy (v3) mode won't automatically refresh the editor.
(bug)

 

Thanks,

I just uploaded a new preview build of ANTLRWorks 2.

 

I posted the download link as well as some change notes on the ANTLR wiki:

http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR4/1.+Overview

 

I'm definitely interested in any feedback people may have regarding the new
IDE if they are testing it out! :)

seems to be no project type to choose from. Am I just stupid or is this a

It doesn't use a project. Just open a grammar file (or StringTemplate group
file).

You've already got someone syncing to github.
Why not use that instead?

I'm new to both mercurial (1 project) and git (2+ projects).

Eclipse is moving to git.
Linux is git.
I'm not familiar enough with other big players that are using
mercurial. (Maybe the old sun sources...)

I've used bitbucket and github.
Dont really have any opinions since my head space is still stuck in
svn and need more time/practice to get it out.
However I love the idea of
* git stash
* git bisect
I dont know if mercurial has similar commands.

I hate git? because I don't understand it ;) hg was easy and obvious.  mercurial works with intellij (well I hope) so it will be okay for me.

Can you provide specifics?
Since I'm new to both, they both were not obvious with a svn mentality.
hg definitely didn't stand out as being easier than git.

I think you're the first person coming from svn that I've ever heard say that.

Hg has a command set and lingo that's an easier transition from svn/cvs. Git has a command set that is baroque at best and they use their own whacked definition for terms like "branch" that is wildly different from what branch means in pretty much every other scm.

Hg and Git are comparable on a feature basis.

However, Hg and Git are built with very different philosophies. Git is perfectly happy to allow mutation of history. Hg, on the other hand, is very much against rewriting history (but there are extensions that allow for it when you really do need it, if ever).

Github is definitely better than Bitbucket on many things. Now that Atlassian has bought bitbucket, there's hope that the gap will close.

Have fun,
John

Very useful information Kieran. thanks!

I will give hg a test drive and try to keep both in parallel for little while. Of course this has to wait until it bumps up in priority.

I'm using Git for over 2 years now since I switched from SVN. I don't really 
know what there is "baroque" or "whacked definitions", do you care do explain 
a little bit more?

Rewriting history is a good thing, as long as it's not published. For example, 
you can amend commits, if you forgot something, you can re-order commits to 
make your changes more understandable for others, etc. As long as your commits 
are not published to others, who cares if you rewrite your history.

If you would care to share your "reading list" that would be great.
It would benefit me specifically, but also anyone wanting to help out
with the project later that isn't familiar with either Git or
Mercurial.
There is a lot of documentation out there, but having someone else
filter it for quality/understandability is a huge boon.

 well I remember reading Joel's  tutorial at some point

http://hginit.com/

 and just about any other document I could find on the concepts. Once I looked into the distributed revision control thing I realized that it would fit my needs much better than what I've been doing with perforce. I didn't really care about the commands so much. Honestly, I started branching like a maniac in git within an hour after reading the mercurial stuff.

By default, public repositories are not rebase-able. The fact that
something _can_ be achieved should not be held against it.

And locally, if you don't want to rebase, don't. I find that on small,
private-only "feature" branches or "experiment" branches, that rebasing is
a useful tool. So is cherry picking. Knowing when to use a powerful tool is
part of being a good technician/ programmer.

Git was a steep learning curve for me. "Pro Git" book I find excellent.
Bought a paper copy.

I used bitkeeper, arch/tla, and cvs etc. in the past. I think others have
said, but git stash is a godsend, as well as other bits and bobs.

I'm leaning towards git but Sam Harwell, who is super important on this project, using windows and would need good git gui outside of dev tool. Can anybody comment on what is useful (non cmd-line)?

While I primarily use git via cmd line (msysgit) on Win7 I find the gui capabilities of both of the following helpful:

  http://code.google.com/p/gitextensions/
  http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/

Each has a different usage style so play a bit with each to see which style works best for you.

One note regarding rebasing. Although it's almost always a very bad idea to rebase public branches, there are cases (low-end emulation of mercurial's mq via "patch branches") in which it makes a lot of sense and can be managed with proper communication/expectation setting and knowledge of just a few git concepts like `git reset` and `git stash`.

I suppose TortoiseGit would be a good candidate. (to be honest I haven't really tried any others :-))

As a bit more background, I do development on many projects in several
different languages and environments. My "primary" languages are C# and C++
with Visual Studio. For ANTLR and school I also work in Java using IntelliJ
and more recently NetBeans. I always use an external GUI for source control
before checking files in because it gives me extra control in preventing
mistakes when working on someone else's project - I diff every file to
ensure that my code formatting and even whitespace match the settings of
code around my changes. I find that when it specifically comes to checking
files in, IDE integrations can occasionally have "glitches" (unexpected
behavior, nuances, and/or bugs) so I avoid them.

For external tools, I find P4V (Perforce) feature rich but slow and
particularly cumbersome when it comes to experimenting with code checked out
from a read-only repository. Nevertheless, I frequently use it since
Perforce is the chosen SCC for all the commercial projects I've been
involved with. TortoiseHG Workbench has been exceptional (but not perfect),
and has stable, complete support across all of the development environments
I work with. TortoiseSVN is truly polished and performs very well, but
suffers from limitations imposed by SVN itself.

Git concerns me not only for falling behind these in toolchain/GUI support
on Windows, but I also don't see a big movement to close the gap. TortoiseHG
is a particular example of a very actively developed project with frequent
releases.

I can understand wanting to take advantage of GitHub to help the spread of Antlr, StringTemplate, etc.

If you still want to use Hg, you can use hg-git to deal with the interaction with the git(hub) repos. The thing that I've run into with using that is that git is sloppy w.r.t. files with the same name but in different cases (but no project should be doing anything so stupid :-) so you might need to use git directly to fix that.

TortoiseHg has support for hg-git but I've never tried it.

Have fun,
John

Yeah, that's where this conversation started. And, fwiw, I totally concur.

However, to be fair, there's an argument to be made that Github is the hosted repository with the most activity in terms of getting in more users (i.e., it's the most viral).

And yes, I use all three hosting (GC, BB, and GH).

I found SmartGit to be very suitable for our small (non-programmer
besides myself) office. Can't compare with any Hg programs sorry. I
also install and use TortoiseGit.
I haven't tried the latest SmartGits after December 2010. Should be even better.

we know now that honey badger is a bad ass, but will need some
time to grow. So I must use the current version of ANTLR. Is
it possible that you now spent some time and help me to find
the problem?

It appears to me (from trial and error) that one can only call Write on 
a Template instance once and must get a new instance before calling 
again. Is this correct? On the second call ,after a successful first 
call, my error listener receives errors about not being able to find 
variables.

Hi James,

 

The CompiledTemplate (impl) is intended to only be read inside Template.Add.
I'll update it to be safe when impl.HasFormalArgs is false. If you are using
group files (*.stg) or the new template files (*.st with a proper template
header/formal arguments), then impl.HasFormalArgs will always be true.

 

Thanks,

A call to Write should not change the state of the template. Assuming that
the properties and getters of arguments you pass to the templates do not
have side effects (outside of the ST4 library), you should be able to call
Write as many times as you want with identical results each time.

It appears to me (from trial and error) that one can only call Write on a
Template instance once and must get a new instance before calling again. Is
this correct? On the second call ,after a successful first call, my error
listener receives errors about not being able to find variables.

Thanks
Jim

howdy. Well, ANTLR is now moving over to github. The transition will take a little bit of time because there are a few contributors still working with p4. hopefully we will be turning off p4 this week. My thoughts on how we will work going forward:

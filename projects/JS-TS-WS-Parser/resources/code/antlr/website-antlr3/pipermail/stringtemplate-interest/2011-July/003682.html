<PRE>If you derive a new STGroup implementation (say MySTGroup), you'll need to
take special precautions if you use the &quot;import&quot; statement in any of your
group files. If you also want the automatically imported groups to be
instances of MySTGroup, you'll need to copy the implementation of
STGroup.importTemplates(Token) and modify it to create instances of
MySTGroup instead of STGroup, STGroupFile, and STGroupDir. Unfortunately
there's no cleaner way of changing this functionality aside from just
avoiding import statements. You can still use the function
STGroup.importTemplates(STGroup) in code because it doesn't create any new
groups.

Regarding the wildcards: you'd be restricted to passing wildcards to
STGroup.getInstanceOf because STLexer doesn't support the asterisk as part
of a template name (as part of an expression in a template). Due to this
restriction, you don't need to override getEmbeddedInstanceOf. To allow
wildcards as part of a name within the template code, you'd need to
reimplement STLexer.java, Group.g, and STLexerNoNewlines, plus derive
classes from STCompiler to override the compile(string, string, List,
string, Token) method, CompiledST to override
defineArgumentDefaultValueTemplates(...), STGroup to override compile(...),
and the list goes on (anything that constructs CompiledST). It'd be easier
to just make a custom build of the ST4 library.

If you have the templates specified individually (as opposed to a single
string with the entire group), then STGroupDir is closest. You'll want to
create your own versions of the functions load(String) and
loadTemplateFile(String, String) that use a different method of &quot;file name
resolution&quot; and &quot;reading from disk&quot;.

If a wildcard resolves to more than one template, then I'd expect
getInstanceOf to either return List&lt;ST&gt; or throw an exception.

Would really appreciate some guidance on at least the simple, direct
questions asked in this previous email... I'd've thought they'd be quite
simple for people familiar with the internals. I've trimmed out everything
but the questions, most of which are pretty direct.

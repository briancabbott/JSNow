<PRE>  I was sleeping when I posted this yesterday, now that I'm awake I 
noticed what I did... I was actually talking about ANTLR, not 
StringTemplate, and got the mailing lists confused. =) But I guess the 
question and the version matches for both projects .

Although both projects are open source, it is hard to follow the 
development and help due to lack of access to the trunk sources, we need 
to wait until people with access zip it and post to a mailing list. I 
have never worked with perforce... I know the client is available 
freely, but I don't see any instruction on how to connect to the server. 
The access through the browser repository is hardly adequate to follow 
the development, and the link to CBS is broken for a long time.

I know the developers prefer perforce for some reason (although there 
are services today that provide really good tools, like github or 
assembla), but couldn't we have a git or subversion repository in sync 
to allow the users to follow the development? This would help us with 
the testing and probably make things more dynamic for developers as well.

Thanks,
Natan Vivo

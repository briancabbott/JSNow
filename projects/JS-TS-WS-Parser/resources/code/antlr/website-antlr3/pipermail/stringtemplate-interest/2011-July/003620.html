</I>
forError handling so I can give you a good message if there's a problem.

&gt;<i> This could then be used other than on specific 
</I>&gt;<i> occaisions, although thread synchronisation would be harder in that case 
</I>&gt;<i> - hoping to use the almost-automatic locking mechanics of Java EE in the 
</I>&gt;<i> end.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm expecting that imcluded groups will work on whatever basis they 
</I>&gt;<i> themselves use, so a flat-file group could be included for utility purposes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm also intending that, if multiple modules define identically-named 
</I>&gt;<i> templates, I'll be able to just make it predictably use either the first 
</I>&gt;<i> one defined or the last one defined (not sure which yet). I may make it 
</I>&gt;<i> so that the templates provided by modules are actually done in the form 
</I>&gt;<i> of groups that can then be included, so ones that are added to the 
</I>&gt;<i> 'core' group will always take precedence, and then have some other rule 
</I>&gt;<i> for a name being re-used in the core group.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, apart from being insane, does anyone have thoughts? Is what I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> describing (or any particular variant of it) possible? What methods need 
</I>&gt;<i> to be implemented or overriden in STGroup to do the sort of thing I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> describing?
</I>
You should subclass STGroup can override load(). Once you get a template string from wherever, such as a database, then you can call rawDefineTemplate()

 because you override load(), it will never get to methods like loadTemplateFile().

&gt;<i> Is it sensible to reuse the directory-hierarchy symbol ('/') 
</I>&gt;<i> for my hierarchy, or would it be better to use some other symbol 
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrarily? For the purposes of referring inside a template, what 
</I>&gt;<i> characters are valid for template names? Is there any reason (when 
</I>&gt;<i> adding a template to a group) to restrict the lookup name for the 
</I>&gt;<i> template itself to the same characters? My glance at the grammars 
</I>&gt;<i> suggests that IDs have to be the tradition mix of letters and 
</I>&gt;<i> underscores, and that would (I assume) apply to references within a 
</I>&gt;<i> template to another template (except '/' is obviously allowed, binding 
</I>&gt;<i> several of those together), but if the name is being provided 
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically in code (rather than read from a file), would it be 
</I>&gt;<i> restricted similarly? If it's all as restricted as it could possibly be, 
</I>&gt;<i> there's still ways around it, but I thought I'd check, as it'd be better 
</I>&gt;<i> to have (for instance) the wildcard being some character, rather than 
</I>&gt;<i> the absence of any character between separators.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally: no, really, is this insane?
</I>
Possibly, but I'm not sure. ;) I really don't understand the problem you're trying to solve.

Ack.

Nice concept/ writeup. Thanks for sharing.


&gt;<i> I believe the following conditionals would help in that regard.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    -  if:  False unless the attribute exists.

</I>&gt;<i>    -  if.null:  False unless the attribute exists, and its value is NULL.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    -  if.empty:  False unless the attribute exists, and its value is &quot;&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    -  if.true (for true/false):  False unless the attribute exists,
</I>&gt;<i> and its value is boolean TRUE (for the host language).
</I>
I'll Ack something along these lines.

&gt;<i> - if.whitespace: False unless the attribute exists, and its value is &quot;\w*&quot;.
</I>
We're better off separating &quot;trim&quot; as a function or option, I feel.


&gt;<i> NB: &quot;if.true&quot; (boolean) is defined relative to the host language (not to
</I>&gt;<i> ST), which can vary in meaning w/r/t whether &quot;&quot; is false or not in the host
</I>&gt;<i> language. So the host language (I would say) should be the determining
</I>&gt;<i> factor of the &quot;native&quot; semantics for boolean in ST for ease of use with each
</I>&gt;<i> and every host language. In other words, ST adopts the host language T/F
</I>&gt;<i> semantics for native least astonishment, and ease of use.
</I>
That's good for the newcomer, but not so good for the system and library
builders.

Java's awt lib illustrates my point, where 'pixel perfect' layouts
(views) could not be consistently achieved, because the 'platform
specifics' (eg ST host language specifics) were different on different
platforms (languages).

An entire new library (swing) was developed. Not only that, but IBM went
and created eclipse foundation, and they created ANOTHER entire new gui
library (swt). In this case, because awt was inconsistent and
inflexible, and swing was not up to speed, nor free software, at the
time.

So, I have to -1 this one, and strongly suggest that consistency of view
generation, according to a consistent-with-itself and defined-in-a-spec
manner, is essential to some larger projects, which ST should not
ignore.

(YAML has gone through some similar phases, concluding with 'generous
acceptance' principle (not their words) re UTF8/UTF16/Unicode, _and_
clearly defining clear boundaries, syntax and bahaviour, so that
inter-language serialization compatibility is maximized.


&gt;<i> Penny 3. (calling out the &quot;.&quot; syntax issue separately)
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that the &quot;.&quot; syntax could provide a customization hook for
</I>&gt;<i> language/application specific idiosyncracies. Of course, such customizations
</I>&gt;<i> would be frowned upon (for the risk of violating model/view separation of
</I>&gt;<i> concerns) but would leave the door open to unforeseeable idiosyncracies in
</I>&gt;<i> legacy et al. systems. Certain applications could use the dot syntax
</I>&gt;<i> flexibility to add variant conditional(s) to eliminate simple problems for
</I>&gt;<i> input streams for specific domains, and perhaps lead to no-brainer adoption
</I>&gt;<i> where purity would otherwise interfere, without compromising the soundness
</I>&gt;<i> of the ST model (since such customization should be few and far between and
</I>&gt;<i> very specific to quirky use cases). The &quot;.&quot; hook could allow some projects
</I>&gt;<i> to adopt ST where they normally could not due to its otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> uncompromising purity.
</I>
Good points, and I really get your drive to have ST be widely accepted/
usable etc. I do support this principle unreservedly :)

Regarding per-host-language &quot;customizations&quot; however, unless presented
with an example for which we cannot resolve or otherwise handle
'comfortably' and 'easily' using 'strictly-standard' ST semantics/
syntax, then let's stick to the high ground as long as possible.

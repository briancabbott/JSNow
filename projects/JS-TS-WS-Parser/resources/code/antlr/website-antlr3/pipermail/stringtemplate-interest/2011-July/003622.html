Definitely a good idea. The &quot;filter&quot; idea suggested in some later mail I like even better. 

Regarding the &quot;escaping system&quot;: coming up something flexible and still simple may not be easy.

</I>&gt;<i> this as potentially justified is the fact that much more wants to be 
</I>&gt;<i> done to Strings than to other types.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think we should stick to something super simple. I don't like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> String having two renderers in system at once. BUT, we currently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allow you to set renderers PER group so what does that mean?  For
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-imported groups, it's obvious.  For imports, any renderer set on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> import group is ignored even when using import template.  I guess I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ok with that. Set the renderer on the main group you use (or all to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be sure).  I look at import groups as &quot;helpers&quot; that should give me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> templates and nothing else.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The question is two-part, to me: what should be in group files (as 
</I>&gt;<i> opposed to the in-system programming representation) and what should be 
</I>&gt;<i> inherited or polymorphic between groups and groups they include. What I 
</I>&gt;<i> would see as important is that, if different groups can have different 
</I>&gt;<i> renderers and adapters set, it should look at included ones 'first' (or 
</I>&gt;<i> only) simply because of the use in modularity. This isn't inheritance in 
</I>&gt;<i> the sense it's used in programming, after all. So, for example, you 
</I>&gt;<i> could have a group that has an adapter set for SomeClassA, and if that 
</I>&gt;<i> group is included then its templates should use SomeClassA; if the 
</I>&gt;<i> programmer wants to override that, they can override it in the included 
</I>&gt;<i> group as easily as they can in the including one, surely. If the 
</I>&gt;<i> including one also has an adapter set for SomeClassA, it should use it 
</I>&gt;<i> only in its own templates, allowing modularity to be maintained. The 
</I>&gt;<i> question then becomes &quot;what if TemplateA is defined in both?&quot;. This is a 
</I>&gt;<i> peril that the programmer must consider when using group inclusion for 
</I>&gt;<i> modularity purposes, of course, as such an override might not be what is 
</I>&gt;<i> intended, but that's the programmer's lookout. In any case, what would 
</I>&gt;<i> happen with the current architecture (AIUI) would seem to be logical 
</I>&gt;<i> (though cases can be made for others) - if you override it, that group 
</I>&gt;<i> has to know how to adapt or render the class itself. So that's a good 
</I>&gt;<i> case, to me, for doing things as Udo suggests.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, I can't help feeling that renderers and adapters are 
</I>&gt;<i> part of the 'system', or Interpreter, rather than being part of the 
</I>&gt;<i> group. You might say I'm in two minds. Perhaps it's worth letting 
</I>&gt;<i> programmers do both. Use the Interpreter object to set 'default' 
</I>&gt;<i> renderers and adapters, to be used if the defining group doesn't have 
</I>&gt;<i> one set; when trying to find the renderer or adapter, first check the 
</I>&gt;<i> defining group for the template, and if it doesn't have one set, check 
</I>&gt;<i> the interpreter. This allows the programmer to set Interpreter-wide ones 
</I>&gt;<i> where appropriate, to save registering the same one everywhere if you 
</I>&gt;<i> have lots of groups, yet it also allows it to be set per-group to get 
</I>&gt;<i> the behaviour you want. In the event you want a default used (even where 
</I>&gt;<i> the default doesn't exist) on a particular group, but have one set in 
</I>&gt;<i> the Interpreter, allow groups to store an entry of null - if the group 
</I>&gt;<i> has a null adapter/renderer, then don't bother to look at the 
</I>&gt;<i> Interpreter, just look directly at defaults.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the subject of the Interpreter, does it currently support there being 
</I>&gt;<i> multiple Interpreters in a single VM? I'd say it should, as there are 
</I>&gt;<i> conceivable instances that would lead to it being architecturally 
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate, and matches the way most standard APIs work with such 
</I>&gt;<i> things IME.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, just my thoughts.

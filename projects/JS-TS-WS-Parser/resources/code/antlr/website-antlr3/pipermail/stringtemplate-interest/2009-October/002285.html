native.* seems clear enough.

That could be suitable. I'd still like to see an actual use-case-
with-code that requires this though.

...
&gt;<i> Purity prohibits even one operator of native compatibility.  That
</I>
If we added native.if, are there other operators you see
being useful in the native.* library?


&gt;<i> &gt; Need a concrete example of a problem it solves. Hasn't been an issue on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the lists before know, and this discussion so far we've had the luxury
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of living in hypothetical land.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm confused.  This whole topic started with the discussion of
</I>&gt;<i> splitting &quot;if&quot; into &quot;if&quot; variants.  That's a real world issue from
</I>&gt;<i> this list.
</I>
Modifying ST into 'platform specific' variants is a significant
change if it were undertaken.

An actual example would be useful to the discussion.

I'm thinking that an actual example, which clearly identifies
the problem from a specific language (eg python, C#, whatever)
might be easy to counter with existing simple ST techniques.

If native.if were the only elegant solution, then that would be
useful information to the discussion ...


&gt;<i> &gt; Again, there are more areas in st, where host-env specific stuff could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be applied. No point adding just one without also addressing the others.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Umm, I'm assuming this is the proverbial can of worms you are afraid
</I>&gt;<i> of?  Is that where all this confusion is coming from?  FYI, I am just
</I>&gt;<i> talking about this one feature (or some well-constrained variant), and
</I>&gt;<i> I think this feature has merit on its own.  (Let the other issues
</I>&gt;<i> stand on their own merits.)
</I>
It may have merit enough to stand on its own.

A native.* library would be good to think/ plan for in advance
though, rather than one feature at a time, don't you think?

Good discussion

glad it is food for thought.

&gt;<i> 1. Does StringTemplate preclude using all Ajax and javascript since

</I>
Well, ST can't control what you put in the template so you can use  
JavaScript with no problem.  The problem of course is that pull data  
from the server which starts to break model view separation.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> perhaps it is a simple Mouse-over effect.
</I>
  it's not just simple things like avoiding modifying the model. You  
want to avoid embedding logic. embedding mouse over stuff is okay  
though.

These are good questions...i hope it's okay if I send to the interest  
list also.

&gt;<i> 2. If Ajax and/or JS can still be used, what is the workflow? In  
</I>&gt;<i> other words, can I use StringTemplate to &quot;inject&quot; the Ajax/JS code,  
</I>&gt;<i> or is there a more advisable way?
</I>
well, I think you just included like regular HTML.

&gt;<i> I couldn't find any articles or docs on how to incorporate ajax with  
</I>&gt;<i> StringTemplate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Could Groovy's &quot;builder&quot; mechanism be used fairly easily to do  
</I>&gt;<i> the same sort of thing as StringTemplate?  Not that I'm trying to  
</I>&gt;<i> underestimate the power or amount of
</I>&gt;<i> effort involved in StringTemplate.  It's sometimes just edifying to  
</I>&gt;<i> contrast two different approaches - then I begin to understand how  
</I>&gt;<i> it works.
</I>
remind me what the builder does?

&gt;<i> I'm kinda new to the web development world.  I want to build my own  
</I>&gt;<i> Loosely Coupled framework of &quot;components&quot; that are as simple as  
</I>&gt;<i> possible.  I want strict

</I>&gt;<i> build dynamic websites generatively (for the most part).  I want to  
</I>&gt;<i> automate as much as possible,
</I>&gt;<i> and this is the way I see that happing (not heavyweight inflexible  
</I>&gt;<i> frameworks like Rails).  Any suggestions/links/articles along these  
</I>&gt;<i> lines would be appreciated -
</I>&gt;<i> specifically with regard other web framework components that work  
</I>&gt;<i> well with StringTemplate (or perhaps those that I should shy away  
</I>&gt;<i> from.)
</I>
A number of people have written webpages about incorporating it into  
other systems. I think the C# guys have incorporated it into cocoon  
etc..

&gt;<i> Great work.  I always appreciate academic people who can write  
</I>&gt;<i> intelligent, useful, readable papers that get their ideas across to  
</I>&gt;<i> us lowly people. Then when they actually
</I>&gt;<i> produce products that people use and love, as you have ... that's  
</I>&gt;<i> pretty uncommon.
</I>
Thanks :)  Glad to help.

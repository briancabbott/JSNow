That is weird...So when you create base and the subgroups and set the  
refresh interval to 0 before doing any loading, it still has a problem?

&gt;<i> Second is a feature I am probably not using the way that was expected.
</I>&gt;<i> Basically my system is a web framework, it handles multiple contexts
</I>&gt;<i> and each context has it's own templates.  To try get around naming
</I>&gt;<i> conflicts what I did was cache a group loader for each context.  Then
</I>&gt;<i> when my string template controller is asked to render it registers the
</I>&gt;<i> group loader for that context with
</I>&gt;<i> StringTemplateGroup.registerGroupLoader().  Then it calls load group
</I>&gt;<i> with the correct template.  The problem here is if you have two
</I>&gt;<i> contexts that both have a base.stg for example.  Once you goto the
</I>&gt;<i> first context and render is called everything works fine, you get the
</I>&gt;<i> templates for that context.  Then you goto another context that has a
</I>&gt;<i> base.stg, the correct group loader is registered and the group is
</I>&gt;<i> loaded from it.  The problem there is you get the base.stg from the
</I>&gt;<i> first context even though you are on a different group loader, but if
</I>&gt;<i> the other templates don't clash by name you get the correct other
</I>&gt;<i> parts.  I am guessing that this is an artifact of the caching problem
</I>&gt;<i> above.  Base has been cached regardless of the registered group
</I>&gt;<i> loader.  So even though I have changed the group loader the call for
</I>&gt;<i> base.stg is returning the cached version.
</I>&gt;<i> Has it ever been considered that you might need a way to load multiple
</I>&gt;<i> distinct sets of templates (that may contain naming conflicts), or is
</I>&gt;<i> there another way to work around it?
</I>
ST was specifically designed to handle this. that is the point of the  
group mechanism. jGuru did this all the time. A new skin for the site  
was simply a new ST group. From the session, I find the skin name and  
then switch the templateLib pointer in my framework to the appropriate  
ST gropu object. works like a charm including inheritance.

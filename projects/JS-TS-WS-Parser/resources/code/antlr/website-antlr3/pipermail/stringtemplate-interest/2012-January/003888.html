I'm using Git for over 2 years now since I switched from SVN. I don't really 
know what there is &quot;baroque&quot; or &quot;whacked definitions&quot;, do you care do explain 
a little bit more?

Rewriting history is a good thing, as long as it's not published. For example, 
you can amend commits, if you forgot something, you can re-order commits to 
make your changes more understandable for others, etc. As long as your commits 
are not published to others, who cares if you rewrite your history.

Yes; I think a filtering system gives complete flexibility without any 
complexity in the templates themselves, just a requirement to supply 
filters for the keys used. I'm glad it makes sense to someone other than 
just me :)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extensibility for the core String renderer - you know, put in a method
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that does nothing but can be inherited, make the first thing the render
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> method does be defer to that method, if it returns a String emit it, if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it returns null carry on with default activity. This allows people to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extend it without losing the default behaviour. Even more flexible would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be a way of handling many such delegate methods. The only reason I see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this as potentially justified is the fact that much more wants to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> done to Strings than to other types.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think we should stick to something super simple. I don't like
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> String having two renderers in system at once. BUT, we currently
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> allow you to set renderers PER group so what does that mean?  For
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> non-imported groups, it's obvious.  For imports, any renderer set on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> import group is ignored even when using import template.  I guess I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ok with that. Set the renderer on the main group you use (or all to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be sure).  I look at import groups as &quot;helpers&quot; that should give me
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> templates and nothing else.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The question is two-part, to me: what should be in group files (as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opposed to the in-system programming representation) and what should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inherited or polymorphic between groups and groups they include. What I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would see as important is that, if different groups can have different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> renderers and adapters set, it should look at included ones 'first' (or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only) simply because of the use in modularity. This isn't inheritance in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the sense it's used in programming, after all. So, for example, you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could have a group that has an adapter set for SomeClassA, and if that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> group is included then its templates should use SomeClassA; if the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> programmer wants to override that, they can override it in the included
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> group as easily as they can in the including one, surely. If the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> including one also has an adapter set for SomeClassA, it should use it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only in its own templates, allowing modularity to be maintained. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> question then becomes &quot;what if TemplateA is defined in both?&quot;. This is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> peril that the programmer must consider when using group inclusion for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modularity purposes, of course, as such an override might not be what is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intended, but that's the programmer's lookout. In any case, what would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happen with the current architecture (AIUI) would seem to be logical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (though cases can be made for others) - if you override it, that group
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has to know how to adapt or render the class itself. So that's a good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case, to me, for doing things as Udo suggests.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the other hand, I can't help feeling that renderers and adapters are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> part of the 'system', or Interpreter, rather than being part of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> group. You might say I'm in two minds. Perhaps it's worth letting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> programmers do both. Use the Interpreter object to set 'default'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> renderers and adapters, to be used if the defining group doesn't have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one set; when trying to find the renderer or adapter, first check the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> defining group for the template, and if it doesn't have one set, check
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the interpreter. This allows the programmer to set Interpreter-wide ones
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where appropriate, to save registering the same one everywhere if you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have lots of groups, yet it also allows it to be set per-group to get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the behaviour you want. In the event you want a default used (even where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the default doesn't exist) on a particular group, but have one set in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Interpreter, allow groups to store an entry of null - if the group
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has a null adapter/renderer, then don't bother to look at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Interpreter, just look directly at defaults.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the subject of the Interpreter, does it currently support there being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multiple Interpreters in a single VM? I'd say it should, as there are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conceivable instances that would lead to it being architecturally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appropriate, and matches the way most standard APIs work with such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things IME.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, just my thoughts.

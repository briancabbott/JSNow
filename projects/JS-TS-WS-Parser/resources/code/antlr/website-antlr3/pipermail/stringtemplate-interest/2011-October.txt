Subject: [stringtemplate-interest] Problems migrating v3 template group
	inheritance to v4
Message-ID: <CA+iZJ0_ksFPfG+U1f+PCcxjnBmM5ErwLvXTnmB3K0gy4DQXG8g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I'm updating my project to v4. The goal is to minimize the changes in
template structure, but I got stuck with inheritance. Any help would be
appreciated. Thanks!

So the setup with inheritance:

CContainerDef.stg (in v3: group CContainerDef : CModuleDef)
CEnumerationParamDef.stg (in v3: group CEnumerationParamDef : CContainerDef)
CModuleDef.stg
...

It's running inside an Eclipse bundle, so I created a STGroup subclass. Same
as STGroupDir, just using bundle URLs. I updated the templates with "import"

CContainerDef.stg

import "CModuleDef.stg"

Templates from 'CContainerDef'  are loaded as '/CContainerDef/<template>, I
guess it's parent<>template relationship. I have a template 'container' in
'CModuleDef', so after import it should be available in 'CContainerDef'. ST
sees it's not available and tries to load it as '/CContainerDef/container'.
Ends up loading itself again?? This is done without looking at the imported
stg. Maybe I am completely misunderstanding the template group concept.

Hi - my apologies if this has been handled elsewhere previously...
I'm currently using the C# port of ST4. In a group that imports another group,
I can refer to a template from the imported group, but not to a dictionary. E.g:

//group1.stg
delimiters "$", "$"

template1() ::= "template 1 - $messages.message1$"

messages ::= [
"message1"        : "message 1",
"message2"        : "message 2"
]
//end of group1.stg

//group2.stg
delimiters "$", "$"
import "group1.stg"

template2() ::= "template 2 - $template1()$ $messages.message2$"
//end of group2.stg

The output of template2() is "template 2 - template 1 - message 1",
And the error thrown is "attribute group1 isn't defined".
Is there some obvious syntax I'm missing - why can't template2
See the 'messages' dictionary?

Re - sorry there was an error in my previous question, the actual error thrown is "attribute messages isn't defined".
Thanks

Hi. Are you saying that you want to import template container and reference it from the subgroup template container? If so, I think something like super.container() is needed.

hi. I think that we intended for dictionaries to be inherited. For example, here's a unit test at least in the Java version:

	@Test public void testImportDictionary() throws Exception {
		String Root =
			"d ::= [\"a\":\"b\"]\n";

		String Sub =
			"t() ::= <<\n" +
			"<d.a>\n" +
			">>\n";
		STGroup r = new STGroupString(Root);
		STGroup s = new STGroupString(Sub);
		s.importTemplates(r);
		ST st = s.getInstanceOf("t"); // visible only if we can see inherited dicts
		String expected = "b";
		String result = st.render();
		assertEquals(expected, result);
	}

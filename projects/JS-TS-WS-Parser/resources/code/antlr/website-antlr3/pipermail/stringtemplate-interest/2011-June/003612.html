&gt;&gt;<i> ... I don't like String having two renderers in system at once. BUT, we currently allow you to set renderers PER group so what does that mean?  For non-imported groups, it's obvious.  For imports, any renderer set on import group is ignored even when using import template.  I guess I'm ok with that. Set the renderer on the main group you use (or all to be sure).  I look at import groups as &quot;helpers&quot; that should give me templates and nothing else.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a very nice summary of your objectives and your intentions. However ST4 as it is today does not really reflect this. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the main problem is associating renderers/adaptors with STGroups. From what you write I think you are thinking of renderers/adapters more of &quot;language extensions&quot; (or &quot;system extensions&quot;) rather than &quot;Group extensions&quot;. This would be better reflected by moving the whole renderer/adapter stuff to the &quot;Interpreter&quot; (something already suggested in this thread). This way it is obvious there will be no &quot;two renderers for String in the system&quot;.
</I>
ah! you are so right! it was a leftover from v3 that had no interp really.

&gt;<i> Attaching the renderers/adaptors to the interpreter would also get rid of the question what &quot;renderers of imported templates&quot; mean (as there aren't any). This would also mean one would not need to set the &quot;renderers of the main groups&quot; but just to the interpreter, also avoiding this &quot;in-symmetry&quot; regarding groups. (BTW: This change will break existing code, as STGroup no longer provides the &quot;register&#8230;&quot; method. Also the Interpreter would become more prominent in this solution etc.).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand I personally would prefer to stick to the &quot;per group&quot; registration of renderers/adapters and add the &quot;look first in native group&quot; feature. This would mean there could be more than one renderer per class (e.g. for String). However I don't have a problem with this as long it is clear what renderer is used. The main reason why I support this is probably the way I look at groups. Rather than looking at imported groups as &quot;helpers&quot; groups are for me the units of modularization in ST4. I create groups that serve a certain purpose and can be used &quot;on their own&quot;. I later want to use them in other groups, simply be importing them and calling their templates. I would not like to do more (like merging various String renderer implementations) as this makes the reuse harder and more error-prone. (BTW: this change is compatible with existing code, just adds some more options)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I see two options regarding renderers/adapters of imported groups here:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) move the renderer/adapter stuff from STGroup to Interpreter, or
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Implement the &quot;look first in native group&quot; for renderers/adapters (my favorite)
</I>
how about ONLY look in native group?  That is even more clear I think and was sort of my original thought/expectation on this.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Udo: can you live with making one uber-string-renderer?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually no, as this does not really solves the problem I tried to point out. The example I brought up was just an example to illustrate the situation. Of cause one could come up with solutions that work around the issue, but this was not really my point. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My main point was asking to support renderers in imported groups (without changing the root groups). This is not directly related to String renderers. E.g. if I have a general purpose group &quot;XMLUtil&quot; dealing with XML I want to add a renderer(/adapter) for &quot;org.w3c.dom.Node&quot; to the &quot;XMLUtil&quot; group. The &quot;root groups&quot; don't need to know about this. I may even have different groups using different adapters/renderers of &quot;Node&quot;. This leads to a better system structure, with all these things like &quot;information hiding&quot;, &quot;separation of concern&quot;, &quot;modularization&quot;, &quot;encapsulation&quot;, &#8230;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ----------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One of the Sams suggested a single renderer for strings that knows more escapes. I think that is a fine solution since we are really saying we need to render strings in both cases. Why not group together:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;s; format=&quot;javadoc-escape&quot;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When you talk about &quot;group together&quot; do you mean the stuff discussed in &quot;[stringtemplate-interest] [ST4] How to apply multiple &quot;format&quot;s to an expression?&quot; <A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/stringtemplate-interest/2011-February/003216.html">http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/stringtemplate-interest/2011-February/003216.html</A> ?
</I>
Just meant building combining code from two renderers into one.

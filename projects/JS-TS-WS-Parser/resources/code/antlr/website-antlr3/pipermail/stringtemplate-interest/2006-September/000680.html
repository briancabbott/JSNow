<PRE>I was thinking about how templates can be called recursively. Just for fun I
decided to try the classic recursive definition of reverse.
    group Reverse;
    reverse(L) ::= &lt;&lt;
    $if(L)$
    $reverse(rest(L))$$first(L)$
    $endif$
    &gt;&gt;

&gt;<i>From another template I called $reverse(list)$ where list is an attribute
</I>created as:
    String myList[] = { &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot; };
    st.setAttribute(&quot;list&quot;, myList);

The expected result is &#147;edcba&#148;. It is probably not a good idea for a
template to have this kind of logic in it but I wanted to play with
recursion.

This didn&#146;t work. All it printed was &#147;a&#148;. I tried adding &#147;test $L$,
$first(L)$, $rest(L)$&#148; as the first line of reverse to try to debug. I found
that after the first call first and rest were not working &#150; they returned
nothing. I set a breakpoint in ASTExpr.rest. The rest method will return an
iterator over the collection (I&#146;m using the term collection generally here)
positioned at the second element. It is this iterator and not a collection
that is passed to the template. Now rest is called with the input L being an
iterator. The trouble is that this iterator is already at the end by the
time rest is called again. I&#146;m not exactly sure why that happened but it may
be that the $if(L)$ must evaluate L by iterating. When I added the debugging
that would definitely cause the iterator to stick at the end. The trouble
with an iterator being passed to a template rather than a collection is that
once it is used it can&#146;t be used again! Even $first(L)$ when L is an
iterator will cause problems because it leaves the iterator one position
farther along.

I changed rest to return a new collection (ArrayList) that contains the rest
of the original collection. After making this change the reverse template
worked perfectly.

The trouble is that creating a new collection is wasteful. Perhaps there is
a way to determine if a copy of rest is needed rather than just an iterator.
For example just at the point where the iterator is going to be passed to a
template it is copied to a new collection. Are there any other cases where
an iterator should be turned to a collection?

If Java iterators supported cloning (clone would create a new iterator over
the same colection positioned at the point where the original iterator was
cloned) it may be enough to always return a cloned iterator from rest. But
Java iterators don&#146;t allow cloning.

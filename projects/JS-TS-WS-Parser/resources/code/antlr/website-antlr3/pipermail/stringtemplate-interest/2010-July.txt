  Sam,

Since you were talking about that, I was wondering, how is the 
development of the 3.2 C# port going? Is it still active?

I think that if you made the snapshots available in the main download 
page (like the C port has), probably more people would be testing.

I remember I tried to use it when you posted, but it was too unstable 
and wouldn't even create compilable code, and since I was working on 
something I had to put in production, I decided to just go back to the 
previous version and get the work done...

I plan to get back to develop some tools with antlr, and would be nice 
to try it again if a new version is available.

Thanks.

I've been using the latest version Sam posted and have found it to be much
more stable than the 3.1 version.

I do agree that it needs to be more accessible though.  I did find some bugs
under Mono that I never have had time to resolve...

  I was sleeping when I posted this yesterday, now that I'm awake I 
noticed what I did... I was actually talking about ANTLR, not 
StringTemplate, and got the mailing lists confused. =) But I guess the 
question and the version matches for both projects .

Although both projects are open source, it is hard to follow the 
development and help due to lack of access to the trunk sources, we need 
to wait until people with access zip it and post to a mailing list. I 
have never worked with perforce... I know the client is available 
freely, but I don't see any instruction on how to connect to the server. 
The access through the browser repository is hardly adequate to follow 
the development, and the link to CBS is broken for a long time.

I know the developers prefer perforce for some reason (although there 
are services today that provide really good tools, like github or 
assembla), but couldn't we have a git or subversion repository in sync 
to allow the users to follow the development? This would help us with 
the testing and probably make things more dynamic for developers as well.

Thanks,
Natan Vivo

Subject: [stringtemplate-interest] C# indexer - no attribute in template
	context
Message-ID: <4C49C286.60302@ourscale.eu>

Hi!

I'm new to StringTemplate, and I've been trying to use it with an CLR
indexer.

I've boiled down my troubles to this simple program:

using System;
using Antlr3.ST;

public class Lang {
  public string this [ string key ] {
    set {}
    get {return "Foo"; }
  }
}

public class HelloWorld {
  static public void Main (){
    Console.WriteLine("Hi");

    Lang l = new Lang();
    Console.WriteLine(l["XX"]);

    StringTemplate hello = new StringTemplate("Hello, $name$: $lang.XX$");
    hello.SetAttribute("name", "World");
    hello.SetAttribute("lang", l);
    Console.WriteLine(hello.ToString());
  }
}

If I'm reading the documentation located here correctly,
http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ST/Expressions

this should just output:

Hi
XX
Hello World: XX


Unfortunately, I'm getting:
Hi
Foo
Class Lang has no such attribute: XX in template context [anonymous]
Hello, World:

Do you have a suggestion? Google reveals nothing relevant.

Cheers,
Tomasz

I think you have to implement IDictionary with the C#  version to get it to
use the indexer...

For my projects, I have a dictionary base that just satisfies the
IDictionary requirements...  So you just inherit from the base and then
override the indexer.

IIRC, ST calls the Contains method first to verify that the value exists,
then uses the indexer.

    public abstract class DictionaryBase : IDictionary    {
#region IDictionary
        public virtual void Add(object key, object value)        {
       throw new NotImplementedException();        }
        public virtual void Clear()        {            throw new
NotImplementedException();        }
        public virtual bool Contains(object key)        {
return true;        }
        public virtual IDictionaryEnumerator GetEnumerator()        {
          throw new NotImplementedException();        }
        public virtual bool IsFixedSize        {            get {
throw new NotImplementedException(); }        }
        public virtual bool IsReadOnly        {            get {
return true; }        }
        public virtual ICollection Keys        {            get {
throw new NotImplementedException(); }        }
        public virtual void Remove(object key)        {
throw new NotImplementedException();        }
        public virtual ICollection Values        {            get {
return new object[0]; }        }
        public abstract object this[object key]        {
get;            set;        }
        public virtual void CopyTo(Array array, int index)        {
        throw new NotImplementedException();        }
        public virtual int Count        {            get { return 1; }        }
        public virtual bool IsSynchronized        {            get {
throw new NotImplementedException(); }        }
        public virtual object SyncRoot        {            get { throw
new NotImplementedException(); }        }
        IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()        {
throw new NotImplementedException();        }
        #endregion    }

I may be wrong about this... using ST 3.2 C# port here.

Hope this helps,
Dustin

Subject: [stringtemplate-interest] ST4 - Newlines in parameter default
	values are not respected
Message-ID: <D07D28D1-CBF6-4F2E-88D3-C29AC740B344@abego-software.de>

I am working StringTemplate v4, snapshot 2010-05-10.

It looks like newlines in string literals used as default values for template parameters are not expanded.

A full test case can be found here: http://pastebin.com/t6TDY4qf


Example ===============

Consider this group definition:
---
t2(p1) ::= <<
<p1>
>>

t1() ::= <<
START-<t2(p1="Some\nText")>-END
>>
---

Here t1 (correctly) renders to
---
START-Some
Text-END
---

Now make the actual value for parameter p1 a default parameter value, i.e. 
---
t2(p1="Some\nText") ::= <<
<p1>
>>

t1() ::= <<
START-<t2()>-END
>>
---

Unexpectedly this renders t1 to
---
START
Some\nText
END
---
===============

Udo

P.S.: 
Is there a way to access the version control system directly to always get the latest and greatest, or just the snapshots from http://www.stringtemplate.org/download/trunk ?

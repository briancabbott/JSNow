Interesting...i was thinking of adding name iterator variables like:

$names:{ n | &lt;b&gt;$n$&lt;/b&gt;}$

[syntax taken from smalltalk]

Further I was thinking of adding parallel list walking, which would  
require names to avoid indexing:

$first,last:{ x, y | Name: $x$ $y$}$

perhaps a similar notation for maps:

$map:{key, value | &lt;td&gt;$key$&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$value$&lt;/td&gt;}$

or some such.  If it's a map and has two variable names, then it must  
mean key/value pair.

</I>&gt;<i> 3.0. (In
</I>&gt;<i> other words, it's not an immediate problem for me).
</I>
Got it.

&gt;&gt;<i> Well, that said, I still
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> worry about making people have so much type info that it's a map  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not  a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> list etc...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, if its their model, they presumably /decided/ some getter should
</I>&gt;<i> return a Map rather than a List, because that was more appropriate to
</I>&gt;<i> their needs. To then treat the map like a list seems a little counter
</I>&gt;<i> productive.
</I>
I think you're right.  I didn't think through the map iteration well  
enough before I put it in. :(

&gt;<i> In any case if you can iterate over Map.Entrys, it's trivial enough to
</I>&gt;<i> iterate over that map as if it were a list of the map's keys, so you
</I>&gt;<i> lose nothing.
</I>
True.  You can pass map.keySet in as an attribute.

&gt;<i> My point is that maps and sequences are conceptually different, and  
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> a good reason; I think ST should accept that.
</I>
Yes, you're right.

&gt;<i> Keep up the good work!
</I>
Thanks!  I think you'll like 2.2.  Much improved error messages and  
lots of new features, bug fixes.

Something I read the other day cracked me up on an FreeMarker mailing  
list; it described ST as just a pet project.  I wanted to write  
back...just like ANTLR is ;)

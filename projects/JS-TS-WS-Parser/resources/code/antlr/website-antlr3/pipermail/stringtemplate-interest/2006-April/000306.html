Hi Koen!

  it seems that we all go down the same path :)

&gt;<i> The next step in the evolution was dumping our meta domain in an  
</I>&gt;<i> XML file and using XSLT to generate to code.
</I>&gt;<i> One advantage of this approach was the we also used what you call  
</I>&gt;<i> 'template application' (Lisp's Map or XLTS' push model).
</I>&gt;<i> The major drawback was that you need to know XSLT.
</I>
Yes,  which is a hideous beast ;)

&gt;<i> Because of readability and maintainability we switched to Velocity.
</I>&gt;<i> Velocity was chosen because one of our non-functional requirements  
</I>&gt;<i> was that it should be available for Java and .Net.
</I>&gt;<i> Velocity served us well until we hit the 'recursion' wall ...
</I>
Ha!   As I say in my upcoming paper &quot;A functional language for  
generating structured text&quot;:

	&quot;While providing all sorts of dangerous features like assignment
that promote the use of computations and logic in templates, many
engines miss the key elements. Certain language semantics are ab-
solutely required for generative programming and language trans-
lation. One is recursion. A template engine without recursion seems
unlikely to be capable of generating recursive output structures
such as nested tables or nested code blocks.&quot;

&gt;<i> In Velocity parameters are always allocated globally, so there is  
</I>&gt;<i> no sensible way to achieve recursion.
</I>
  yes, that does seem very odd, but I've been learning and thinking  
about languages for long time.   I don't think my fingers could type  
something that had global variables for parameters ;)

&gt;<i> There now is an unofficial workaround using #local() but it is not  
</I>&gt;<i> available on the .Net port (Nvelocity).
</I>
ick.

&gt;<i> So, I started looking for an alternative and found StringTemplate!
</I>
Hooray!

&gt;<i> We just completed the port to StringTemplate and I must say that we  
</I>&gt;<i> had to introduce some 'boolean' attributes in our domain
</I>
  yes, because all computations must be done in the model; the  
results of these copy patients are that passed into the string  
templates.

&gt;<i> but the resulting templates are far more concise and readable.
</I>
Hooray!   hi another quote from the paper regarding the program-esque  
loop-style of templating:

	&quot;The fact that StringTemplate does not allow such things as as-
signments (no side-effects) should make you suspicious of engines
that do allow it. I guarantee that the templates in ANTLR v3&#8217;s code
generator are vastly more complicated than any web page, for ex-
ample, created for use with another template engine and I have yet
to find a situation where I needed assignments. If your template
looks like a program, it probably is&#8211;you have totally entangled your
model and view.&quot;

&gt;<i> What we noticed is that the templates now look a lot like our  
</I>&gt;<i> former XSLT templates,
</I>&gt;<i> with one big difference that they're not XSLT ;-)
</I>
Yeah!

&gt;<i> If you should ever change the name of StringTemplate then I suggest  
</I>&gt;<i> ReverseParser, BackwardsParser or Resrap !
</I>&gt;<i> I think this describes it best, it is a Parser used backwards ...
</I>
Yes, it's an unparser generator.   The name is an unfortunate legacy  
of the past. I am seriously considering changing it to ST because  
that is what everyone uses for short, but that is not unique and web  
searches will not find it.

&gt;<i> The most important thing StringTemplate misses right now is some  
</I>&gt;<i> tooling, like editor support.
</I>
Agreed.  Jean Bovet,  The author of ANTLRWorks  is hoping to build  
one  in the future.

&gt;<i> Maybe I'll write an editor for Eclipse, what is actually not that  
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to do.
</I>
  Let me know if you want to talk about this project...

&gt;<i> But first we have to release Allors 1.0 ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway thanks for the tool,
</I>
You are very welcome.

Terence

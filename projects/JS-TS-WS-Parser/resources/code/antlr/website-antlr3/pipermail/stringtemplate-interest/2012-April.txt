trying to do the Python install of stringtemplate.

grabbed PyStringTemplate-3.2b1.tar.gz  which yielded  stringtemplate3-3.2b1
when I installed stringtemplate3-3.2b1 and ran a simple test, it told me I was 
missing  the antlr module. So I installed: antlr_python_runtime-3.1.3 but 
instead found it gave me antlr3.

I've been looking but I have not found a fix yet. Suggestions?

Subject: [stringtemplate-interest] How to send parameters from template
Message-ID: <4F7EE333.6010701@gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to rewrite an online store front-end written in JSP using 
StringTemplate. Everything seems to be OK but there is something that I 
don't know how to implement it ST.

Here are two examples of things I want to do:

*1. Example A*
I'm generating the image url for products and because those images are 
placed in different places I need to sent the image width/height based 
on the location where the image is shown. For example the following code 
will show the item image on a specific page:

<li id="productImages">
<div id="defaultImage">
                             $if(item.defaultImage.isAvailable)$
<a href="$item.defaultImage.url$" 
onclick="javascript:window.open('$item.defaultImage.url$','','scrollbars=no,menubar=no,height=725,width=850,resizable=no,toolbar=no,location=no,status=no'); 
event.preventDefault();" title="$item.seoTitle$">
<img src="$item.defaultImage.src$" width="$item.defaultImage.width$" 
height="$item.defaultImage.height$" alt="$item.seoTitle$" />
<img src="/images/zoom.png" class="zoom" alt="Zoom image - 
$item.seoTitle$" />
</a>
                             $else$
<!-- show empty image here -->
                             $endif$
</div>
                         $if(item.images)$
<ul class="thumbnailImages">
                             $item.images:{image|
                                 $if(!image.default)$
<li><a href="$image.url$" 
onclick="javascript:window.open('$image.url$','','scrollbars=no,menubar=no,height=725,width=850,resizable=no,toolbar=no,location=no,status=no'); 
event.preventDefault();" title="$item.seoTitle$">
<img src="$image.thumbnailSrc$" width="$image.thumbnailWidth$" 
height="$image.thumbnailHeight$" alt="$item.seoTitle$" /></a>
</li>
                                 $endif$
                             }$
</ul>
                         $endif$
</li>

Because the image is automatically resized based on width/height 
parameters sent to the image url:

     public String getSrc() {
         return response.encodeUrl(getImagePath() + "?mediaId=" + id + 
"&amp;width=" + getWidth() + "&amp;height=" + getHeight() + "&amp;name=" 
+ getTitle());
     }

What I want is to be able to sent the width/height parameters to the 
getSrc() method to leave the control of the image width/height to the 
html/web designer.

*2. Example B*
I want to be able to identify witch option from the following select 
should be selected based on a parameter that is sent to back to the page:

<span class="label">Show:</span>&nbsp;
<select name="itemsPerPage" class="modinput2" 
onchange="location='$category.itemsPerPageUrl$&amp;itemsPerPage=' + 
this.options[this.selectedIndex].value;">
<option value="10" selected="selected">10 items on page</option>
<option value="20">20 items on page</option>
<option value="30">30 items on page</option>
<option value="40">40 items on page</option>
<option value="50">50 items on page</option>
</select>
</span>

The only solution that i'm thinking of could be a function that accept a 
parameter (number of items per page) and will return true/false if that 
parameter is equal with the value of the selected option. Something like 
this:

$if(numberOfItems(20))$
<option value="20" selected="selected">20 items on page</option>
$else$
<option value="20">20 items on page</option>
$endif$

I don't want to hard-code the number of items per page in code as I want 
to leave this control to the designer through HTML files.

Any hints how I can use ST in this kind of situation?

Thank you.

Hi. Yeah,You cannot pass parameters to getters. no information from the template is allowed to go back into the model without entangling the model and the view. Looks to me like you're getSrc() has code that is creating output, which defeats the purpose of ST. The rules of strict separation suggested that no output characters can be computed in the model.

The view should not be trying to compute which one is selected for your 2nd example. That is information that should be precomputed and sent to the view.

You point is correct but in my case i can't compose the src in the 
template because the getSrc() method is actually a call to urlrewrite 
library (response.encodeUrl()) and it will transform the src string to a 
new string based on the urlrewrite configuration.

In my first example the getSrc() call for a string like 
"/media/product/?mediaId=10&width=140&height=140&name=some-seo-url" will 
return a seo enabled src string (eg. 
"/images/some-seo-url__10__140_140") that is configurable in the 
urlrewrite xml config file. This will allow the owner of the store to 
customize his SEO url's.

Can you do something with a formatter / renderer object in ST?

stringtemplate3 needs good old antlr V2.x
Download http://www.antlr2.org/download/antlr-2.7.7.tar.gz, and put
antlr.py from lib/python/antlr/ somewhere in your PYTHONPATH.

I'm not sure how to use the attribute renderer to solve my issue.
How do I inject width/height variables in the string before sending it 
for processing to the url rewrite filter using attribute renderer?

Hiya,

I've  then speaking with the awesome people at stack exchange and they were okay with me pointing the support list at

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/antlr 

rather than using the mailing list. Well, we would have to phase it out or something and keep the archives available. Part of the issue is that people use both at the moment. there is no single place to go for questions.

Basically, I'm trying to reduce my system administration load. I've turned off p4 in favor of github and have turned off jira in favor of github's bug tracker.  I tried to move the confluence wiki to the on demand service, but I'm not sure it's ready for prime time yet so I backed off.

Moving to that website has a lot of advantages over an old-school mailing list, if you've ever used it. You can also treat it like a mailing list by asking for events when someone posts an antlr-tagged posting. It's set up very nicely for question-and-answer. It's also easier for people to post a question because they don't have to sign up for our mailing list. there is a good chance that they will have an account already at stackoverflow.com

Does anybody see any bears in the woods that I'm not? issues? those in favor?

Do what you need to do. Honestaly I want you spending your free time
making ST awesomer and not admining stuff. I was unaware of the stack
overflow page so I'll go there from now on.

Sorry for spamming the whole list but I want to draw attention that it does not send out the password reminder. I tried a number of times and haven't received anything.

Yeah, worried about that too.

Well, we could move to a Google group for sure or we could try the chat at SO:

http://chat.stackoverflow.com/search?q=antlr

has anyone tried this chat thing at SO?

we would create a chat room for ANTLR / ST.

Ter,

I think that google groups has improved vastly since last we looked. I think I claimed ANTLR, or perhaps you did, but it takes virtually no maintenance and I think that one or both of us has the name or a suitable name. 

Stackoverflow isn't what we need after I have looked at it - in fact it is not what any group needs and is instead aimed at an amorphous group of everyone, for which it appears very good. We need something more focused and I think that google groups is just fine. 

Jim

I'm slowly coming around this position. just think about where we would have this very discussion. it would get closed immediately at SO as it is not a question.

I'm thinking that the Google group idea in addition to SO for FAQ-like questions is the right approach. I can alter the website to differentiate and also in the discussion group, we can point people at SO answers.

Let me poke around to see what groups Jim Idle and I created years ago that might still be around :) It satisfies one of my goals of not having to manage another piece of software.

getting: "An error (#681) occurred while communicating with the server.Reload"

when trying to create the ANTLR group

https://groups.google.com/d/forum/antlr

 No doubt it is because there used to be such a name?

BTW, I'm going to create just one list for all tools in the ANTLR project ecosystem.

yeah, that's a mirror I believe.  I've created:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/antlr-discussion

Will think about transition then mail everyone.

I think that I created that and then deleted it a few years ago - perhaps
it does not really delete it so that it can be searched. Let me try to
create it as well, in case it remembers that I owned it at one time...
nope, I get the same issue. Sounds more like something is wrong at google.

However, perhaps you should pick a different name if this is going to
cover stringtemplate as well?

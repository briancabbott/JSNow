ModelAdapter and Renderer

 

Inheritance will work on this.  it's the only way polymorphism works with
template instantiation; same for adaptors/renderers.  If A imports B we
created templates relative to A even if defined in B.  Therefore, a renderer
for A works for B.  A's renderer overrides any you set in B as well.  No
need to think about propagation or whatever.

 

I think we don't need polymorphism for renderer/adapter lookup. Also I do
have my doubts polymorphism is an appropriate way to work with
renderers/adapters. 

 

The main reason is we are very limited in choosing the &quot;selector&quot; in the
renderer/adapter case, because we can only use the Java classes we want to
render/adapter. In the template lookup we are free to select any valid
template name and thus can easily decide if it will later be &quot;overloaded&quot; by
a calling group or not. In the renderer case in nearly all my
AttributeRenderers I am using &quot;String.class&quot; as the selector.

 

To explain this a little more and motivate a solution let me give you an
example.

 

I have a group J with this template:

 

--- template J.stg ---------------

javadoc(s) ::= &lt;&lt;

&lt;s;format=&quot;javadoc&quot;&gt;

&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>
-----------------------------------------

 

The template uses a custom attribute renderer (JavaDocRenderer) that renders
the given text as a JavaDoc comment, e.g.:

 

/**

 * hello

 */

 

The way to achieve this today is load the group J and register the
attributeRenderer for that group:

 

       groupJ.registerRenderer(String.class, new JavaDocRenderer());

 

The group J is a general purpose group, intended to be used in other groups.
Now lets discuss two different cases.

 

CASE A

======

 

I have a group main that imports J programmatically, to use the &quot;javadoc&quot;
template:

 

--- template main.stg ---------

main(cmt) ::= &lt;&lt;

&lt;javadoc(cmt)&gt;

.

&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>
-----------------------------------------

 

Rendering main will however not render the expected JavaDoc comment, as only
the AttributeRenderers registered to group main are used. 

 

So the way to cure this problem in the current implementation is to register
the JavaDocRenderer also to the main group:

 

       group.registerRenderer(String.class, new JavaDocRenderer());

 

If we would implement the &quot;inheritance&quot; mechanism as Terence suggested, this
extra statement would no longer be necessary, as the code will look for a
renderer of String.class in the current scope. It will find a renderer in J.
So here inheritance is fine.

 

CASE B

======

 

But now assume we have a slightly different main template:

 

--- template main.stg ---------

main(s,cmt) ::= &lt;&lt;

&lt;javadoc(cmt)&gt;

String f() {

   return &lt;s;format=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;;

}

&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>
-----------------------------------------

 

Here template main needs an attribute renderer for the &quot;quote&quot; format
(QuotedStringRenderer). Therefore we add this:

 

       group.registerRenderer(String.class, new QuotedStringRenderer());

 

Now the &quot;quote&quot; renders fine, however the JavaDoc is not ok. 

 

Note we cannot just add

 

       group.registerRenderer(String.class, new JavaDocRenderer());

 

to the main group as we have already registered a renderer for String.class.

 

Also the &quot;inheritance&quot; mechanism will not help here, as the lookup for a
renderer for String.class will find the QuotedStringRenderer in group main
and also use this one for the &quot;javadoc&quot; case.

 

 

PROPOSAL

=========

 

Instead of using inheritance we could make the attributeRender lookup a
simple two step approach: 

 

Before using the renderer as provided by the current implementation check if
the group containing the template using the &quot;format&quot; option defines an
appropriate renderer. If yes, use that, otherwise use the &quot;old&quot; one.

 

    protected int writePOJO(STWriter out, ST self, Object o, String[]
options) throws IOException {

        String formatString = null;

        if ( options!=null ) formatString =
options[Option.FORMAT.ordinal()];

                                

        AttributeRenderer r =
self.impl.nativeGroup.getAttributeRenderer(o.getClass());

        if (r == null) {

            r = group.getAttributeRenderer(o.getClass());

        }

        ...

 

This will work fine in both case A and case B.

 

This is a simple solution, simpler than any &quot;inheritance&quot; or &quot;propagation&quot;
approach. Actually I currently cannot think of a use case I would need
anything more sophisticated.

 

Note if someone prefers to define all renderers in the root group (and not
in imported groups) he is still free to do so. The proposed solution will
then automatically fall back to the current behavior (as no
attributeRenderers are found in the imported groups).

 

 

BTW: this suggested extension to the attributeRenderer lookup is not
directly related to the &quot;syntax extension&quot; I proposed. Actually the
&quot;programmatic&quot; approach to add renderers and do imports will benefit from
the new lookup rules as well.

The VM-wide setting approach seems like a possibility, but only if the &quot;VM&quot;

is an instance object. There are a number of cases where I run several

independent ST &quot;sessions&quot; within a single process, so I'm trying hard to

remove every last mutable static variable from the entire [C# port of the]

library. Perhaps an Interpreter object could be stored in an STGroup at the

time when the group is constructed, and that interpreter used for all

rendering of templates accessed through that group's getInstanceOf() method.

That way, we have a &quot;VM&quot; which is a single interpreter used for that group's

operations. I'd even go so far as to declare the Interpreter field of

STGroup final, giving a fixed view of the VM.

 

I used the term VM based on my understanding of the Java version. I 

would agree that it would be best not to have such things truly static - 

I would support a (for example) STInterpreter class, an instance of 

which can be used when creating a group, or it be specified with a 

boolean parameter that a new one should be created (otherwise a truly 

VM-wide default shared one would be used). I imagine implementation 

would be awkward if you could import groups that use a different 

STInterpreter from the one doing the important (depending on what 

actually gets stored in the instance), but otherwise it's a good way to 

share details of such things between multiple groups under control. 

Perhaps allow STInterpreters to be defined as 'children' of another 

STInterpreter, with any properties not specifically set in that child 

being proxied to the parent (implementation details could vary, but I 

can see that being easiest with a specialised subclass).

 

And yes, it would make sense for the interpreter of any given STGroup to 

be final, to whatever extent is possible in any given implementation 

language. You don't want to be changing back and forth all of those 

things after a group is created, though you may want to manipulate the 

interpreter itself.

 

This would also fit with the usual patterns used for such things in Java 

these days, particularly EE, allowing it to fit better with Dependency 

Injection and Contexts. It's definitely more common in my experience to 

have some sort of context class to hold such things than it is to have 

anything global/static.

Subject: Re: [stringtemplate-interest] Group Syntax extension for

ModelAdapter and Renderer

 

Sorry to top-post, but this is a very general statement/opinion...

 

Renderers and ModelAdapters need to be entirely in the programming side,

surely, to keep the complete language-agnostic value of template code.

Unlike Antlr grammars, for instance, there's nothing in a StringTemplate

that is ever language-specific (in terms of implementation), that I'm aware

of, and I devoutly hope it will remain so.

 

Furthermore, whether it happens at the programming level or in the group

file (and what about people not using group files, but group dirs or a

custom group type), whatever is chosen in terms of when to propagate and in

which direction, there will always be situations where what happens isn't

what makes sense for that use-case. Thus, what would really be ideal is a

way of controlling it more finely, as to when it propagates or doesn't, some

sort of configuration. This would, however, likely be a huge burden on the

ST developers, and a pretty big burden on those using it.

 

One alternative that occurs to me as probably working in most cases, is to

allow a VM-wide setting of model adapters and renderers, and then allow

group-specific overriding of this. Whether the group-specific ones then

propagate or not, and in which direction, I'm not sure. You obviously can't

have them propagating in both directions without every change always

affecting the whole constellation of groups involved, which would seem

suboptimal to me.

 

Anyway, that's just some software engineering thoughts. To get a better

decision, it would really make sense to drill down to some competing

use-cases and see if there's a common denominator that would work in all

cases that anyone can think of.

The &quot;propagation&quot; approach solves one half of the problem: with this

approach one could use renderers and adapters in groups that are

imported through the &quot;import&quot; statement (and not programmatically).

This is currently not possible.

 

But the other half of the problem still exists: assume I change a

group G and use some special renderer in the new version. The group G

is imported by many other groups (maybe indirectly). I now need to

find all the &quot;roots&quot; of imports to G and add the new renderer there.

This can really become a maintenance nightmare. Providing the

&quot;renderer&quot; syntax extension and defining the renderer in the group

text would solve this issue.

 

Regarding the implementation of the &quot;propagation&quot; approach:

registering a renderer will require to visit all directly and

indirectly imported groups and add the renderer to all of them,

possibly creating new maps etc.. Most of the times this will be extra

work as the imported groups don't reference that renderer. Propagating

a renderer to all imported groups may lead to a performance issue when

using large systems.

 

I would also hesitate to use the &quot;propagation&quot; approach as it adds a

new concept to StringTemplate (&quot;propagation of renderers&quot;) that in

addition seems to &quot;reverse&quot; an already existing concept

(&quot;inheritance&quot;). I guess this may to misunderstandings.

 

In contrast to this the &quot;renderer&quot; syntax extension does not use a new

concept but rather makes an existing feature (&quot;registerRenderer&quot;)

accessible to those users who prefer to work on the group text than

coding in Java.

 

As the &quot;propagation&quot; approach does not solve the whole problem I still

think we should add the &quot;renderer&quot;/&quot;adapter&quot; feature I suggested.

P.S.: all stuff mentioned regarding &quot;renderer&quot; also applied &quot;adapter&quot;.

This is an interesting problem. Normally when things are inherited,

they start at the imported group and propagate to the group that

imported them. In this case, it sounds like you want to propagate it

from the topmost group to all the groups it imports.

Perhaps the thing to do here is propagate renderers to groups

imported with STGroup.importTemplates(Token) (those are the ones

imported via the group file), but don't propagate them to groups

imported with a direct call to importTemplates(STGroup)?

If you look at the diff of TemplateGroup.cs in CL8734 (it's a small

diff), you can see how I adjusted the import code to handle the

unload() method in everyone's cases. If the java code is adjusted in

the same way (I can make the change if you want), then it's easy to

propagate renderers by the following two rules:

1.When STGroup.importTemplates(Token) is called, the current group's

renderers are added to the group that just got imported. This handles

the case where the renderer is registered before the group is

imported (especially relevant in reloading a group file after calling

unload()).

2.When a renderer is added to a group, it is automatically added (by

calling registerRenderer) to all groups in the importsToClearOnUnload

list. This handles the case where the group is imported before the

renderer is registered.

Hi,

currently we programmatically register ModelAdapters and Renderers to

an STGroup.

What about providing an extension to the syntax of Group to also

define these in a Group file?

E.g. I could imagine to use something like

 

   adapter &quot;org.w3c.dom.Node&quot;

   &quot;com.collinfagan.strum.adapters.xml.NodeModelAdapter&quot;

   renderer &quot;org.w3c.dom.Node&quot;

   &quot;com.collinfagan.strum.adapters.xml.NodeRenderer&quot;

 

at the top of an Group file. This would mean the same as running this

Java code for the group:

 

   group.registerRenderer(org.w3c.dom.Node.class, new

   com.collinfagan.strum.adapters.xml.NodeRenderer());

 

   group.registerModelAdaptor(org.w3c.dom.Node.class, new

   com.collinfagan.strum.adapters.xml.NodeModelAdapter());

 

Especially when importing groups this feature comes in handy as I

cannot register adapters/renderers when importing. In these cases I

must rely on the root group. For this group R we must register ALL

adapters/renders used in ANY group R imports. This make things hard

to maintain as using a &quot;new&quot; renderer in some template T requires me

to add the &quot;registerRenderer&quot; in EVERY code using T, maybe indirectly

through imports.

Similar to features discussed earlier this feature is easy to

implement for the STGroupFile, but the STGroupDir currently has no

proper place to hold this information. So we may also need to tackle

this re-appearing topic, too.

What do others think?

&gt;<i>I guess my concern is that if such a feature were in ST, that it not be
</I>&gt;<i>so simple to type that people would use it as the default true/false
</I>&gt;<i>test.
</I>
I don't see &quot;if.true&quot; becoming the default test.  FYI, I see &quot;if&quot;
(i.e., the common already in-use operator) as the default.  That's the
legacy code, so that's the likely default, not some newfangled
operator that is optional.

How about a name change from &quot;if.true&quot; to &quot;native.if&quot;?

By the way, this is just one feature or featureset, e.g., &quot;native.if&quot;.
 To me, it's not that complicated, and since it's optional, anyone can
avoid it.  The one or a few tests might not even need tweaking.  That
does not make for a confusing situation to me.  So, I do not see
logistical bugbear here.  I do see potential philosophical issues, but
no logistical nightmare.


&gt;<i>Do we wish to give up deterministic ST output production/ view
</I>
&gt;<i>generation so easily?
</I>
&gt;<i>I know I don't.
</I>
&quot;deterministic ST output&quot;:  Are you talking purity or practicality?
Purity prohibits even one operator of native compatibility.  That
would prohibit &quot;native.if&quot;?  Would that one instruction really
contaminate the entire instruction set?  Even if it were totally
isolated to one instruction?  One naming convention?  Well-documented?
 Easy-to-use for those who don't care about other languages?  What if
ST had a flag to warn/error on any use of &quot;native.if&quot;?  That would
solve the problem for portable ST;  just turnon the error flag, and ST
warns/errs on any &quot;native.*&quot; use.  Let the computer flag undesirable
use (or use global search to check).

The rest can use &quot;native.if&quot; with impunity.

&gt;<i> It would mean giving up cross-lang determinism of ST templates.
</I>
I do not think so.  Just turn on warnings/errors to prohibit
&quot;native.if&quot;, and don't use it.  Those experts writing portable ST
applications would avoid it &quot;like the plague&quot; as I pointed out in my
earlier post.

This linguistic confusion, IMO, is a non-issue.  It's trivially
flagged (naming convention), removed (search-and-replace), and avoided
(just don't use).  I doubt a broader base of ST would involve majority
writing portable ST.  Most just want tools that work on their one
machine.


&gt;<i> Need a concrete example of a problem it solves. Hasn't been an issue on
</I>&gt;<i> the lists before know, and this discussion so far we've had the luxury
</I>&gt;<i> of living in hypothetical land.
</I>
I'm confused.  This whole topic started with the discussion of
splitting &quot;if&quot; into &quot;if&quot; variants.  That's a real world issue from
this list.

&gt;<i> Again, there are more areas in st, where host-env specific stuff could
</I>&gt;<i> be applied. No point adding just one without also addressing the others.
</I>
Umm, I'm assuming this is the proverbial can of worms you are afraid
of?  Is that where all this confusion is coming from?  FYI, I am just
talking about this one feature (or some well-constrained variant), and
I think this feature has merit on its own.  (Let the other issues
stand on their own merits.)

-=-

I'm disappointed this conversation got off track, but then I probably
put too much in one message.  I think the various options I mentioned
raise some interesting potential uses for ST, but they were ideas (and
not concrete).

The basic issues to me at this point are whether a hook should be
added for multiple &quot;if&quot;s?  Whether to include a &quot;native.if&quot;?  Whether
to create an open-ended hook for customization at render time, e.g.,
&quot;native.*&quot;?

Perhaps &quot;native.*&quot; could be the namespace for open-ended render-time
hooks, and &quot;native.if&quot; would default to the native language
conditional and provide a simple example of such customization?

If so, the &quot;native.if&quot; could be there by default, but easily
customized by any programmer.  Frankly, most users (e.g.,
non-programmers) wouldn't care to customize, but necessity is the
mother of invention... so any user that needed/wanted to customize
could use the &quot;native.*&quot; ST operator namespace.  Then perhaps some
language/application specific ST customizations would start appearing!

Cheers,

= Joe =

P.s., no, I do not have any burning use cases for &quot;native.*&quot;.  Just
thinking aloud based on the split &quot;if&quot; semantics issue.

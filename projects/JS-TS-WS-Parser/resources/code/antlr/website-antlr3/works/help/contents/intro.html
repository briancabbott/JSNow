ANTLRWorks allows users to edit, visualize, interpret and debug any ANTLR 3 grammar through an easy-to-use graphical user interface.</p>		<p>The main features are:</p>		<ul>			<li>Grammar editor with syntax coloring</li>			<li>Dynamic syntax diagram or NFA representation</li>			<li>Integrated interpreter</li>			<li>Integrated, remote, language agnostic and TiVo-like debugger</li>			<li>Parse tree and AST in debugger</li>			<li>Grammar refactoring operations</li>		</ul>		<h1>System requirements</h1>		<p>Because ANTLRWorks has been written entirely in Java using Swing for its GUI, it can runs on any operating system implementing Java VM 1.5.</p>		<h1>Application behavior on different OSes</h1>		<p>ANTLRWorks will behave the way you expect an application to behave in your favorite operating system: on Mac OS X, a main menu bar is always displayed and the menu shortcuts are using the Apple command key. Windows and Linux users will have one menu bar per editor window and the menu shortcuts will be using the Control key.</p>		<p>In this Online Help, we will use the Command key to describe the control key to be pressed when invoking a menu command from the keyboard.</p>		<h1>Installation</h1>		<p>ANTLRWorks does not need to be installed: simply download it and launch it either by double-clicking its jar file (or the Mac OS X specific application package) and it will run. ANTLRWorks has ANTLR and StringTemplate already embedded in it.</p>		<p>To launch ANTLRWorks from the command line, use the command:</p>		<p class="command"><span>$ java -jar antlrworks.jar</span></p>		<p></p>	</body></html>

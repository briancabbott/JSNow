Move the mouse over a button to have a small tooltip displayed. Note that some of these buttons allow to go back in the stream of events: this is particularly useful when you want to replay a portion of events without having to stop and relaunch the debugger (note that the actions are executed only once, during the first pass).</li>			<li><span class="item"><strong>Break buttons</strong></span>: use these buttons to tell the debugger at which event it should break.				<ul>					<li>All: break on all events</li>					<li>Location: breaks on Location events (when the parser moves in the grammar)</li>					<li>Consume: breaks on Consume events (when the parser is consuming a token)</li>					<li>LT: breaks on LT events (when the parser is looking ahead)</li>					<li>Exception: breaks on Exceptions events</li>				</ul>			</li>			<li><span class="item"><strong>Status</strong></span>: status of the debugger.</li>			<li><span class="item"><strong>Detachable panels</strong></span>: there are six panels that can be detached from the main window using the <strong>Detach</strong> button. These panels are:				<ul>					<li>Input: shows the input tokens being consumed.</li>					<li>Output: shows the output from the parser being debugged.</li>					<li>Parse Tree: shows the parse tree</li>					<li>AST: shows the abstract syntax tree (if generated by the grammar)</li>					<li>Stack: shows the current stack of rules</li>					<li>Events: shows the list of events that have been sent by the parser to the debugger</li>				</ul>			</li>		</ul>		<h2>Remote Debugger</h2>				If the parser runs on another machine or has been generated in another language than Java, use the remote debugging feature of ANTLRWorks to connect to it.		<p></p>		<p></p>		<p></p>	</body></html>

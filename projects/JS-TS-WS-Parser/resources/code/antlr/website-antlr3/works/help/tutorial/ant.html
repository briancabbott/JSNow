This will build:				<ul>					<li>ANTLRWorks jar</li>					<li>ANTLRWorks.zip (the bundle for Mac OS Xif you are running on Mac OS X)</li>					<li>ANTLRWorksIDEAPlugIn.zip (the plugin for IntelliJ)</li>				</ul>			</li>		</ul>		<h4>Note:</h4>		<p>It is possible to replace the provided version of ANTLR or StringTemplate with your own version if you want. Put the jar file in the lib folder and change the build.properties accordingly.</p>		<p></p>		<p></p>	</body></html>

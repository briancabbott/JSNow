<b>gwenael.chailleu@gmail.com</b> <i>Thu Sep 27, 2012 09:11</i><br>
Just a few words to say that we used ANTLR V3.4 to create our own extension to C99. The baby is healthy and strong (please have a look at : http://melvenn.com/cawen/the-google-benchmark/) thanks to his antlr grammar flavoured feeding-bottles ! We are so happy that you can ask us to send you a photo of us dressed up as the cervidae of your choice !

<b>Mihai Surdeanu</b> <i>Tue Aug 28, 2012 09:29</i><br>
At Lex Machina (lexmachina.com) we use Antlr for information extraction from legal texts. We ended up implementing layers of grammars (first finding entities, then relations between them) all with Antlr! This architecture is similar to GATE but Antlr is so much faster! <br><br><a href="http://www.entrib.com"><b>Using ANTLR to build a query parser and translator</b></a><br>
<b>Atul Dambalkar (atul@entrib.com)</b> <i>Fri Jul 27, 2012 00:47</i><br>
We have been using ANTLR to build a query parser and then converting the generated tree into MongoDB query commands. It's been a great experience with ANTLR and it has helped us solve a complicated problem where we could now write SQL like queries to query MongoDB.<br><br>ANTLR makes building custom DSLs a breeze<br>
<b>Mukundan Agaram (Enterprise Architect at Delta Dental)</b> <i>Sat Feb 4, 2012 18:10</i><br>
We used ANTLR to build and parse custom Domain Specific Business Rule Languages that our Dental Subject Matter Experts use to articulate and automate complex business rules of adjudication and processing. <br><br>We all benefit from Antlr<br>
<b>Guido Leenders at Invantive</b> <i>Sat Jun 11, 2011 13:04</i><br>
We have developed a software package that integrates with Microsoft Excel and extends Excel by various features. However, in some complex situations we must look into the Excel formulas and parse them.<br><br>Great Tool<br>

I am a graduate from China and just learning your ANTLR. It's good but hard to learn for me.<br><br>Kudos<br>
<b>Guido van Rossum</b> <i>Sat Feb 7, 2009 10:46</i><br>
I'm actually really liking ANTLR! I have a pretty darn good velocity with a rapid prototyping project I am doing in my Google 20% time. For example, I just discovered a feature in rewrite rules that does exactly what I need (referencing previous rule ASTs, p. 174 in your book). It took me about 5 minutes to get this to work and remove an ugly wart from my grammar. Hats off!<br><br><a href="http://www.mathgladiator.com/projects/kira/"><b>Turning PHP into a functional PL</b></a><br>

I've been using ANTLR since the first SIGPLAN Notices printing of the PCCTS 1.0 user manual, back in 1989. It is still among my favourite tools in my bag of tricks. ANTLR 3 is a big improvement over that first version of PCCTS, but it still is very easy to understand, when compared to things like lex/yacc. Understandability is important when you're designing some mini-language, or crafting a parser for some existing grammar; I don't have time to get a Ph.D in yacc-ology!<br><br>Problem Solved<br>

Thanks for the hard work, as a new developer to ANTLR, I've actually wrapped my head far faster around v3 in an hour, than I have with a weeks reading into v2.  I'm having a blast using ANTLR with ColdFusion.  I've written the beginnings of my HQL like syntax for my ColdFusion ORM, and it's been absolutely brilliant.  Basically, I generated my Lexer and Parser with it, and my Parser outputs my AST. Rolling my own tree parser is so easy when using the type values as they are found against the Parser already generated by ANTLR.  It's just a case of recursively travelling through the AST and doing what I need as I travel down.  Honestly, couldn't be easier.  <br><br>V3 just seems to 'know' what I want<br>

I work for a software shop where in the early day of Java a logging library was developed. It is a long time ago that we wanted to migrate to log4j, but nobody had what it takes to migrate tens of thousands of files to use log4j instead of the hold, clumsy library. The refactoring power of our IDE was not enough to do the job, and manually editing tens of thousands of call sites was out of question. This was a pain for the developers team a long time.<p> When I came accross ANTLR I thought it could be useful to do the migration. It took 1 day to get use to the tool. Much to my delight, I discovered that ANTLR can generate code in Python, which is a very dynamic language on which I am very productive.<p>First I was disappointed to discover that to migrate overloaded methods I had to do some type inference, which is not that straightforwards. But then I combined the power of my IDE to refactor overloaded methods into method with unique names and then applied my Python scripts. The results amazed and positively surprised my peers.<p>Now we no longer have that old annoying libary anymore.<br><br>Do yourself a favour<br>

I was doing a project that needed a small language (well it was small when it started - isn't that the way).  I considered writing my own parser on the basis that the language was simple and I was on a deadline, and I didn't want to take the learning curve hit.  (I had used ANTLR some years earlier but I had forgotten most of that). In any event I decided to go with ANTLR.  That certainly was the right decision.<p> I found all kinds of examples on various web sites and I was able to put my language together pretty quickly.  It has grown and grown.  I am so glad that I decided to go with a real parser instead of some cobbled together Java code that I was thinking of.  Making changes to the grammar has been so easy with ANTLR.<p> ANTLR has saved me from the grunt work of doing all that parsing and let me concentrate on the specific constructs that I want.

Having been using ANTLR for around 6-7 months now, and being able to compare it against other tools such as SableCC, I can tell you that ANTLR is fantastic and a dream to use. It is incredibly flexible and powerful, allowing you to express your grammar in many different ways and providing you with multiple opportunities to insert actions of different kinds - both on the parser itself or the Abstract Syntax Tree with tree parsers. There are plenty of existing grammars available online which can be reused, or they can be used as a starting point for your own work. Additionally, they really help in showing you some of the more intricate detail in how to achieve different things with ANTLR. If you get stuck, there are numerous people on the mailing list who are willing to give you a push in the right direction who are all experts in different aspects - such as the C++/C#/Java generators or particular grammars that have already been created.  <br> <br> ANTLR can take a little bit of time to learn and some of the documentation and tutorials can be either too basic or too heavy (such as the "reference manual"). However, I have found it is worth the effort of learning - if you start out small with a simple, clean grammar (without actions) and then work upwards it becomes very easy to see how it all works. Furthermore, you can examine the highly readable output code understand what is going on. With ANTLR it is easy to overcome many of the common problems with grammars - syntactic and semantic predicates can help in overcoming ambiguities and non-determinisms by testing out different alternatives in "guess mode". Debugging is a breeze with recursive decent parsers, because you simply trace into each rule (as a method). However, it can take a while to run the code through to the exact input that breaks your parser, since rules can be called repeatedly based on different input.<br> <br> I found that after a while, top-down parsers are highly intuitive. Of course, when I went to switch to a bottom-up parser, it did take a little bit of time to understand the differences. For this reason, it is usually difficult for people to switch between LL and LR parsers the first time. However, doing a little bit of research about the different types of parsers pays off and within under 2-3 hours you should be up and running.  <br> <br> ANTLR also have many features which I haven't used yet - token stream filtering, splitting and multiplexing (for when you need to parse different parts of the file in different ways), AST tree reconstructions (for rewriting/replacing/restructuring text), etc. I can see that many of these features would be handy for different situations, and are not the sort of things that you find in most compiler toolkits.<br> <br> I did find a few difficult aspects though which might take a while to get your head around - when you have a non-determinism or ambiguity to be resolved, you have to know the grammar really well in order to work out the most appropriate syntactic predicate to resolve it - particularly when the non-determinism involves an alternative that continues within the rule or potentially "exits" the rule. Being able to work out what the next token might be can be challenging in these circumstances. However, ANTLR will consume greedily, so you can at least ignore non-determinisms temporarily until they become problematic. Also, many existing grammars are designed for LR parsers and this (potentially) requires a great deal of left-factoring to reduce conflicting rules and to eliminate left recursion. Whilst this can be a little time-consuming (and confusing with grammars you don't fully comprehend) you are then able to take advantage of some of the benefits - readability of the grammar is greatly improved and complexity is reduced. Furthermore, syntactic and semantic predicates make it very simple to understand how the parser/lexer will react in different situations.<br> <br> One thing I can recommend though, is to reduce the clutter of your grammar by separating the rules from the actions. I usually tab in about 50 spaces so that all the actions are aligned on the right-hand side of the screen and the rules are still readable on the left. Furthermore, I also usually have a copy of the grammar that doesn't have actions - just the rules themselves. This makes it much easier for someone else to come in and maintain/modify your work.<br> <br> Currently I have been using ANTLR with the Hibernate object-relational bridge to store the parsed text files into a relational database. The best way I have found of doing this is to generate Java classes containing all the contents to match your grammar (i.e. a Abstract Syntax Tree with concrete java objects). This can be time-consuming compared to SableCC's code generation, but you can limit the number of classes to exactly what you need rather than a class for each and every rule. Using actions in the parser, you can instantiate the java classes and then fill in the details as you encounter each token. I have been using the getter and setter methods that are required by Hibernate. Then I create the XML file required by Hibernate and "save" the top level constructs/classes. Hibernate takes care of the rest! The two pieces of software work really well together.<br> <br> I am really looking forward to ANTLR 3.x - from what I have read from Terence's blogs and the recent workshop, it promises to remove many of the remaining issues, such as left recursion and LL(*) parsing, multi-lingual errors and some of the performance issues that have been brought up on the list. It also sounds like it will have some very nifty features - like "channels" for parsing multiple streams of tokens from the same file. <br> <br> All in all, its an amazing tool. Thanks for Terence, Ric and many others who have made it available for all to use!<br><br>A Pleasure To Use<br>

# Antlr4Formatter

## Building

The project uses [maven wrapper](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper), so it's easy to build the project without worrying about having the right Maven version installed locally.

To build `antlr4-formatter` and the standalone utility `antlr4-formatter-standalone` run:

```sh
./mvnw clean package
```

## Using the standalone formatter

To format a grammar use the script `formatFile.sh` passing the grammar file as an argument to the script.  You can also use it with the Spotless plugin in [gradle](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-gradle#antlr4formatter) or [maven](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-maven#antlr4formatter).

## Maven Coordinates

```xml
<groupId>com.khubla.antlr4formatter</groupId>
<artifactId>antlr4-formatter</artifactId>
<version>1.2.1</version>
<packaging>jar</packaging>
```

## Contributing

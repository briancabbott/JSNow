# egg

*Egg* is a programming language loosely inspired by Lua.

It includes associative arrays, lexical scope, and a simple mark-and-sweep garbage collector.

To build `egg`, first build `owl`.  Then run `make`:

```
$ make
```

and try it out on some example code:

```
$ ./egg example/hello.egg
```

See the `example/` directory for more example egg programs.

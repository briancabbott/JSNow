# Troubleshooting missing or unexpected Error List entries

We no longer show diagnostics of closed JavaScript/TypeScript files in the error list by default in order to get you faster performance and show you relevant errors. If you do choose to enable it in closed files, you can go to Tools > Options > Text Editor > JavaScript/TypeScript > Project and uncheck the option to "Only report diagnostics for files opened in the editor".

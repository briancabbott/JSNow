# JsDoc support

Programs written in JavaScript and TypeScript can be annotated with [JsDoc comments](http://usejsdoc.org/index.html)
to give type information and quickinfo descriptions of identifiers.

In the following example, the text between the opening `/**` and closing `*/` are considered JsDoc comments.

```js
/**
 * Creates a new animal object.
 * @param {string} name The name of the new animal.
 * @param {number} weight
 * @param {"cat" | "dog"} kind
 * @return {{name: string, weight: number, kind: "cat" | "dog"}} A brand new animal!
 */
function createAnimal(name, weight, kind)
{
    // ...
}
```

As you can see, we can prefix sections in JsDoc with terms such as `@param` and `@return` to describe the behavior of the `createAnimal` function.
In JsDoc, terms beginning with `@` have special meanings, and are called *tags*. The text between curly braces are descriptions of *types*,
which can be used by the developer to check that they are using a variable correctly &mdash; they should precede the *name* of the construct being described, if applicable.
In the example above, knowing that `weight` is a number can inform the developer to avoid calling `weight.length`.
Moreover, if the result of `createAnimal` is assigned to a variable, the return type of createAnimal propagates to the assigned value.

Both Jsdoc and TypeScript type annotations are supported. For example, `kind` is described as a union of string literals using TypeScript syntax.

Finally, the text spans before the first tag and after parameter names are *descriptions*, which shows up as part of quickinfo anytime you hover over a construct that is documented.

and while filling in the paramaters in a function call.

Different constructs in JavaScript can use different forms of documentation, as described below.

Visual Studio offers a rich editing experience inside JsDoc comments. The editor offers auto-completion on tags, names, and types as well as auto-indentation. You can use F12 and Shift+F12 for Go-to-definition and Find-All-References, respectively, as well hovering for quickinfo.

## Supported Tags

Any tag may be used for documentation, but Visual Studio treats some tags specially to improve the editor's ability to catch errors and help with refactoring.
The following tags are handled specially. Each tag is followed by a description and example.

* `@param` &mdash; describes a parameter to a function. Type annotations and descriptions are optional.

```ts
/**
 * Repeats a string a certain number of times.
 * Also: the future is bright and consists of native string repetition:
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/repeat
 *
 * @param {string} string  String to repeat
 * @param {number} times   Number of times to repeat string. Integer.
 * @see http://jsperf.com/string-repeater/2
 */
function repeatString(string, times) {
  if (times === 1) {
    return string;
  }
  if (times < 0) { throw new Error(); }
  var repeated = '';
  while (times) {
    if (times & 1) {
      repeated += string;
    }
    if (times >>= 1) {
      string += string;
    }
  }
  return repeated;
}
```

* `@return` &mdash; describes the return value of a function. Type annotations and descriptions are optional.

```ts
/**
 * Determine if the string ends with the specified substring.
 *
 * @param {string} haystack String to search in
 * @param {string} needle   String to search for
 * @return {boolean}
 */
function endsWith(haystack, needle) {
  return haystack.slice(-needle.length) === needle;
}
```

* `@class` &mdash; tells Visual Studio to treat the next function as a constructor. (Only available in JavaScript files)

```ts
var Cell = /** @class */ (function () {
    function Cell() {
    }
    return Cell;
}());
```

* `@augments` and `@extends` &mdash; if the next construct is a class declaration, specifies which class the upcoming declaration extends. Note that `@augments` and `@extends` are synonyms.
The following advanced example shows how to use `@augments` to instantiate a generic class from a TypeScript file

```ts
// @Filename: declarations.d.ts
class Thing<T> {
     mine: T;
 }

// @Filename: dummy.js
 /**
  * @augments {Thing<string>}
  */
 class MyStringThing extends Thing {
     constructor() {
         // x is a string!
         var x = this.mine;
     }
 }
```

* `@template` &mdash; used to specify type parameters for the following function (c.f. generic programming)

```ts
/**
 * @param {T} a
 * @template T
 */
function f(a) {
    return () => a
}
let n = f(1)();
```

* `@type` &mdash; declares the type of the next construct:

```ts
/** @type {{key: "value"}} */
var x = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify({key: "value"}));
```

* `@typedef` &mdash; Typedef tags can be used to declare types referenced in other JsDoc comments.
If a type is specified inline (in the same style as `@param`), that describes the shape of the `@typedef`'d name.
Alternatively, A JsDoc beginning with a `@typedef` tag and name can be followed by `@property` and `@member` tags to describe the shape of the named type.

```ts
/**
 * @typedef {{foo: number}} Foo1
 */

/**
 * @typedef Foo2
 * @property {number} foo
 */

/** @type {Foo1} */
const x = { foo: 0 };
```
* `@property` and `@member` &mdash; used to describe properties as part of a `@typedef` type declaration. See above for an example.

## Type Syntax

Visual Studio supports both [JsDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/tags-type.html#overview) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html) syntax for type annotations. Since TypeScript [has a more expressive type system](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html), we recommend using the latter.

## JsDoc Scaffolding Support

If you would like to add JsDoc comments to an existing javascript construct, typing `/**` in front of a construct in Visual Studio will trigger scaffolding generation, which will stub out
JsDoc for the next construct:

Scaffolding-generation is supported for the following constructs:

* function declarations
* method declarations
* constructor declarations
* method signatures
* variable statements
* most property assignments &mdash; module import and export statements are excluded

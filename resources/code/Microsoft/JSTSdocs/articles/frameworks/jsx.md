# JSX & React support

You can write JSX syntax in Visual Studio with full Intellisense support.

## With JavaScript

If you're using JavaScript, you can use JSX syntax in either .js or .jsx files.
You'll automatically see Intellisense for the latest version of React when in a .jsx file, or if a .jsx  file is anywhere in your project.

Primary documentation for this feature can be found at [the Microsoft docs page for JavaScript in Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/scripting/javascript/javascript-in-vs-2017) (see section "JSX syntax support").

## With TypeScript

JSX syntax is supported in TypeScript when the file's extension is .tsx.
You can also use a custom JSX types package (i.e. one other than `@types/react`) and specify a different JSX emit when targeting non-React JSX frameworks.
See the TypeScript React starter project in the Additional Resources section for more information.

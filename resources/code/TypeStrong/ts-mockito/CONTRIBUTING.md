This is a fork of [`ts-mockito`](https://github.com/NagRock/ts-mockito/), published separately as `@typestrong/ts-mockito`

We hope to eventually merge back with upstream `ts-mockito` and publish to the `ts-mockito` npm name, but until then, a fork lets us add new features.

# Publishing

Release notes / changelogs are published to Github Releases.  
For examples of how this looks, see here: https://github.com/NagRock/ts-mockito/releases
and here: https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-mockito/releases

We publish to npm using `np`, which is a CLI tool that handles the repetitive tasks of publishing safely.

## Staff
* Champion: Frank Yung-Fong Tang
* Stage 3 Reviewers (To be requested/signed up while advancing to Stage 2):
  * TBD

## Motivation
This proposal aim to improve the [Intl.Segmenter](https://tc39.es/proposal-intl-segmenter/) API with:
* ~~A way to segment the text with a batch call to minimize the number of calls between user calls and internal implementation.~~
* Add line break granularity to support high end ECMAScript based text layout applications which already have a way to measure the text width but need a way to access logical line break points.

## Use Cases
### ~~Batch Mode~~

Note: The "Batch Mode" is removed from the proposal after careful discussion with some intended users. 
### Line Break Granularity
* **From @gibson042:** Formatting in a monospace context, such as a CLI or GitHub source diff.
* For non-HTML context while font metrics is available 
* &lt;text&gt; in SVG and https://d3js.org/ 
* To avoid the misue of word break in the place for line break. (Canvas drawstring and SVG usecase)
* Being persistently requested by users even after the shipment of Intl.Segmenter
* **From @my2iu :** It is becoming increasingly common now for web apps to have custom text rendering, and these web apps need an API for line segmentation to be able to lay out text in lines with wrapping. HTML/CSS are too high-level to provide the font support that many web apps need, so low-level API is needed. Line-breaking libraries tend to be fairly large, so it's not really practical to directly bundle them in web apps either, so it would be better if the browser could provide this functionality. Custom text rendering is used in
  * application web apps for word processing, vector illustration, paint programs, svg visualizations, etc any web page that needs to render text in WebGL or VR/AR (via WebXR). 
  * Good-looking text in 3d engines is commonly implemented using signed-distance fields, which requires a custom text renderer
* **From @HackbrettXXX , contributor to jsPDF**:
  * Creating text documents of any kind: e.g. PDF with jsPDF: jsPDF offers functionality to automatically split text into lines. However, currently it only supports Western-style line breaks: words = text.split(" "). Adding Line Break to Intl.Segmenter could improve that. In jsPDF, the text is measured by loading the font files and calculating the text size from the glyph sizes.
  * Rendering multiline text in a context in the browser where HTML/CSS layout cannot be used, e.g. when using SVG, canvas, or WebGL for rendering. Here, the text can be measured with canvas' measureText() or SVG's getComputedTextLength() or getBBox().
* **From @mdebbar , contributor to Flutter Web**:
  * Needed for [Text layout in Flutter Web](https://gist.github.com/mdebbar/93886d22a4cd40e050d1533d7e0016bf#1-line-breaks).

# TODO of the repo
 
  1.  Avoid merge conflicts with build process output files by running:
      ```sh
      git config --local --add merge.output.driver true
      git config --local --add merge.output.driver true
      ```
  1.  Add a post-rewrite git hook to auto-rebuild the output on every commit:
      ```sh
      cp hooks/post-rewrite .git/hooks/post-rewrite
      chmod +x .git/hooks/post-rewrite
      ```
  1. changes to `spec.emu` (ecmarkup uses HTML syntax, but is not HTML, so I strongly suggest not naming it ".html")
  1. Any commit that makes meaningful changes to the spec, should run `npm run build` and commit the resulting output.
  1. Whenever you update `ecmarkup`, run `npm run build` and commit any changes that come from that dependency.

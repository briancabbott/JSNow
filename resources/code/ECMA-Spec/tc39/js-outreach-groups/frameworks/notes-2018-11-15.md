Agenda and notes

(Note: No need to read this agenda or the links in advance, but if you're interested, here's some topics)

* Follow-up from last meeting
    * Class fields, Set vs Define
        * Frameworks seem split, reflecting the understanding of the committee in 2016/2017 when the Define call was made
        * Not clear what to raise to TC39
        * Ensuring that decorators can choose Set behavior [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators/pull/165](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators/pull/165) 
        * Details [https://github.com/littledan/js-outreach-groups/blob/master/frameworks/notes-2018-10-18.md#set-vs-define-follow-up](https://github.com/littledan/js-outreach-groups/blob/master/frameworks/notes-2018-10-18.md#set-vs-define-follow-up) 
            * DE: Could we use Define, and allow decorators to switch to Set?
            * YK: And a class decorator could make everything Set?
            * DE: Yes, it could, for all public fields
            * YK: This meets my requirements
            * MW: Mine as well, at least the hard requirements
            * JH: Yes, it seems critical that decorators have been updated. I argued for Set before as a default, and would prefer that you use a decorator for Define, but I can accept the other default as long as it's re-settable with a decorator.
            * YK: People abstractly want define, since it feels right; it's the first place in the language where we use Define
            * DE: Well, except object literals, which switched to Define to avoid setters on Object.prototype
            * YK: It's good to think about what power users do vs regular users
            * DE: OK, given that YK shared this feedback two years ago to the committee, is there anything more that we need to bring to TC39?
            * JH: As we've explained class fields to people on the repositories, they have come to learn the logic. Some people are continuing to argue about 
            * MW: I agree with Jordan that Set would be a nicer default, but if it won't change at Stage 3, so be it
    * Interaction of this call with TC39 stage process
        * Let's get out in front, and make sure proposals have adequate feedback before advancing too far in TC39's process
        * For Stage 3 proposals, available for information
        * For Stage 2 proposals, let's work out details, make sure edge cases are handled well, scoped properly
        * For Stage 0/1 proposals, assessing priority/is-it-worth-it; really any feedback at all
            * MW: OK, that makes sense
            * YK: I agree too
    * Notes posted at [https://github.com/littledan/js-outreach-groups/tree/master/frameworks](https://github.com/littledan/js-outreach-groups/tree/master/frameworks) 
        * No problem
* Review of proposals
    * Optional Chaining? [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining) 
        * Three forms (which of these are critical? can any be deferred?):
            * x?.y
            * x?.[y]
            * x?.()
        * Extra . due to parsing concerns: ?. has tighter precedence than ? :, using ?[ and ?( would require backtracking/re-parsing
        * Controversies
            * Is it worth it to add anything into JS at all?
            * Should we avoid the extra . by switching to x??.y, x??[y], x??() [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining/issues/34](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining/issues/34) 
            * Should we remove some of these cases? [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining/issues/59](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining/issues/59) 
            * null?.x evaluates to null or undefined? [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining/issues/69](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining/issues/69) 
                * YK: This one is the one I'm most concerned about, and I realize that this has significant divergence in opinions across the committee. 
            * Short-circuiting [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining/issues/3](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining/issues/3) 
        * Related proposal: Nullish coalescing: [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-nullish-coalescing](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-nullish-coalescing)
            * Alternative discussed (proposed by Godfrey Chen): ||| "default operator" (switch based on the left arg being undefined)
        * IM: For Angular, we strongly support this proposal. We transpile this in some cases, and we would love it to happen everywhere. It would make users happier and more productive. I would be willing to go with just ?.
        * RF: I miss this from Groovy
        * YK: I am also positive on ?. I think the bulk of the value comes from ?. If it were up to me, I would start with ?.
        * IM: I agree. ?. would be 95% of the use cases.
        * JH: In general, I don't actually care if they are shipped all at once, or in 2-3 separate pieces. I agree that optional member access is the most important one. But I think it's important for teachability that any optional access operators look pretty much the same. That's an argument for figuring out what the grammar would be for the others. So, I'm not convinced that it's possible to ship them independently. I don't think it would be a good place to land to allow it for string properties
        * DE: Opinions about symbols? Are they too unergonomic to use in practice?
        * MW: I use symbols a lot, but I'm not sure I’m representative
        * YK: Are you including the call syntax?
        * MW: Yes. I think it’s valuable. In our codebase we have a lot of symbols and it would be really useful, but I'm not sure if I'm representative.
        * AB: We don't use symbols at all.
        * Manu: I think there’s no support for symbols in IE11, and they use weakmaps, so we decided not to use symbols.
        * JH: I expect that to change in a few years
        * YK: Protocols proposal might also change this. Ember uses symbols because of the non-enumerablility (not included in for-in).
        * DE: Thoughts on x??.y ?
        * IG: It makes too much visual noise. I would prefer ?. for regular, and ?.[ for other cases.
        * YK: The issue is that people will assume it’s ?[ for bracket access.
        * DE: I don’t think debating the options is useful, I’m only interested in collecting opinions of using ?. vs changing it to be symmetric.
        * Manu: I think ?.[
        * YK: Does that hold for ?.(?
        * DE: Are you saying you don’t like ?.[?
        * RF: I’m basically on the same page as YK. I like `?.`. I don’t see the need to elaborate on it any further. The 95% use case is just ?.
        * DE: Sometimes in the committee, it’s hard to see how frequent that opinion will be with the wider community. Sounds like a lot of people want ?. even if we don’t ship the others.
        * YK: I think the issue is we’re worried about painting ourselves into a corner with the bracket access.
        * JH: In the future when people aren’t shying away from symbols because of browser support, we’re gonna miss bracket access.
        * YK: How does the group feel about optional call syntax? Does anyone feel that we should prioritize it with the original?
        * MW: Yes.
        * DE: You would be able to do it with optional property access. Whether call operations happen is separate.
        * RF: What’s the usecase behind this?
        * JH: Some React components could optionally have render methods, etc.
        * YK: Are you assuming call is based on typeof?
        * DE: It’s not based on typeof.
        * JRL: I think this is one of the why we should separate.
        * YK: I think the question is: does anyone want to prioritize it now, or can we do it later?
        * DE: The current status is: Stage 1 with an implementation in Babel. We’re really looking for opinions on these questions. I think Facebook turned it on internally, and in React by default. Even if you’re not on the committee, you’re still in positions of influence.
        * YK: Ember is still stalled because of the null vs undefined return value.
        * DE: Oh, can we talk about this?
        * JH: The most compelling argument I’ve heard for each: always undefined mirrors the normal access if the property didn’t exist on the object. For null return, it just gives a bit more info. I’m more swayed to always returning undefined.
        * YK: My question was what’s the input falsey. Does null short circuit?
        * DE: Would you have it throw a typeerror?
        * YK: I’m sorry, I’m confused. I think it should short circuit on null and undefined.
        * DE: There was a bug that was opened about the return value. Most libraries always return undefined. But IDX returns null or undefined. In my opinion, we should stay with undefined.
        * MW: I agree.
    * (Igor) The pipeline operator [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/) 
        * Four possible options
            * :: bind operator [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bind-operator](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bind-operator) 
            * "Smart" pipeline [https://github.com/js-choi/proposal-smart-pipelines/](https://github.com/js-choi/proposal-smart-pipelines/) 
            * "F#" pipeline [https://github.com/valtech-nyc/proposal-fsharp-pipelines/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/valtech-nyc/proposal-fsharp-pipelines/blob/master/README.md) 
            * (or not add the feature)
        * Feedback-based approach [https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/07/19/whats-happening-with-the-pipeline-proposal](https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/07/19/whats-happening-with-the-pipeline-proposal) 
        * Documentation and Babel transforms in progress
        * Discussion topics
            * What sorts of patterns would be enabled by pipeline, which frameworks might take advantage of?
            * Would this feature be potentially confusing?
        * IG: Initially you said that some people were worried that it wouldn’t be worth it. Angular has been using something like this for years, and it’s highly requested.
        * DE: Does anyone ever get confused?
        * IG: No. They want it in normal code because it’s currently only available in our template expressions.
        * RF: Elm has it, and it’s widely popular. It uses F# semantics, though, because functions are curried.
    * (Any other topics to discuss?)
* Meetings in the future
    * Does December 20th at 19:00 work, or should we cancel for the holidays? 
        * Meet in January
    * Any more feedback? (make sure it's recorded in the notes)

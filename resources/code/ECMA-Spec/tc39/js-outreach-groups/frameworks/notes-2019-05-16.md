Agenda and notes:

* Internationalization - Zibi Braniecki
    * ECMA-402 present state [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) 
    * ECMA-402 proposals under discussion [https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/ecma402/README.md](https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/ecma402/README.md) 
    * Project Fluent 1.0 [https://projectfluent.org/](https://projectfluent.org/) 
    * Potential standardization of Project Fluent
    * Dan: *presents Intl*
    * Dan: feedback is that the objects are awkward to use, so some use frameworks
    * Dan: should we add higher-level management functions, hook into DOM?
    * OC: Angular used to use the APIs, but they were buggy/inconsistent in browsers.  We implemented our own, basic subset.  We had 10-20 bugs, or, differences between implementations that we couldn't resolve between implementations.
    * Dan: The webkit folks seem excited/supportive of it, but it isn't a high priority for them I think.
    * AVK: Did you file bugs?
    * OC: Yes, they were open for a long time.  Defining our own, we were able to make the API a lot simpler, but we had to develop a system to load the language data. The advantage is that it works the same across all browsers.
    * JF: I was wondering if there was a way to make a wrapper so that you don't have to load data where there is good support
    * Dan: The api is quite complex, I can see how it could be hard to only use part of it. What do others do
    * OC: React uses react.intl which is a wrapper around the native impls if I am not mistaken
    * Dan: what about polymer
    * JF: There have been some efforts to wrap format.js - it uses Intl under the hood and we recommend that you use a polyfill.  That's in classic polymer. In lit-html we don't really do/say anything specific on this point.
    * _zibi presents on fluent_

    * DE:  You mentioned that there were conversations about standardization or integrating into thingsâ€¦ Where are those conversations happening and how can we be involved?
    * ZB: No, this is just something we worked on internally with a polyfill that was geared to be open to a standardization path and get us thinking about it.
    * _some discussion about modules vs web components_
    * JF: I think we should discuss this in general in more depth somewhere where we have a lot of time, but I think this is actually kind of interesting input to the discussion about module loading because maybe there is something we are missing on top of fetch about a way for that to participate with the loader and the module graph - that seems more immediately relevant and interesting than the web components bit.  It's like a general problem.
    * DE: Are there other examples that you are unsure of, this seems like a 'generally interesting' problem across the web space.  Maybe we can talk about how frameworks manage this.
    * OC: There are a couple of ways. Right now you have to generate a bundle for each locale. It's kind of a burden, building can take a few hours once you have hundreds of locales. This is the main reason why we are moving to runtime translations. We are making some tradeoffs on performance but fixing a bunch of issues: being able to load translations on the fly, doing code translations (not just templates like it is the case right now) and having one bundle for all locales. We will also let people replace parts of the runtime APIs if they want so that they can customize parts of i18n to suit their needs.
Internally we will still use the Closure compiler to load translations at build time because we have the infrastructure to handle longer build times and we prefer to keep the performance as best as possible.
    * JF: How fast is the parser for parsing fluent messages in js
    * ZB: The tooling parser, the full parser is fairly slow - but we also have a runtime parser that is pretty fast, and we also have a rust parser which is very fast.
    * JF: Is there an option to complete the messages into JS
DB: I have seen compilers to python for example.  I saw eemeli start to create a parser for JavaScript.  There might even be an npm package by now.  We have not seen this be a problem yet though. 
JF: Link to the faster runtime parser?
    * ZB: [https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/blob/master/fluent/src/resource.js](https://meet.google.com/linkredirect?authuser=0&dest=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fprojectfluent%2Ffluent.js%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Ffluent%2Fsrc%2Fresource.js) 
    * ZB: eemili compiler - [https://github.com/eemeli/fluent-compiler/tree/master](https://github.com/eemeli/fluent-compiler/tree/master)
    * OC: One thing I forgot to mention is that we will probably use a new JSON format because parsing XML files at runtime would be a nightmare
    * DE: Are there things in the browser that are missing to make this work well as a JavaScript module today?
    * ZB: The main thing was PluralRules in the browser, which are coming. This is the next thing to explore.
    * ZB: DOM Overlays - [https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/wiki/DOM-Overlays](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent.js/wiki/DOM-Overlays)
        * Proposal for v3 of DOM Overlays - [https://github.com/zbraniecki/fluent-domoverlays-js/wiki/New-Features-(rev-3)](https://github.com/zbraniecki/fluent-domoverlays-js/wiki/New-Features-(rev-3))
    * There may be opportunity for Fluent and Angular to collaborate here

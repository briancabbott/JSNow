Agenda & notes

* New attendee introductions
* Notes now available at [https://github.com/littledan/js-outreach-groups](https://github.com/littledan/js-outreach-groups) 
    * Should we use this repo for anything else?
* Review how we will interact with the stage process
    * DE: A lot of controversy is around stage 3 proposals. I would suggest that we get involved earlier, at stage 2 or earlier. If we try to focus on that and provide refinements at that level we might have more impact. For stage 3 we might want to focus on documentation and learning materials. How does tht sound as an organizing principle?
    * JE: sounds good. For me it would be good to focus on specific proposals, so its hard to talk about all of them. I also don’t know all the terms. 
    * DE: what if we take one or two proposals each month and focus on those? We also have a glossary of terms that we are planning to publish soon. So if this group is interested we can maybe help fill that in.
    * We had this discussion with BigInt, but then unreceptivity to feedback because Stage 3/already shipping… sad-face!
    * Let's focus on being complementary to TC39, and provide feedback to be taken into account *before* that group makes decisions (let's get out ahead in front!)
    * For Stage 3 proposals, distribute information (TC39 to this group, this group to learners)
    * For Stage 2 proposals, working out details, making sure edge cases are handled well, scoped properly
    * For Stage 0/1 proposals, assessing priority/is-it-worth-it; really any feedback at all
* Feature review
    * Pipeline operator [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator/) 
        * Four possible options
            * :: bind operator [https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bind-operator](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bind-operator) 
            * "Smart" pipeline [https://github.com/js-choi/proposal-smart-pipelines/](https://github.com/js-choi/proposal-smart-pipelines/) 
            * "F#" pipeline [https://github.com/valtech-nyc/proposal-fsharp-pipelines/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/valtech-nyc/proposal-fsharp-pipelines/blob/master/README.md) 
            * (or not add the feature)
        * Feedback-based approach [https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/07/19/whats-happening-with-the-pipeline-proposal](https://babeljs.io/blog/2018/07/19/whats-happening-with-the-pipeline-proposal) 
        * Documentation and Babel transforms in progress
        * Discussion topics
            * How should we analyze this proposal?
            * How does it relate to functional programming?
            * What patterns does it enable?
            * Is it teachable?
        * DE: I chose this one because sarah asked for it, but she isn’t here today. Should we jump to the ones that Johannes added?
    * (Add further topics if you'd like!)
    * If time, our feature backlog:
        * Console semantics [https://github.com/bmeck/js-repl-goal](https://github.com/bmeck/js-repl-goal) 
            * Currently looking for a champion, this is regarding with what happens when you are writing stuff in a devtools console. Is this something that causes difficulty for people learning js?
            * JE: I don’t think so to be honest. I ran into edge cases maybe 4 or 5 times in my whole career, and personally i doubt beginners would run into these. But of course its not a bad thing to standardize, because there are edge cases. 
            * WK: If someone can be passionate about that, because i can see that as useful for automation. We used to make lots of [videos](https://vimeo.com/search?q=learnjs) on firefox of how to do different things.
            * YS: how do you imaging the automation?
            * WK: using the console to be automatically checking katas etc
            * DE: ah that might be out of scope
            * WK: can you summarize?
            * DE: for example something that starts with an `{` -- in code that would be treated as a block, but in the console it would be an object
            * DE: if someone pushes this forward in tc39 it has a good chance of being implemented. Its not hard, but we need agreement
        * Module syntax (export vs default export)
            * JE: when i teach modules in the class, regular exports are much easier to teach than default. The mixture that you can do both is really confusing people. The problem was also there with common.js - that module.exports wasn’t clear. 
            * DE: hm this is already implemented so we won’t be able to do much to change this. One thing that we talked about was that default export has a few extra rules applied to it. <was in another window sorry>
        * try/catch ergonomics (forces to use let, catching specific errors is hard) [https://github.com/zenparsing/es-typed-catch](https://github.com/zenparsing/es-typed-catch) 
            * JE: Not something i observed in class, just a personal observation. I use const everywhere. But with try catch, i have to use let to get it out of the block. I don’t know if any other developers have observed a similar problem
            * YS: I end up using assignments that aren't necessary, and do expressions could help, e.g., for an if statement
            * DE: Do expressions may be difficult and controversial
            * YS: we also have well established patterns for this that can be taught, the result is just not so pretty.
            * JE: I have to look into the do expression proposal. Maybe there is a chance to merge it that the try block can evaluate to something. The other ergonomic problem is that in javascript catching specific errors is really hard. Luckily you don’t have to do it that often, but when you do you have to rely on parsing the error. And its more of on a language level than on an application level. I don’t know if node has improved this
            * DE: error codes help with this in node
            * JE: if there is an effort to standardize error stacks, we should also look into standardizing error codes. 
            * DE: that makes sense; to clarify, js-better-errors is not really standardizing messages, just providing suggestions
            * Error stacks proposal: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-error-stacks
* Documentation/error messages efforts
    * Better error messages [https://github.com/codehag/js-better-errors](https://github.com/codehag/js-better-errors) 
        * Repo is created, looks good, got retweets, not much data yet
        * Next steps? Work with groups of developers to populate it?
        * Yulia: Let's make the website more interactive, using Brian Terlson's repl. This could feed into the website, to make it easier to create issues. This could also influence the error stack proposal.
    * MDN documentation
        * Ongoing efforts for decorators, class fields, async iterators, BigInt, pipeline, optional chaining
        * Is working with MDN going well? 
        * DE: last meeting we talked about the importance of making documentation of the tc39 process. And we had some discussion with mdn, and the idea now is to have a header that explains in progress items. mdn is happy to create a way for web developers to be more involved in standards. We currently have people working on decorators, big int and others, some from this group and some from outside. Is anyone here interested to get involved? 
        * Sergei: I can try to help
        * JE: yeah the biggest challenge is to allocate time for it. What would be the best way to approach this topic? Should I approach the champion?
        * DE: yeah that sounds good.
* Meeting planning
    * December 13th, 17:00 UTC?
    * Should we invite anyone else?
    * (Does anyone want to set up a Doodle rather than continuing at the regular time?)

## Scope

To provide a forum for the discussion, development and dissemination of research work on the standardization of ECMAScript® (the JavaScript™ programming language) and related technologies.

### Programme of work

1. To summarize and present ongoing research work from the academic community on JavaScript™ and adjacent technologies.
1. To investigate and discuss state-of-the-art approaches to aid the development of TC39 proposals (drawing from areas such as: formalisms, programming language theory, human computer interaction, social science).
1. To produce documentation on best practices from research work to ECMAScript® standardization.
1. To produce and present tools and technologies to aid in the understanding and design of standards for ECMAScript® and adjacent technologies.
1. To continue and broaden the work, in addition to ECMAScript®, with a general investigation of programming languages standardization.
1. To establish and maintain liaison with other Ecma TCs and other standardization bodies as appropriate to facilitate and promulgate the work of the TG, including dissemination in academic and industrial publishing venues.

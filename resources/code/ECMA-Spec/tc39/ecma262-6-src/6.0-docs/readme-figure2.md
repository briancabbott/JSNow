The UML diagram that is figure 2 was created using the astah community edition UML editor, which is available for free at
(http://astah.net/editions/community).

The source file for the diagram is "ES core generator objects ES6.asta" in this directory.

Note after editing the diagram it needs to be exported as png file. A pixel editor needs to then be used to remove the astah water mark from the diagram before inserting into the Word document.

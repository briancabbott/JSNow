# ECMA-262 6th Edition Source Files

This repository contains the source files and tools used to create
the  **ECMAScript 2015 Language Specification**.

The 6th edition has been published and is frozen.  If you want to create  a new edition,
derived from the 6th edition, start by cloning this repository. Then rename appropriate files
to match the new edition name.

The directory `6.0-docs` contains the source files. The file named `"ECMA-262 6th Edition (final).docx"`
is the primary source file. `"ECMA-262 6th Edition (final).doc"` is the .doc equivalent of the .docx file.

The directory `es-spec-html` contains the programs that are used to generate an HTML version
of the specification from the .docx version.

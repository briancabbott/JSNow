# JavaScript Type System Syntax Comparison

The table included below compares the syntax used for various type system
constructs and other applications of types such as type annotation sites.

| Generic type application without call       | `f<S>`                                                     | N/A                                                           | N/A                             |                                | Added in TS 4.7. Generic functions or other values can be instantiated without a call-site. As above, this can’t be supported as-is in JS. |

| Union type                                  |  `S \|  ... \| T`                                            | Same as TS                                                    | Same as TS                      | Same as TS                     | |
| Maybe / option type                         | N/A                                                        | `?T`                                                          | Same as Flow                    | `?T` or `T=`                   | In Flow, `?T` allows null and undefined. Hegel only allows undefined. Closure compiler defines nullable types (`?`) and optional types (`=`). |
| Intersection type                           | `type & type`                                              | Same as TS                                                    | N/A                             | N/A                            | |
| Top type                                    | `unknown`                                                  | `mixed`                                                       | Same as TS                      | `*`                            | |
| Unsafe / dyn type                           | `any`                                                      | Same as TS                                                    | N/A                             | `?`                            | |
| Function top type                           | `Function`                                                 | `(...$ReadOnlyArray<empty>) => mixed`                         | Same as TS                      |                                | |
| Bottom type                                 | `never`                                                    | `empty`                                                       | N/A                             | N/A                            | Added in TS 2.0, previously null/undefined acted like bottom |
| Undefined type                              | `undefined`                                                | `void`                                                        | Same as TS                      | Same as TS                     | |
| Null type                                   | `null`                                                     | Same as TS                                                    | Same as TS                      | Same as TS                     | |
| Inexact object type                         | `{ x: S; y: T; }`                                          | `{x: S, y: T, ...}`                                           | `{x:S, ...}`                    | Same as Flow                   | Flow prefers `,` over `;` but both are accepted as field separators. Hegel has “hard” object types by default, so literal ellipses are needed for “soft” semantics. Closure compiler allows bare keys, which have any type. |
| Exact object type                           | N/A                                                        | `{x: S, y: T}`                                                | `{x: S, y: T}`                  |                                | TS doesn’t have exact object types, but you can encode them https://fettblog.eu/typescript-match-the-exact-object-shape/ Flow plans to deprecate the `{\|\|}` syntax at some point in the future (~1 year), as exact object types are the default now |
| Object type spread                          |                                                            | `type T = {...S}`                                             |                                 |                                | |
| Object top type                             | `object`                                                   | `interface {}`                                                | Object                          | `Object`                       | |
| Interfaces                                  | `interface I { x: S; }`                                    | Same as TS                                                    | N/A (type aliases used instead) | `@interface`                   | In Hegel, type aliases can be used in an implements clause |
| Interface getter/setter                     | `interface I { get p(): number; set p(x : S); }`           | Same as TS (setter return type required by Flow)              | N/A                             |                                | |
| Index signature                             | `{ [key: S] : T }`                                         | Flow does not require `key` name, `{[S]: T}` is valid as well | N/A                             | N/A                            | This syntax is supported in Hegel but appears to be buggy. Index signatures are also allowed in TS inside of class bodies, optionally with a static specifier. |
| Class interface declaration                 | `class Foo implements Bar { ... }`                         | Same as TS                                                    | Same as TS                      | `@implements {ClassName}`      | Hegel implements from type aliases |
| Override declaration                        | `class C extends D { override m() { … } }`                 | N/A                                                           | N/A                             | `@override`                    | Added in TS 4.3. |
| Abstract class                              | `abstract class C { abstract m() : S; }`                   | N/A                                                           | N/A                             | `@abstract`                    | |

| Call signature                              | `{ (x: S, ...): T; ... }`                                  | `{ (S ...): T, ... }`                                         | N/A                             |                                | Hegel parses the Flow syntax but it appears to be buggy. |
| Constructor signature                       | `{ new (x: S): T; } or new (x: S) => T`                    | N/A                                                           | N/A                             |                                | Flow will understand the first TS example type, but interpret it as a property “new” with a function type. |
| Cast                                        | `<T>expr` or `expr as T`                                   | Same as TS                                                    | N/A                             | `/** @type {!T} */ (expr)`     | For Flow see [v0.219.0 release notes](https://github.com/facebook/flow/releases/tag/v0.219.0) |
| Assertion (cast without change of type)     | `expr satisfies T`                                         | N/A                                                           | N/A                             |                                | Added in TS 4.9. Flow parses for error reporting purposes. |

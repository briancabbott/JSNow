## Royalty Free Status

Royalty free contribution... seems obvious


## Internationalization







Questions:

  1. How will spec compliance be enforced?

    "Best Fit" (Language, Date-Time Format Negotiation)

      - Browser A vs. Browser B, what is a best fit?

      There are tests, but things being "unspecified"
      are not good for the web.

      This will give birth to unpredictability which
      in turn forces web developers to shim the
      "predictability".



TODO:

  1. Re-review Internationalization "poke holes"
  2. Section 13 DateTimeFormat Objects




* Web Developers simply have to get better at writing flexible app
  code with better data decoupling practices

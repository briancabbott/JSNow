## Welcome

JN: (Introductions)

DC: (Logistics)

JN: ...updating status of RFTG
...Adopt agenda?

Unanimous approval

JN: Approval of Sept Minutes?

Unanimous approval

## ES6 Status

AWB: (presenting Luke's spreadsheet with remaining features that need attention)
https://skydrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=704A682DC00D8AAD!59602&app=Excel&authkey=!AAMixsO0TuyPYwc

...Function.prototype.toString still needs attention

BE: Mark is to write spec, in this case under-specify

AWB:
- Refutable pattern matching is deferred
- still need specification for enumerate / getOwnPropertyKeys/Symbols in various places
- Proxy handlers, cut
- C-style for-let

BE: We agreed on semantics

AWB: We agreed on outer capture, but won't try to update per iteration. Need per iteration binding.

YK: This is the consensus I recall

AWB:
- Modules, static semantics complete
- No loader/runtime semantics yet.
- Dave will have a complete spec this meeting

YK: (confirms that it's complete)

AWB: Yes, but not yet in the spec.
- Standard Modules deferred.



(TVC dials in)

## 4.4 Finalizing the Proxy API for ES6
(Presented by Tom Van Cutsem)

TVC: First three relate to es-discuss threads, re: simplifying Proxy. Jason Orendorff expressed concerns.
- hasOwn()
- invoke()

WH:

AWB: Looked for traps for call

BE: Total traps?

AWB: Now 14 traps.

BE: Cool. Not including hasOwn()?

AWB: Not including

TVC: The next is `invoke()` trap. Leave out for now to avoid inconsistencies with `get()`?

YK: How do you implement virtual objects? ie. an object whose `this` object is always the proxy. Can't do it reliably without invoke.

WH: Still not reliable, even with invoke.

YK: So what are the cases?

AWB: Can still implement a virtual object or full membrane, or thin wrapper.

YK: Not the use case. Want to make an object where `this` is the proxy and not the target.

TVC: Are you arguing that `this` should remain bound to the proxy object upon forwarding? If yes, this is the default.

YK: As long as maintaining equivalence between `foo.bar()` and `bar.call(foo)`

AWB: yes.

TVC: Regarding Handler API: not enough motivating use cases for proxy handlers without community use. Propose to defer.

AWB: Let's publish the library code
TVC: It's already on github, as part of my shim. I will publish it as a separate project to make it more accessible.

TVC: `Proxy` as a constructor? Currently, no `new` throws TypeError

AWB: Not really a "class"

AR: You create new ones?

AWB: No prototype

AR: Gives an instance, why not "new"

AWB: Would need an @@create

YK: Then shouldn't be capitalized

BE: We can do "proxy"

AWB: (to Tom) the concern is: if it's not "new-able", should it be little-p proxy?

TVC: Given choice between little-p proxy and requiring `new`, I prefer `new`

RW: Agree with Alex, `new Proxy()` creates new Proxies, so allow `new`

AR: Let's not duck the charge on @@create.

WH: Proxy is not a class.

YK: ...But has allocation

WH: I would hate to specify what happens when subclassing from Proxy

AWB: Must create a special constructor

TVC: @@create doesn't make sense here

BE: Is Proxy a class?

(General: no)

TVC:


DS: What is typeof and instanceof

AWB/BE: object

BE: Capital P

AWB: Ca???

DS: Whatever Proxy creates?

BE: That depends on what is created.

DS: By default?

BE: typeof depends if there is a call trap. instanceof depends on the prototype chain. All in the spec, so can create any object (apart from private state issues)

AWB: Ok, into the future... would value objects allow `new`?

BE: (int64 example)

...back to why should `new` throw on Proxy constructor.

BE: Seems counter intuitive: Proxy constructs objects. `int64` creates a value. callables construct objects

[ inaudible ]

BE: these are object constructor functions, which is what people want to do with "new"

AWB: this is somewhere in the middle between newing a class and a random function that returns an object

BE: in either case, it returns a new object and proxies are factories for object

AWB: yeah, I agree...spec currently calls them "proxy factory functions"

BE: pretty weird not to have "new" on this.. feels natural

YK: Intuitively, the difference between returning an object and not a value

AWB: we can do it...need to make it an exotic object with a special [[Construct]]

AR: agree. Making it exotic is good.

TVC: what's the summary?

AWB: we allow new, we do it by making it exotic.

EA: Do we REQUIRE "new"?

WH: what does Map do without `new`?

EA: Throws

BE: Why are we requiring `new` again?

RW: Needed for subclassing

AWB: my objection is that we're trying to tell a story about objects, classes, and @@create... this confuses the story

YK: there's already a weird split...saying you have to use `new` avoids the confusion

AR/RW: agree

AWB: we could go either way, and it's subtle, but most people won't see the subtlety

RW/BE: the conservative thing to do is to throw now and we can walk it back later

AWB: agree

JM: Removing the throw might change control flows?

BE: non-issue, rare.


#### Consensus/Resolution

- Drop `hasOwn()`
- Drop `invoke()`
- Postpone proxy handlers API
- REQUIRE `new Proxy` by making Proxy an exotic function that has it's own internal construct. (this is only "action" item)


## ES6 Status (cont)

AWB:
    - Symbols in place
    - Binary data deferred
    - RegExp look behind deferred

WH: No comprehensive specification of which variant of RegExp lookbehind was wanted. Followed up on es-discuss and got no good answer to questions.

AWB: No one has stepped up, deferred to ES7
- Completion reform has bugs, but that's just work for me
- Global scope, Dave has some possible changes he wants to discuss at this meeting
- Eval scope, now simplified because can't eval a module
- function scope, needs spec some design issues still open
- Promises, Domenic has a complete delta, just needs to be added
- Internal Method Invariants. If we're going to keep this section, someone needs to provide spec ready text.

MM: If Tom will collaborate with me on this, I will commit to producing this.

AWB: I can live without this section

MM: ES5 had that section, I will talk to Tom about creating this for ES6

...

AWB: For the end of this year, we need a feature complete spec. Essentially a "candidate spec". This means all the features there are sufficiently specified to allow an implementor to implement. I think we have a shot at it. There is work to do. Questions remain in modules, but Dave can update us. Dave and Jason (Orendorff) have been working like crazy to finish modules, including a reference implementation.

MM: The spec we want to be feature complete includes modules?

AWB: Yes.

MM: The loader stuff as well?

AWB: Yes.
... Over the next 6-9 months, we need implementors to work and provide feedback. We should push forward with what he have now (this includes modules)


## 4.1 Review Latest Specification Draft
(Allen Wirfs-Brock)


(request slides)


Discussion re: arguments.caller, arguments.callee in non-strict and strict mode.

Discussion re: default param aliasing

BE: (tries aliasing on SM)

YK: Issues with arguments.caller, arguments.callee in framework uses.

BE: Do we want three types of arguments?

YK: It's not really three types

...

BE: Fair to say there are three observably different kinds of arguments

-

YK:

MM: Adopt some semantics where aliasing

BE: Deep aliasing of destructured parameters is bad

AR: Walk back poisoning entirely?

MM: No.

MM: Any simple parameter is aliased and any new style parameter is not
... on defaults I could go either way.

AWB: Back to scheduling

BE: If there is destructuring, no deep aliasing.

WH: Easier to explain if the rules are compositional.



#### Consensus/Resolution

- Parameter issues
- default params, alias is independent
- destructuring has no name for top level object, no aliasing
- rest has no aliasing
- non-strict mode arguments have unpoisoned caller and callee


... Continue discussion re: do Arrow Functions have an arguments object?

#### 4.3 Should 'arguments' in an arrow body be from nearest outer defining scope, or early error?
(Brendan Eich)

AWB: Arrows don't have an arguments object, but `arguments` is a keyword inside arrow functions.

WH: `let arguments = ...`?

not allowed, recapping ES5 strict rules that were applied to new forms in ES6.

questions about conditionally reserved words

AWB: what if the outer function _does_ say `let arguments = ...;`, what is it in the arrow function?

MM: (whiteboard)

```js
function f() {
  var arguments = 1;

  [3, 2, 1].forEach(v => v + arguments);
}
```

YK: `this`, `super`, `arguments` should refer to its outer.

WH: 11.6.2.2 and 13.2.1.1 are inconsistent. The former omits keywords such as "arguments", while claiming to be based on the latter.

#### Consensus/Resolution
- `arguments` is lexically captured by arrow functions
- 11.6.2.2 and 13.2.1.1 are inconsistent (file a bug)
- yield cannot mean "yield to the outer"


AWB/BE: yield just follows the rules for yield

MM: (whiteboard)

```js
function foo() {
  var yield = 8;
  return function * bar() {
    yield baz();

    function baz() {
      return yield;
    }
  }
}

var f = foo();

console.log(f().next().value);

// 8
```


#### AWB: ...Computed property keys: No dynamic checking for duplicate computed property name in object literals or classes

```js
{
  [expr1]: 1,
  [expr2]: 2
}
// Does not check if expr1 === expr2
```

MM: Cannot statically repeat properties in object literals

AWB: This isn't a static object literal

MM: ...

YK: The most common usage will by for symbols, eg. @@iterator

AWB: We don't have a mechanism for runtime checks like this and shouldn't be adding such checks

MM: The create and overwrite paths are very different (define v. assign)

WH: Pick one or the other. If we're going to do static checking, do it consistently. Either always check or never check

AWB: The complications I ran into were in gets and sets, it's not just "does this property exist"...

BE: We do want computed property gets and sets
...We should do checks.

AWB: It's not that non-strict doesn't check...

MM: given that we do dynamic checks in strict mode, you prefer NOT doing them in sloppy mode?

AWB: I don't like the dynamic checks either way

MM: that wasn't the question

AWB: the precedent in ES5 for object literals is that strict mode has "more" static checks.

AWB: "from a language design perspective", we should have them the same in both cases

BE: I'm w/ WH and ARB, we want the check in strict mode

AWB: so you don't want the check in sloppy mode?

BE: I don't think there is only one consistent position, and I'm ok with no dynamic check in non-strict mode

... discussion of the current static checks in non-strict mode ...

#### Consensus/Resolution

- No change, this is the semantics:

```
var name = "x";
var o = {x:42, x:45}, // static strict error
    o2 = {x:42, get x()}, // static error
    o3 = {x:42, [name]:45 }, // dynamic strict error
    o4 = {x:42, get [name]() {}}; // dynamic error
```

AWB: the consensus is that for dynamically computed property names we will dynamically check the things we would have statically checked.

WH: Pop quiz. What does the following parse as?

```js
baz = ...
function foo() {
  var yield = 8;
  return function * bar() {
    yield
        baz
    yield
        * baz
    yield (baz) => yield * baz
  }
}
```

[Almost nobody guessed all of these right.]

Current answer, with all optional semicolons inserted:
```js
baz = ...
function foo() {
  var yield = 8;
  return function * bar() {
    yield;  // The yield expression rule has a [no LineTerminator here]
        baz;
    yield // The yield * expression rule doesn't. No optional semicolon here!
        * baz;
    yield (baz) => yield * baz; // The * here is a product of two variables
  }
}
```

#### Consensus/Resolution
- Update `yield * [Lexical goal InputElementRegexp]` => `yield [no LineTerminator here] * [Lexical goal InputElementRegexp]`



## Class/optional yield arg ambiguity

```js
function *g() {
  class foo extends yield {} // is that an object or the class body?
  {}
}
```

Proposed solutions:

- Disallow trailing yield in extends clause
- Requires an extra parameter to Expression and AssignmentExpression
- extends LeftHandSideExpression
- would be only place an expression isnt explicitly Expression or AssignmentExpression


BE: (whiteboard)

```js
// Don't want to require these parens:
class C extends (A + B) {

}
```

BE: Should have no trailing yield, as a static error

... lost track here...


WH: (whiteboard) Counterexample to claim about never requiring parentheses in expressions that would be unambiguous without them:
```js
a = b * (yield c)
```


WH: Think of "extends"  as having the same precedence as assignment operators. That's why class C extends (A + B) would require parentheses.


#### Consensus/Resolution

- extends LeftHandSideExpression
- would be only place an expression isnt explicitly Expression or AssignmentExpression


## Cross-Realm Symbol Registration

(need slide)

AWB:

```js
// key is a string
Symbol.for(key) => aSymbol // creates a new Symbol if key is not registered

Symbol.keyFor(aSymbol) => key
```

- Where for all strings S: `Symbol.keyFor(Symbol.for(S)) === S`
- the use case for `Symbol.keyFor` is serialization


Revisiting discussion from last meeting, re: Symbol.

Discussion regarding the value, or lack of, registered Symbols over Strings.

DH: Is it necessary to be `Symbol.keyFor()? What about `Symbol.prototype.key`

DS: Is there direct correspondance between `Symbol` and `toString`?

DH: If the symbol is registered, `toString` does the same as `Symbol.keyFor`

AWB: is this good?

DH: What does `Symbol.keyFor` return if the symbol is unregistered?

undefined

#### Consensus/Resolution

- Agree on proposed API.
- If the symbol is unregistered: `Symbol.keyFor(unregistered symbol)` returns `undefined`
- `Symbol.keyFor(not a symbol)` throws


AWB: An issue about Symbols not being usable as WeakMap keys...
...which is ok...

This lead to discussion about (re)naming of WeakMap. It's possible that WeakMap may be renamed SideTable


## Introduce a Prototype object that contains sloppy arguments object @@iterator function?

Discussion re:
- `arguments` prototype
- `arguments.prototype.constructor`


AWB/MM: instanceof is generally misused

AWB: Current spec: all built-in iterators. Self hostable

MM: Issues are with consistency.

BE: (whiteboard)

```js
Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator] !== (function() {
  return arguments[Symbol.iterator];
})();
```

MM: ...future JS programmers learning classes without understanding prototypes. Let's not unnecessarily introduce new abstractions that can't be understood within these semantics.

(meta discussion)

AWB: (describing a spec that used class inheritance for all new inherited objects, eg. `Array.Iterator`)

BE: Return to the question... should `arguments` be iterable, and how?

AWB/MM: (discussion re:


#### Consensus/Resolution

...?


## Conventions for ignore over-ride of @@iterator

MM: Why is this a spec issue?

AWB: @@iterator is bad example, @@toStringTag is better

BE: Use `undefined`, not "falsey"

AWB: re: `new Map(?, "is")`

BE/RW: `new Map(undefined, "is")` defaults to empty list

AWB: Happy with undefined.

#### Consensus/Resolution

- Just use `undefined`


## (function Foo() {}).bind(x).name?

See: http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:function_name_property

AWB: What about anonymous function expressions?

RW: No name is made

AWB: What about bound anonymous function expressions?

RW: Same, no name.

DS: Could bound functions delegate their name? Do we want to do that?

BE: Might be interesting to find out, can chat with Brandon about this.


#### Consensus/Resolution

- "bind" wins over "bound"
- Brandon needs to review the spec.



## 9 ECMA-404 W3C TAG / TPAC report
(Alex Russell)

AR: (recapping JSON specification leading to 404)
... There are people at the IETF that want more restrictions, eg. a number types, character encoding.

WH/MM: what does that mean?

AWB: Let's avoid doing what they're doing.

AR: They want to restrict all the things, that we're simply not willing to do.
... The draft revision includes non-normative "advice". They've also diverged on what is "valid JSON".

RW: Specifically, they've changed JSON so that JSONValue is not the top level grammar production, using JSONText instead. This means only "{}" and "[]", which is incompatible with Ecma-404.

AR: (proposal to work together)

STH: 3 levels.

1. Bytes on the wire. For example reject UTF-32
2. Sequence of unicode code points that make up a valid JSON sequence. This is covered by ECMA-404.
3. Semantics of this structure. For example, reject numbers with a thousand digits.


#### Consensus/Resolution

- Alex will draft statement to send to IETF last call, due Thursday



## 4.9 Reconsidering Object.is
(Dave Herman)

DH: Object.is might be a mistake

AWB:  Could be trying to fill one of two purposes:
- the finest distinction possible
- what you really wish triple equal was

For general use, you want -0 and +0 to be equated, NaN to equal NaN

MM, WH: Multiple NaNs are not visible in JavaScript

AWB, DH: Different NaNs are distinguishable if aliased via TypedArrays

AWB: Hence Object.is does not discriminate as finely as possible

WH: That would be a mistake. ES1-5 clearly state that the NaN values are indistinguishable, and some implementations rely on that for NaN-boxing. Object.is should consider all NaNs to be the same.

[ discussion ]

AWB: NaNs are technically still not distinguishable in ECMAScript because an implementation has the freedom to write any quiet NaN bit pattern into a TypedArray, not necessarily the one that generated the NaN; in fact, writing the same NaN twice might generate different bit patterns.

Discussion about equating NaN values (https://github.com/rwaldron/tc39-notes/blob/master/es6/2013-01/jan-29.md#conclusionresolution)

MM: The spec allows 0/0 to be written to a TypedArray twice with different actual bit pattern.

More discussion re: IEEE NaN

#### Consensus/Resolution

- Status Quo

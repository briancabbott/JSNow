        A step in the algorithms below that is marked "With atomic access to ..." is known as an atomic step.  There must be a single total order (shared by all the agents that are able to communicate through shared memory) in which atomic steps occur, known as the atomics order.  If an atomic step R reads some bytes B<sub>0</sub> through B<sub>n</sub> in a SharedArrayBuffer, for each byte B it may return any of:</p>

      <p> There is a relation <em>happens-before</em> on program steps that is defined as follows. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> If a step S precedes a step T in the dynamic semantics of a program within a single agent then S happens-before T.
        <li> If a step S writes a value with an atomic operation synchronizes-with a step T then S happens-before T
        <li> There are certain inter-agent, embedding-specific operations that contribute to the happens-before relationship; see the later section on Web Browser embedding.
      </ul>


      Note, how do the futex sections figure into all of this?

      <p>Notes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Data-race free programs are sequentially consistent.
        <li> The fact that all Atomics accesses occur through SharedTypedArrays instead of SharedDataViews or directly to the SharedArrayBuffer guarantees that accesses will be aligned.
        <li> If two atomic steps access the same elements of a SharedArrayBuffer through SharedTypedArrays with different element sizes, they do not induce a happens-before edge, but they do still occur in the global atomics order.
        <li> Atomic steps do not have to be through the same type SharedTypedArray to induce a happens-before edge.
      </ul>
      
      <p> If the two threads access the same shared memory cells , and at least one access is not an atomic operation
      <p> Atomic accesses to memory are totally ordered. </p>

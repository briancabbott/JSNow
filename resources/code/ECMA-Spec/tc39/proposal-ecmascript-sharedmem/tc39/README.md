spec.html is processed using ecmarkup into shmem.html, which is the
final formatted spec.

ecmarkup is available here: https://github.com/bterlson/ecmarkup.

ecmarkup requires io.js, available here: https://iojs.org/en/index.html.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: The SIMD.js spec was very helpful in formatting the
shared memory spec, see https://github.com/johnmccutchan/ecmascript_simd.

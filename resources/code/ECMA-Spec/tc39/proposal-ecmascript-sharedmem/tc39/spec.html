<p>Some algorithms and semantics in this proposal are presented as modifications to existing ES262 algorithms and semantics.  The base revision of ES262 for the modifications (here denoted "ES7") is currently f35248729043089b47ccf29e4c47559386f5f6fd (2016-06-29).  At the moment, ES7 (ES2016) section numbering differs from ES6 (ES2015) only for TypedArrays (section 22.2).</p>

<emu-intro id="intro">
<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This proposal adds a simple form of shared memory to ECMAScript.
Shared memory is being exposed in the form of a new SharedArrayBuffer
type; the existing TypedArray and DataView types are adapted in such a way
that they can be used to create views on shared memory.  The new
global Atomics object provides atomic operations on shared memory
locations, including operations that can be used to create blocking
synchronization primitives.  Though not a part of this specification,
we intend for the role of "threads" to be played by Web Workers in web
browser environments.<p>

<p>At this time the proposal adds only low-level primitives to
ECMAScript; we expect the developer community to put together
abstractions that are useful in specific domains.</p>

<p>The work has been driven by the following use cases: <p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for threaded code in programs written in other
  languages that are translated to asm.js or plain JS or a combination
  of the two, notably C and C++ but also other, safe, languages.

  <li>Support for hand-written JS or JS+asm.js that makes use of
  multiprocessing facilities for select tasks, such as image
  processing, asset management, or game AI.
</ul>

<p>The proposal makes only very basic assumptions about the required
hardware and should be broadly implementable with good performance.
Prototype implementations of the API are available in Firefox and in
Google Chrome.</p>

<p>This specification constitutes a restatement and formalization of
an earlier
work, <a href="https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript_sharedmem/blob/master/historical/Spec_JavaScriptSharedMemoryAtomicsandLocks.pdf">the
spec document for which</a> also contains additional rationale,
background information, discussions, implementation notes, and
comments.</p>

  <li>2016-07-05 -- Rephrased the wait/wake mutual exclusion in terms of critical sections named by (G,i), as the old specification was too strong.
  <li>2016-06-30 -- Algorithms that are modified relative to their ES262 forms include more context and are more clearly marked, and there's a defined ES262 base revision for those modifications.  Updated section references to reference that revision.
  <li>(Older changelog removed)

      <p>Insert the following paragraphs after the third:</p>

      <p>A data block that resides in memory that can be referenced from multiple agents concurrently is designated a <dfn>Shared Data Block</dfn>.  A Shared Data Block has an identity (for the purposes of equality testing Shared Data Block values) that is <em>address-free</em>: it is tied not to the virtual addresses the block is mapped to in any process, but to the set of locations in memory that the block represents.  Shared Data Blocks can also be distinguished from Data Blocks.</p>

      <p>The semantics of Shared Data Blocks is defined using Shared Data Block events by the Atomics memory model. Abstract operations below introduce Shared Data Block events and act as the interface between evaluation semantics and the event semantics of the memory model. The events form a candidate execution, on which the memory model acts as a filter. Please consult the memory model for full semantics.</p>

      <p>Shared Data Block events are modeled by Records, defined in the Atomics memory model. All agents in an agent cluster share the same candidate execution record in its Agent Record's [[CandidateExecution] field, which is initialized to an empty candidate execution Record.</p>

      <emu-note>
        <p>One may think of the evaluation semantics of ECMAScript as a generating function for candidate executions. The memory model then prunes invalid executions from the set of candidate executions. A single-agent ECMAScript program that does not use SharedArrayBuffer (and, for simplicity, ignoring other sources of nondeterminism such as `Math.random()`) always has exactly one candidate execution, which is also a valid execution. A multi-agent ECMAScript program that uses SharedArrayBuffer has many candidate executions and at least one valid execution.</p>

    <p>Once the values of [[Signifier]], [[IsLockFree1]], and

    cluster they cannot change.</p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>The values of [[IsLockFree1]] and [[IsLockFree2]] are not
        necessarily determined by the hardware, but may also reflect
        implementation choices that can vary over time and between
        ECMAScript implementations.</p>

      <p>There is no [[IsLockFree4]] property: 4-byte atomic
        operations are always lock-free.</p>

      <p>Formally, atomic operations are lock-free if, infinitely
        often, some atomic operation finishes in a finite number of
        program steps.  In practice, if an atomic operation is
        implemented with any type of lock the operation is not
        lock-free.  Lock-free does not imply wait-free: there is no
        upper bound on how many machine steps may be required to
        complete a lock-free atomic operation.</p>

      <p>That an atomic access of size <em>n</em> is lock-free does
        not imply anything about the (perceived) atomicity of
        non-atomic accesses of size <em>n</em>, specifically,
        non-atomic accesses may still be performed as a sequence of
        several separate memory accesses.  See ReadSharedMemory and
        WriteSharedMemory for details.</p>
    </emu-note>

  <emu-clause id="ExecutableCodeAndContexts.AgentCluster">
    <h1>Agent Clusters (NEW)</h1>

    <p>An <em>agent cluster</em> is a maximal set of agents that can
      communicate by operating on shared memory.</p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>Programs within different agents may share memory by
        unspecified means.  At a minimum, the backing memory for
        SharedArrayBuffer objects can be shared among the agents in
        the cluster.</p>

      <p>There may be agents that can communicate by message passing
	that cannot share memory; they are never in the same
	cluster.</p>
    </emu-note>

    <p>Every agent belongs to exactly one agent cluster.</p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>The agents in a cluster need not all be alive at some
	particular point in time.  If agent <b>A</b> creates another
	agent <b>B</b>, after which <b>A</b> terminates and <b>B</b>
	creates agent <b>C</b>, the three agents are in the same
	cluster if <b>A</b> could share some memory with <b>B</b>
	and <b>B</b> could share some memory with <b>C</b>.</p>
    </emu-note>

    <p>All agents within a cluster must have the same value for
      the [[LittleEndian]] property in their respective Agent Records.</p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>If different agents within an agent cluster have different
        values of [[LittleEndian]] it becomes hard to use shared
        memory for multi-byte data.</p>
    </emu-note>

    <p>All agents within a cluster must have the same values for
      the [[IsLockFree1]] property in their respective Agent Records; similarly for
      the [[IsLockFree2]] property.</p>

    <p>All agents within a cluster must have the same value for the [[CandidateExecution]] in their respective Agent Records.</p>

    <p>All agents within a cluster must have different values for
      the [[Signifier]] property in their respective Agent Records.</p>

    <p>An agent cluster is a specification mechanism and need not correspond to
      any particular artefact of an ECMAScript implementation.</p>

    <p>An embedding may deactivate (stop forward progress) or
      activate (resume forward progress) an agent without the agent's
      knowledge or cooperation.  If the embedding does so, it must not
      leave some agents in the cluster active while other agents in
      the cluster are deactivated indefinitely.</p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>The purpose of the preceding restriction is to avoid a
        situation where an agent deadlocks or starves because another
        agent has been suspended.  For example, if a DOM SharedWorker
        shares memory with a regular worker, and the regular worker is
        suspended while it holds a lock (because the web page the
        regular worker is in is pushed into the window history), and
        the SharedWorker tries to acquire the lock, then the
        SharedWorker will be blocked until the regular worker wakes up
        again, if ever.  Meanwhile other workers trying to access the
        SharedWorker from other web pages will starve.</p>

      <p>The implication of the restriction is that it will not be
        possible to share memory between agents that don't belong to
        the same suspend/wake collective within the embedding.</p>
    </emu-note>

    <p>An embedding may terminate an agent without any of the agent's
      cluster's other agents' prior knowledge or cooperation.  If an
      agent is terminated not by programmatic action of its own or of
      another agent in the cluster but by forces external to the
      cluster, then the embedding must choose one of two strategies:
      Either terminate all the agents in the cluster, or provide
      reliable APIs that allow the agents in the cluster to coordinate
      so that at least one remaining member of the cluster will be
      able to detect the termination, with the termination data
      containing enough information to identify the agent that was
      terminated.</p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>Examples of that type of termination are: operating systems
        or users terminating agents that are running in separate
        processes; the embedding itself terminating an agent that is
        running in-process with the other agents when per-agent
        resource accounting indicates that the agent is runaway.</p>
    </emu-note>

    <emu-note>
      <p>This proposal additionally suggests (see later text) that if
        termination is signaled then the signal creates a
        synchronizes-with edge in the memory ordering.</p>

  <emu-clause id="MemoryModel">
    <h1>Memory Model</h1>

    <emu-note>
      <p>(Spec draft notes)</p>
      <h2>What We Talk About When We Talk About Atomicity</h2>
      <p>Atomicity means two things. One, it means that an action is indivisible. For example, writing a value to memory should write the whole value all at once. This is called access atomicity. Two, it means the timing with which different threads can observe a memory access, i.e., the ordering of memory events. For example, on x86, a memory write becomes visible to all cores other than the writing core at exactly the same time. On ARM, a memory write may become visible to other cores at different times. This is called copy atomicity.</p>

      <p>Access atomicity is the easier problem. Hardware provides access atomic instructions that provide the guarantee. Copy atomicity is more difficult. Memory models concern themselves with prescribing some flavor of copy atomicity by ordering memory events. Access atomicity may be thought of as an orthogonal property that is applied on top of the memory model.</p>

      <h2>Intuitions for the Memory Model</h2>
      <p>The memory model proper is a set of relational constraints on a set of memory events. The memory events correspond to read, write, and read-modify-write operations. The usual, intuitive semantic model of programs is operational: a program's meaning is the steps it takes and what each step does, in algorithmic fashion. ECMA262, excluding this section, is specified operationally. The memory model, in contrast, corresponds is a set of axiomatic constraints that must be satisfied: a program's meaning is mathematical objects that satisfy those constraints. Instead of constructing an algorithm that builds up the possible memory values, the model describes the set of all possible allowed memory values of a program directly via relational constraints.</p>

      <p>Thought of another way, the operational model of ECMA262 constructs an execution that is correct by construction. The memory model instead is a filter on <em>all</em> executions. Some of those executions may not be correct, and the correct ones are exactly the ones that are allowed by the memory model.</p>

      <p>The model is best understood in two parts: the axiomatic part and the interfacing with the rest of ECMA262.</p>

      <p>The axiomatic part is a weak consistency model. It needs to be flexible enough to allow a set of astonishing observable behaviors that are exhibited on weak hardware like ARM and Power and result from compiler transformations. For example, in certain cases, causality is allowed to be violated. At the same time, the memory model needs to enable programmers to reason about programs. These two needs run counter to each other. The compromise in the community is a guarantee called Sequential Consistency for Data Race Free Programs, or SC-DRF. In informal terms, SC-DRF says that if a program does not have concurrent, non-atomic memory accesses on the same memory locations (no data races), the program semantics is as if it were an interleaving of steps from each individual thread (sequentially consistent). The first goal of this model is to enable SC-DRF reasoning. For non-data race free programs, the memory model aims to give unambiguous meaning to those data races. The second goal of this model is to fully specify the semantics of data races.</p>

      <p>To understand the axiomatic model, we start with the input to the model, candidate executions. Assume that there is a set of shared memory events (reads and writes) that correspond to some evaluation of a program. The evaluation gives an initial partial ordering of these events called agent-order: if an event _E_ was evaluated before _D_ in some thread, then _E_ must come before _D_ in agent-order. Along with the set of events and agent-order is a map from read events to write events called reads-from. This map says which reads read from which writes during the evaluation. These three things make up a candidate execution, which is the input to the model. The model's job is to further order those events in such a way that candidate executions that can be observed on actual hardware are deemed valid, i.e., allowed, and executions that cannot be observed are deemed invalid, i.e. disallowed.</p>

      <p>The partial order agent-order only orders events from the same thread. From this order we will build a new partial order called happens-before, which additionally relates pairs of correctly synchronized events across threads. To build happens-before, we start by relating atomic reads that reads-from atomic writes on the same memory location. These pairs are considered correctly synchronized. The happens-before partial order then includes all pairs from agent-order and synchronizes-with, as well as pairs of events that are transitively related. Data races, then, are precisely the events that are not relatable by happens-before, where one of them is a write, and access the same location.</p>

      <p>The SharedArrayBuffer API raises the difficulty that it allows aliased access on the same memory location via different sizes. That is, a read event can reads-from multiple write events, resulting in reading a composite value of bytes written by multiple events. Problematically, hardware often cannot guarantee the atomicity of concurrent accesses that happen on overlapping locations. To this end the model only guarantees atomic reads and writes on exactly the same memory range to be synchronized. Atomic reads and writes on overlapping locations may behave as if they were non-atomic. The memory model fully specifies the possible composite values that may be read. Together with the definition of data races, we have a fully defined semantics for data races.</p>

      <p>In addition to happens-before, we need one last constraint on synchronized atomics to enable SC-DRF reasoning. Recall that sequential consistency is an interleaving. Mathematically, this is equivalent to putting events in a strict total order (i.e., a sequence). Thus the model requires that valid executions have a strict total ordering of correctly synchronized atomic events called memory-order.</p>

      <p>These relations and orders mutually constrain each other so that they are coherent. The coherence constraints roughly correspond to the intuition that a read event cannot read from a write event that's "too old", in the sense that there's another write event on the memory location that happens-after the write event that was read from.</p>

      <p>Putting all of these together nets us a decision procedure that can decide if a candidate execution is valid or not.</p>

      <p>The decision procedure alone is not yet enough. How does a set of memory events arise in the first place? How do we connect this decision procedure, which acts on all possible executions, with the evaluation semantics of ECMA262?</p>

      <p>To connect the axiomatic semantics to the operational semantics, the operational semantics are made nondeterministic. Instead of constructing a single, valid execution, the nondeterministic operational semantics constructs <em>all</em> candidate executions. This is captured by GetValueFromBuffer returning any possible byte value when operating on SharedArrayBuffers. It bears stressing that this is the stuff of semantics and not actual implementations. Implementations will simply return the value that the corresponding hardware load instruction returns. But the hardware, the compiler, or both, may act astonishingly due to the sophistication of their implementation and seemingly read values from e.g., the future, or a branch not taken. One may think of this nondeterminism as treating the reads on shared memory as black boxes (e.g., an opaque cache interface on a CPU). Up front, it reads <em>something</em>, the exact value of which is unknown until later, when we apply the memory model decision procedure.</p>

      <p>With this nondeterminism the evaluation semantics can accumulate events as a side effect of performing operations on SharedArrayBuffers. Events and nondeterministically chosen values are accumulated in the [[EventLists]] and [[ChosenValues]] fields in a candidate execution record during SetValueInBuffer. The model then validates that the chosen values were not completely bogus in addition to all the constraints described above. It bears restressing that this reified candidate execution record and validation are purely formal mechanisms. Implementations will simply return what is read by hardware.</p>

      <p>So what we talk about when we talk about the meaning of a program that uses SharedArrayBuffer is the <em>set</em> of valid executions. To wit, the evaluation semantics first generates the set of all possible candidate executions, then the memory model filters out the invalid ones. The remaining executions is the meaning of the program. A program always has at least one valid execution.</p>
    </emu-note>

    <p>The memory consistency model, or memory model, specifies the possible orderings of Shared Data Block events, arising via accessing TypedArray instances backed by a SharedArrayBuffer and via methods on the Atomics object. When the program has no data races (defined below), the ordering of events appears as sequentially consistent, i.e., as an interleaving of actions from each agent. When the program has data races, shared memory operations may appear sequentially inconsistent. For example, programs may exhibit causality-violating behavior and other astonishments. These astonishments arise from compiler transforms and the design of CPUs (e.g., out-of-order execution and speculation). The memory model defines both the precise conditions under which a program exhibits sequentially consistent behavior as well as the possible values read from data races. To wit, there is no undefined behavior.</p>

    <p>The memory model is defined as relational constraints on events introduced by abstract operations on SharedArrayBuffer or by methods on the Atomics object during an evaluation.</p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>This section provides an axiomatic model on events introduced by the abstract operations on SharedArrayBuffers. It bears stressing that the model is not expressible algorithmically, unlike the rest of this specification. The nondeterministic introduction of events by abstract operations is the interface between the operational semantics of ECMAScript evaluation and the axiomatic semantics of the memory model. The semantics of these events is defined by considering graphs of all events in an evaluation. These are neither Static Semantics nor Runtime Semantics. There is no demonstrated algorithmic implementation, but instead a set of constraints that determine if a particular event graph is allowed or disallowed.</p>

      <h1>The Set and Relation Specification Types</h1>
      <p>The <dfn>Set</dfn> type is used to explain a collection of unordered elements. Values of the Set type are simple collections of elements, where no element appears more than once. Elements may be added to and removed from Sets. Sets may be unioned, intersected, or subtracted from each other.</p>
      <p>The <dfn>Relation</dfn> type is used to explain constraints on Sets. Values of the Relation type are Sets of ordered pairs of values from its value domain. For example, a Relation on events is a set of ordered pairs of events. For a Relation _R_ and two values _a_ and _b_ in the value domain of _R_, _a_ _R_ _b_ is shorthand for saying the ordered pair (_a_, _b_) is a member of _R_. A Relation is least with respect to some conditions when it is the smallest Relation that satisfies those conditions.</p>

      <p>All programs have at least one valid execution.</p>

      <emu-note>
        <p>(Spec draft notes)</p>

        <p>The intuition that the set of valid executions for any ECMAScript program is nonempty owes to that a sequentially consistent (i.e., interleaving) execution may always be demonstrated. Clearly, this valid execution is too strong and insufficient to account for all observable behaviors in implementations. Instead, it serves as an existence proof that the memory model is well defined for ECMAScript. Below is an informal sketch of how to construct a sequentially consistent execution. This sketch spells out the naive intuition programmers often apply to multithreaded programs by imagining them sequentially consistent.</p>

        <p>The idea is to build an interleaving of events, a strict total order called cluster-order, that is consistent with, but strictly stronger than, agent-order. This cluster-order is usable as an agent-order, and from it the additional relations required for a valid execution are constructible. These additional relations are also stronger than what the model requires. Moreover, constraints such as sequentially consistent atomics also hold by construction. This then demonstrates that an interleaving of events will always result in a valid execution.</p>

        <p>The inputs to the memory model from the evaluation semantics are per-agent agent-orders of events in a candidate execution's [[EventLists]] and the nondeterministically chosen values in [[ChosenValues]]. Given each agent's own strict total orders in [[EventLists]], let cluster-order be a strict total order that is consistent with the strict total orders of all agents. This cluster-order may be constructed by "zipping" events from each agent's order or simply by appending (i.e. thread inlining). Additionally, all `"Init"` events introduced by CreateSharedByteDataBlock must be made to precede all non-`"Init"` events in cluster-order. For example, if Agent 1 has events [A, B] and Agent 2 has events [C, D], cluster-order can be [A, C, B, D], or [C, A, D, B], or [A, B, C, D], and so forth. It, however, cannot be [D, C, A, B], as that would be inconsistent with Agent 2's strict total order of its own events.</p>

        <p>Note that there are caveats to the construction of cluster-order we gloss over in this sketch. It is not the case that all possible strict total orders for each agent's own strict total orders in [[EventLists]] give rise to valid executions. For example, if an agent's local order of events assumes certain control dependences on shared memory nondeterminism (e.g., assuming a call to Atomics.wait completed), then cluster-order must order events in such a way that the value depended upon was read. If such a cluster-order does not exist, the construction procedure can start over with different orders in [[EventLists]]. The control dependence nondeterminism introduced by shared memory reads may be explored until a valid execution is found. Note that an execution may be undesirable in reality, such as a deadlock, but still be valid with respect to the memory model.</p>

        <p>With this cluster-order, a valid reads-bytes-from relation is constructible as follows. For each read event _R_, for each of its byte locations _b_, choose the most recent, i.e., supremum, write event _W_ that writes to _b_ in cluster-order for _R_ to reads-bytes-from _W_ for the byte at location _b_. Since all byte locations have at least one write event for it, the `"Init"`, such a _W_ always exists. This reads-bytes-from relation then induces reads-from pointwise.</p>

        <p>With this reads-from relation, synchronizes-with is constructible using the constraints given in the memory model. `"SeqCst"` reads that happen to read from `"SeqCst"` writes on equal ranges are synchronizes-with. For host-specific events disjoint from the shared memory events, the memory model stipulates that the host provides a strict partial order host-synchronizes-with that relates those events. Thus, our constructed synchronizes-with relation is a strict partial order.</p>

        <p>Next, happens-before is constructed by taking the transitive closure of the union of synchronizes-with and reads-from. Since the constructed reads-from and synchronizes-with relations are strict partial orders, happens-before is also a strict partial order.</p>

        <p>Thus far, we have shown how to construct the needed relations. They must now be checked to satisfy the constraints the model sets out for them: valid chosen reads, coherent reads, tear free reads, and sequentially consistent atomics.</p>

        <p>Valid chosen reads may be assumed to be satisfied, as it is a formal mechanism to interface the axiomatic memory model to evaluation semantics. Put another way, the evaluation semantics introduces nondeterministic read events and both deterministic and nondeterministic write events. Some writes into SharedArrayBuffers, for example, depends solely on intra-agent evaluation and are deterministic. Since the evaluation semantics were given the affordance to read any possible byte value from SharedArrayBuffers, we may simply construct the candidate execution's [[ChosenReads]] map to be the "right" values for the constructed cluster-order.</p>

        <p>Coherent reads is satisfied by the construction of reads-bytes-from. Since reads always choose the most recent writes for each byte in cluster-order, which is a strict total order, this is trivially satisfied.</p>

        <p>Tear free reads is satisfied by construction of reads-bytes-from. Since reads always choose the most recent writes for each byte in cluster-order, it is impossible for a [[NoTear]] read to reads-from two different write events with equal range for different bytes. Since cluster-order is total, only one of the events would have been chosen during the construction of reads-bytes-from.</p>

        <p>This execution has sequentially consistent atomics because cluster-order is a strict total order. All memory events are sequentially consistent, so the `"SeqCst"` events must also be sequentially consistent. In other words, cluster-order is the memory-order.</p>

        <p>This concludes the sketch: the constructed execution is valid.</p>

    <emu-clause id="MemoryModel.AccessAtomicity">
      <h1>Access Atomicity (informative)</h1>

      <p>In an execution, a ReadSharedMemory or ReadModifyWriteSharedMemory event is access atomic when it reads-from a single WriteSharedMemory event or ReadModifyWriteSharedMemory event. In the memory model, write events have no force beyond being read from by read events and thus have no notion of being access atomic. This differs from the colloquial notion of access atomicity, which usually means if a write or read was performed by hardware in a single indivisible step.</p>

      <p>The Tear Free Reads requirement does not guarantee access atomicity for non-atomic events. Consider the following program where `U8` and `U16` are aliased 1-byte and 2-byte views on the same Shared Data Block and `a` and `b` represent the same memory address (scaled appropriately for the data type).</p>

      <pre>   W1: U16[a] = 1; W2: U8[b] = 2;
|| W3: U16[a] = 3;
||  R: observe(U16[a]);</pre>

      <p>A candidate execution where all the following hold is a valid execution.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>`R` reads-from `W1`</li>
        <li>`R` reads-from `W2`</li>
      </ul>

      <p>`R` reads a value composed of bytes from `W1` and `W2`, and is thus not access atomic. At the same time, it does not read-from both `W2` and `W3`, and thus is tear free.</p>

      <p>Similarly, neither the synchronizes-with relation nor the Sequentially Consistent Atomics requirement guarantees access atomicity for atomic events. Both are concerned with ordering of atomic operations on equal ranges, but it is possible to have sequentially consistent equal-ranged atomics without access atomicity. For example, consider the following program where `U8` and `U16` are aliased 1-byte and 2-byte views on the same Shared Data Block. Operations giving rise to events are labled; || denotes agent boundary.</p>

      <pre>   W1: Atomics.store(U16, a, 1); W2: Atomics.store(U8, b, 2);
|| W3: Atomics.store(U16, a, 3);
||  R: observe(Atomics.load(U16, a));</pre>

      <p>A candidate execution where all of the following hold is a valid execution.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>`R` synchronizes-with `W1`</li>
        <li>`R` reads-from `W1`</li>
        <li>`R` reads-from `W2`</li>
        <li>`W1` is memory-order before `W2` and `W2` is memory-order before `R` and `R` is memory-order before `W3`</li>
      </ul>

      <p>`W2` is allowed to come between `W1` and `R` in memory-order because it and `R` do not have equal ranges. Thus, `R` may read a value composed of bytes written by both `W1` and `W2`.</p>

      <p>Finally, data race freedom and sequential consistency do not imply access atomicity. Consider the following program with a single agent.</p>

      <pre>W1: Atomics.store(U16, a, 1); W2: Atomics.store(U8, b, 2); R: observe(Atomics.load(U16, a));</pre>

      <p>The only valid execution is as follows.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>`R` synchronizes-with `W1`</li>
        <li>`R` reads-from `W1`</li>
        <li>`R` reads-from `W2`</li>

        <p>Atomics.isLockFree() is an optimization primitive.  The

          `or`, `xor`, or `exchange`) on a datum of size _n_ bytes
          will be performed without the calling agent acquiring a lock
          outside the _n_ bytes comprising the datum, then
          Atomics.isLockFree(_n_) will return *true*.
          High-performance algorithms will use Atomics.isLockFree to
          determine whether to use locks or atomic operations in
          critical sections.  If an atomic primitive is not lock-free
          then it is often more efficient for an algorithm to provide
          its own locking.</p>

        <p>Atomics.isLockFree(4) always returns *true* as that can be
          supported on all known relevant hardware.  Being able to

    <h1>Programmer Guidelines</h1>

    <p>Keep programs data race free, i.e., make it so that it is impossible for there to be concurrent non-atomic operations on the same memory location. Data race free programs have interleaving semantics where each step in the evaluation semantics of each agent are interleaved with each other. For data race free programs, it is not necessary to understand the details of the memory model. The details are unlikely to build intuition that will help one to better write JavaScript.</p>

    <p>More generally, even if a program is not data race free it may have predictable behavior, so long as atomic operations are not involved in any data races and the operations that race all have the same access size.  The simplest way to arrange for atomics not to be involved in races is to ensure that different memory cells are used by atomic and non-atomic operations and that atomic accesses of different sizes are not used to access the same cells at the same time.  Effectively, the program should treat shared memory as strongly typed as much as possible.  One still cannot depend on the ordering and timing of non-atomic accesses that race, but if memory is treated as strongly typed the racing accesses will not "tear" (bits of their values will not be mixed).</p>

  <emu-clause id="CompilerTransforms">
    <h1>Compiler Transformation Guidelines</h1>

    <emu-note>
      <p>(Spec draft notes)</p>

      <p>The memory model provides precise semantics for shared memory events, but it does without fixing its various relations. It prescribes what memory values may be observed for each event, but does not require, e.g., agent-order, to be fixed. Indeed, transformations performed by the ECMAScript implementation or hardware may change agent-order and the other relations. Consider a single agent running in isolation. In the single-agent case, all semantics-preserving transformations are allowed, but, being semantics-preserving, they are not observable to the agent. To contrast, in the multi-agent case, those same transformations may become observable by other agents via shared memory accesses.</p>

      <p>The question arises as to which transformations that are allowed in a multi-agent setting, where transformations that affect shared memory writes are observable by other agents. An agent that writes 0 to `x` and then writes 1 to `y` can be transformed in a single-agent setting to one that writes 1 to `y` and then writes 0 to `x`. But is that a legal transformation if those variables are in shared memory and another agent might observe the order of writes? The transformation would affect the agent-order locally and the happens-before relation globally. And does the answer depend on whether `x` and `y` are written with `"SeqCst"` operations or not?</p>

      <p>It is desirable to allow most program transformations that are valid in a single-agent setting in a multi-agent setting, to ensure that the performance of each agent in a multi-agent program is as good as it would be in a single-agent setting. (There seems to be broad agreement in the programming language design community that that is the right trade-off.)  But "most" does not mean "all". In the example above, if `x` or `y` (or both) were intended to be `"SeqCst"` writes, and the writes were reordered, not only might happens-before be affected, but also synchronizes-with and memory-order, and a program that before transformations was data-race-free and sequentially consistent might no longer be so. In contrast, if `x` and `y` were both `"Unordered"` then in a data-race-free program the change in write order would not be observable at all.</p>

      <p>Frequently these transformations are hard to judge. Can an `"Unordered"` load be moved out of a loop? Even if the loop's termination condition depends on the loaded value? The load is necessarily racy, and the memory model gives some meaning to races; can we depend on that meaning here?</p>

      <p>With that background, we outline some rules about program transformations that are intended to be taken as normative (in that they fall out of the memory model) but which are likely not exhaustive. These rules are intended to apply to program transformations that precede the introductions of the events that make up the agent-order.</p>
    </emu-note>

    <p>Let an <dfn>agent-order slice</dfn> be the subset of the agent-order pertaining to a single agent.</p>
    <p>Let <dfn>possible read values</dfn> of a read event be the set of all values of ValueOfReadEvent for that event across all valid executions.</p>

    <p>Any transformation of an agent-order slice that is valid in the absence of shared memory is valid in the presence of shared memory, with the following exceptions.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Atomics are carved in stone</em>: Program transformations must not cause the `"SeqCst"` events in an agent-order slice to be reordered with its `"Unordered"` operations, nor its `"SeqCst"` operations to be reordered with each other, nor may a program transformation remove a `"SeqCst"` operation from the agent-order.
        <p>(In practice, the prohibition on reorderings forces a compiler to assume that every `"SeqCst"` operation is a synchronization and included in the final memory-order, which it would usually have to assume anyway in the absence of inter-agent program analysis. It also forces the compiler to assume that every call where the callee's effects on the memory-order are unknown may contain `"SeqCst"` operations.)</p></li>

      <li><em>Reads must be stable</em>: Any given shared memory read must only observe a single value in an execution.
        <p>(For example, if what is semantically a single read in the program is executed multiple times then the program is subsequently allowed to observe only one of the values read. A transformation known as rematerialization can violate this rule.)</p></li>

      <li><em>Writes must be stable</em>: All observable writes to shared memory must follow from program semantics in an execution.
        <p>(For example, a transformation may not introduce certain observable writes, such as by using read-modify-write operations on a larger location to write a smaller datum, writing a value to memory that the program could not have written, or writing a just-read value back to the location it was read from, if that location could have been overwritten by another agent after the read.)</p></li>

      <li><em>Possible read values must be nonempty</em>: Program transformations cannot cause the possible read values of a shared memory read to become empty.<p>(Counterintuitively, this rule in effect restricts transformations on writes, because writes have force in memory model insofar as to be read by read events. For example, writes may be moved and coalesced and sometimes reordered between two `"SeqCst"` operations, but the transformation may not remove every write that updates a location; some write must be preserved.)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <emu-note>
      <p>(Spec draft note) These rules are technically stronger than what the memory model implies. For example, for the <em>atomics are carved in stone</em> rule, the memory model only implies that `"SeqCst"` events that synchronizes-with other events be totally ordered. In practice, compilers cannot perform inter-agent program analysis and must assume every atomic call gives rise to `"SeqCst"` events that synchronizes-with other events.</p>
    </emu-note>

    <p>The rules apply only to shared memory accesses, so an implementation that knows the program is not accessing shared memory will not be affected by them.  In practice, the optimizations that are affected by the rules are of limited value, and a practical implementation could avoid those optimizations even for non-shared memory without significant impact.</p>

    <p>Examples of transformations that remain valid are: merging multiple non-atomic reads from the same location, reordering non-atomic reads, introducing speculative non-atomic reads, merging multiple non-atomic writes to the same location, reordering non-atomic writes to different locations, and hoisting non-atomic reads out of loops even if that affects termination. Note in general that aliased TypedArrays make it hard to prove that locations are different.</p>
  </emu-clause>

  <emu-clause id="Codegen">
    <h1>Code Generation Guidelines</h1>

    <p>For architectures with memory models no weaker than those of ARM or Power, non-atomic stores and loads may be compiled to bare stores and loads on the target architecture. Atomic stores and loads may be compiled down to instructions that guarantee sequential consistency. If no such instructions exist, memory barriers are to be employed, such as placing barriers on both sides of a bare store or load. Read-modify-write operations may be compiled to read-modify-write instructions on the target architectrue, such as `LOCK`-prefixed instructions on x86, load-exclusive/store-exclusive instructions on ARM, and load-link/store-conditional instructions on Power.</p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>(Spec draft notes)</p>

      <p>While the memory model is prescriptive by nature, it is intended to allow obvious code generation. Non-atomic accesses are intended to map to bare stores and loads and atomic accesses to the obvious instructions on the underlying hardware. The intention is thus descriptive; the model must allow enough executions such that the astonishing effects that bare stores and loads on hardware with weak memory models exhibit are not prohibited. If an obvious code generation strategy is found to be non-compliant, the bug is likely in the memory model and not the implementation.</p>

      <p>Specifically, the memory model is intended to allow code generation as follows.  There are some ground rules:</p>

      <ul>
        <li> Every atomic operation in the program is assumed to be necessary.
        <li> Atomic operations are never rearranged with each other or with non-atomic operations.
        <li> Functions are always assumed to perform atomic operations.
        <li> Atomic operations are never implemented as read-modify-write operations on larger data, but as non-lock-free atomics if the platform does not have atomic operations of the appropriate size.  (We already assume that every platform has normal memory access operations of every interesting size.)
      </ul>

      <p> With that in mind, naive code generation uses these patterns:</p>

      <ul>
        <li> Regular loads and stores compile to single load and store instructions.
        <li> Lock-free atomic loads and stores compile to a full (sequentially consistent) fence, a regular load or store, and a full fence.
        <li> Lock-free atomic read-modify-write accesses compile to a full fence, an atomic read-modify-write instruction sequence, and a full fence.
        <li> Non-lock-free atomics compile to a spinlock acquire, a full fence, a series of non-atomic load and store instructions, a full fence, and a spinlock release.
      </ul>

      <p>That mapping is correct so long as an atomic operation on an address range does not race with a non-atomic write or with an atomic operation of different size.  However, that is all we need: the memory model effectively demotes the atomic operations involved in a race to non-atomic status.  On the other hand, the naive mapping is quite strong: it allows atomic operations to be used as sequentially consistent fences, which the memory model does not actually guarantee.</p>

      <p>A number of local improvements to those basic patterns are also intended to be legal:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>There are obvious platform-dependent improvements that remove redundant fences.  For example, on x86 the fences around lock-free atomic loads and stores can always be omitted except for the fence following a store, and no fence is needed for lock-free read-modify-write instructions, as these all use LOCK-prefixed instructions.  On many platforms there are fences of several strengths, and weaker fences can be used in certain contexts without destroying sequential consistency.

        <li>Most modern platforms support lock-free atomics for all the data sizes required by ECMAScript atomics.  Should non-lock-free atomics be needed, the fences surrounding the body of the atomic operation can usually be folded into the lock and unlock steps.  The simplest solution for non-lock-free atomics is to have a single lock word per SharedArrayBuffer.

        <li>There are also more complicated platform-dependent local improvements, requiring some code analysis.  For example, two back-to-back fences often have the same effect as a single fence, so if code is generated for two atomic operations in sequence, only a single fence need separate them.  On x86, even a single fence separating atomic stores can be omitted, as the fence following a store is only needed to separate the store from a subsequent load.
      </ul>

      <p>One informative reference about local improvements is <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cpp/cpp0xmappings.html">the writeup from the Cambridge Relaxed Memory Group</a>.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, the restrictions the memory model places on compiler optimizations are less obvious. To this end please consult the Compiler Transformation Guidelines section above, designed to give informal descriptions of restrictions on optimizations that follow from the memory model.</p>

<emu-clause id="WebBrowserEmbedding">
  <h1>Web browser embedding (informative)</h1>

  <p>This section outlines how the Shared Memory and Atomics
    specification fits into the current web ecosystem with the minimum
    amount of change to that ecosystem.  This section is not part of
    the proposal, it is informative only.</p>

  <p>A separate proposal,
    the <a href="https://tc39.github.io/ecmascript_sharedmem/dom_shmem.html">DOM
      companion spec</a>, contains information about changes to the
    DOM APIs and specifications.</p>

  <p>In a web browser an <em>agent</em> is an HTML <em>event
    loop</em> <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-loops">[here]</a>.
    The event loop is realized as either a main thread (which may be
    shared among tabs, as it is in Firefox) or some type of worker
    thread.  The event loops are running jobs in the sense of ES262,
    and the forward-progress requirement of this specification
    (section&nbsp;3.1.1) is generally met as long as each agent has
    its own dedicated operating system thread or shared-thread agents
    can't block.</p>

  <p>Browsers will typically let agents that run on the browser's
    main thread have [[CanBlock]] equal to *false*, to prevent blocking the
    UI and to allow the main thread to do work on behalf of other
    threads.</p>

  <p>Normal ("dedicated") `Worker`s must be supported as agents for
    this proposal to make much sense.</p>

  <p>Memory will be shared among agents by using `postMessage` to
    transmit SharedArrayBuffer objects or TypedArray objects that
    have SharedArrayBuffer buffers; this requires an extension to
    the Structured Clone mechanism.  There is agreement on the general
    syntax and semantics for that extension.</p>

  <p>Agent-to-agent communication extends the synchronizes-with relation
    of the program, as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The call to the `Worker` constructor in the parent
      synchronizes-with the execution of the main script in the worker.

    <li>(Worker termination is not directly observable in current
      browsers, but this is a moot point; see below.)

    <li>A `postMessage` to another agent synchronizes-with the event
      that fires in the agent.
 </ul>

  <p>So long as the browser does not allow a `ServiceWorker` or
    `SharedWorker` ("non-page worker") to share memory with a `Worker`
    it will not violate the suspend/wake cohort rule of this
    specification (section&nbsp;3.3).  The restriction on sharing
    memory can be implemented in the extension to the Structured Clone
    mechanism.  For example, a non-page worker may simply not be
    allowed to receive shared memory (leading to a null value or an
    error signal).  There is not yet any agreement on this point, but
    it is clear that the restriction must be on the receiving side of
    the communication, as the sender may be sending on a `MessagePort`
    that is not yet connected, but may in the future be connected to
    either a valid or invalid recipient.</p>

  <p>At the moment, I believe dedicated workers are in the same
    process as their owning tab in all browsers, so if the process
    crashes then the workers will crash too.  I also don't know any
    reason a browser should forcibly terminate a worker except when a
    tab is closed.  In sum, the termination signaling requirement of
    this specification (section&nbsp;3.3) is probably met by existing
    browsers.</p>

  <p>The web platform should evolve to serve the shared memory use
    case better: by incorporating inspectable worker state and worker
    lifecycle events, and by tightening the wording in the HTML spec
    (currently the browser is allowed to kill a worker at any time for
    any reason, which is not quite what we want).  WebIDL should
    evolve to allow Web APIs to be described as to when they can and
    cannot receive shared memory parameters.  However, only an
    extension to the Structured Clone algorithm is needed to support
    the Shared Memory and Atomics specification in practice on current
    browsers.</p>

<h1>ECMAScript Shared Memory and Atomics - asm.js addenda</h1>
<p> Revised: 2016-01-22 </p>

<emu-intro id="intro">
<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p> This document defines the changes and amendments to asm.js
  semantics to support
  <a href="https://github.com/lars-t-hansen/ecmascript_sharedmem">the proposal for ECMAScript shared memory and atomics</a>.
  Please refer to that document for full information about the semantics. </p>
  
<p>This specification is a restatement of
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19X8Geo_7OMyyUICMvIqzEgSDms0rRMDODdMIkXIm9m0/edit?usp=sharing">an earlier work</a>,
  along with later bug fixes.  The earlier work is obsolete. </p>

<p>Changelog:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 2016-01-22 -- Removed the section on SharedTypedArray in Firefox, that code is gone.
  <li> 2015-11-05 -- Noted that the old SharedTypedArray views are now deprecated for asm.js code in Firefox.
  <li> 2015-08-31 -- Correct return types on atomic operations.  (For load, exchange, compareExchange, add, sub, and, or, and xor the return type is Int, not Signed.  For store it is the type of the _value_ argument, not Signed).  Remove non-throwing behavior on out-of-range accesses; the operations throw, as they do for non-asm.js code.  Move mention of the old SharedTypedArray views to the Firefox section.  Clarify wording throughout.
  <li> 2015-08-28 -- initial translation from the original proposal.
</ul>
</emu-intro>

<emu-clause id="terminology">
  <h1>Terminology</h1>
  <p> An "integer-typed array" is one of the ~TypedArray~ views ~Int8Array~, ~Uint8Array~, ~Int16Array~, ~Uint16Array~, ~Int32Array~, and ~Uint32Array~. </p>

  <p> A "float-typed array" is one of the TypedArray views ~Float32Array~ and ~Float64Array~. </p>
</emu-clause>
    
<emu-clause id="views">
  <h1>Views</h1>

  <p> The heap memory passed to the asm.js module at link time must be
    a ~SharedArrayBuffer~ if and only if the module references the 
    ~Atomics~ object (see below).  If this constraint fails then a
    soft link error ensues and execution falls back to non-asm.js, cf
    the asm.js spec section 7. </p>

</emu-clause>

<emu-clause id="atomics">
  <h1>Atomics</h1>

  <p> There is a new known stdlib object ~Atomics~.  This object
    provides a number of known, static methods, a subset of the
    methods provided in the full specification.  The atomic operations
    have the same dynamic semantics in asm.js as in full JS. </p>
  
  <emu-note>
    <p>The following Atomics names are not available as intrinsics in asm.js:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Atomics.futexWait()
      <li> Atomics.futexWake()
      <li> Atomics.futexWakeOrRequeue()
      <li> Atomics.OK
      <li> Atomics.NOTEQUAL
      <li> Atomics.TIMEDOUT
    </ul>

    <p> The futex methods can be accessed through the FFI (with the
      heap passed implicitly) and the operation result values can be
      expanded into constant values, as they have known values.</p>

  </emu-note>
  
  <emu-clause id="atomics.load">
    <h1>Atomics.load(view, index)</h1>

    <emu-clause id="atomics.load.static">
      <h1>Static constraints</h1>
      
      <p> The _view_ must name an integer-typed array mapped onto
      shared memory. </p>

      <p> The _index_ must be an expression of static type Intish.  If
      the element byte size of _view_ is not 1 then _index_ must have
      the form _C_, where _C_ is a constant, or the form _E>>K_, where
      _E_ is some expression and _K_ is a constant that is the
      log-base-2 of the element byte size of _view_. </p>

      <p> The result type of Atomics.load is Int. </p>

      <emu-note>
	<p> Treating atomic accesses as "syntax" rather than as
	  "calls" -- ie, requiring a shift for the index expression --
	  fits in with how they will be used and allows for
	  simplifictions in code generation. </p>
      </emu-note>

    </emu-clause>

  </emu-clause>

  <emu-clause id="atomics.store">
    <h1> Atomics.store(view, index, value) </h1>
    
    <emu-clause id="atomics.store.static">
      <h1>Static constraints</h1>
      <p> The _view_ and _index_ arguments are constrained as for Atomics.load. </p>

      <p> The _value_ must be an expression of static type Intish. </p>

      <p> The result type of Atomics.store is the actual type of _value_. </p>
    </emu-clause>
    
  </emu-clause>

  <emu-clause id="atomics.exchange">
    <h1> Atomics.exchange(view, index, value) </h1>
    
    <emu-clause id="atomics.exchange.static">
      <h1>Static constraints</h1>
      <p> The _view_, _index_, and _value_ arguments are constrained as for Atomics.store. </p>

      <p> The result type of Atomics.exchange is Int. </p>

    <h1> Atomics.compareExchange(view, index, expected, replacement) </h1>

    <emu-clause id="atomics.compareExchange.static">
      <h1>Static constraints</h1>
      <p> The _view_ and _index_ arguments are constrained as for Atomics.load. </p>

      <p> The _expected_ and _replacement_ arguments must be
      expressions of static type Intish. </p>

      <p> The result type of Atomics.compareExchange is Int. </p>
    </emu-clause>

  </emu-clause>
  
  <emu-clause id="atomics.fence">
    <h1> Atomics.fence() </h1>

    <p> Implements a full memory barrier. </p>

    <emu-note>
      <p> Atomics.fence() is no longer a part of the Shared Memory and
      Atomics specification and we do not expect to reintroduce it.
      It is implemented in Firefox, for now, but will likely be removed. </p>
    </emu-note>

    <emu-clause id="atomics.fence.static">
      <h1>Static constraints</h1>

      <p> The result type of Atomics.fence is void. </p>

    <h1> Atomics.isLockFree(size) </h1>

    <emu-clause id="atomics.isLockFree.static">
      <h1>Static constraints</h1>
      <p> The _size_ argument must be an integer constant. <p>

      <p> The result type of Atomics.isLockFree is Int, a boolean value. </p>

      <emu-note>
	<p> Again, treating Atomics.isLockFree as syntax rather than
	  as a call fits in with how it will be used and provides
	  guarantees that it will be resolved at compile time. </p>

The archived materials come in pairs of files: .odt and .pdf,
reflecting a problem with exporting the content from Google Docs
properly.

The .odt file preserves the comment threads from Google Docs, but it
preserves *all* comment threads, including the closed ones.  This is
not ideal, because most comment threads were closed on most of these
specs.

The .pdf file does not preserve the comment threads.  This is not
ideal, because not all threads were closed.

In general (but possibly not uniformly), the open comment threads were
moved into the repository as open issues when the specs were moved to
github.

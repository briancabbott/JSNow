  <title>Tests whether a ServiceWorker can receive and send shared memory</title>
</head>

<body>

<p> This tests whether a ServiceWorker can receive and send shared
  memory objects.  Whether it should be able to do so depends on the
  embedding. </p>

<p> Output will appear below.  In addition to informational and "OK" lines there are lines about exceptions and errors.  Two forms of output are expected:

<ul>
<li> No lines reading EXCEPTION SEEN and no lines reading ERROR means transmission is allowed and memory is shared properly.
<li> Two lines reading EXCEPTION SEEN and nothing else means transmission is blocked in both directions.
</ul>

<p> For any other type of output, consult the code. </p>

<div id='scrool'></div>

<script>
function msg(s) {
    var d = document.createElement('div');
    d.appendChild(document.createTextNode(s));
    document.getElementById("scrool").appendChild(d);
}
</script>

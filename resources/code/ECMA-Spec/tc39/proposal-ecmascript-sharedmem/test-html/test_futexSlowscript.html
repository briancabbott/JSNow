</head>

<body>

<p> Tests the slow script dialog within a Atomics.wait on the main thread.  This may be Firefox-specific at the moment. </p>

<p> Just load the page, click <button onclick="runTest()">This
Button</button>, and leave the browser alone.  The slow script dialog
should appear after a while.  You should be able to Continue the
script without anything happening except the dialog appearing again
later.  You should be able to Stop the script and have the browser go
back to being its responsive self, without any scary-looking output
appearing below (there will be some output).

<P> Remember to <button onclick="counter=0">Reset the test state</button> beween
each test, when the script is killed
it leaves global status variables in an inconsistent state.

<P> Also check the console, once you kill the script there should be a
stack trace there.

<P> Try these experiments:
<ul>
<li> Click the button several times to see if that provokes nested events (it should not)
<li> Type eg Ctrl-Shift-K to bring up the dev console while the script is waiting to see
     what that does (it should not hang)
</ul>

<P> Additionally you should be able to bring up the script in a debugger by
clicking "Debug script" in the slow-script dialog.  (On my system this causes
one of my cores to stay at 100% utilization.)

<script src="harness.js"></script>

<script>
var mem = new Int32Array(new SharedArrayBuffer(4));
var counter = 0;

function runTest() {
    if (!canBlockOnThisThread) {
        msg("NO TEST: Atomics.wait is disabled (by the browser) on the main thread");
        return;
    }

    msg("Enter, counter=" + counter);
    if (counter > 0)
        msg("Event received while inside Atomics.wait (recursive event delivery), very QUESTIONABLE");
    ++counter;
    try {
        Atomics.wait(mem, 0, 0, Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY); // Just hang
    }
    finally {
        --counter;
        msg("If you see this then the script FAILED because the exiting wait was observed, counter=" + counter);
    }
}

<p>Tests that the main thread can be awoken by a worker.</p>

<p> Just load the page, click <button onclick="runTest()">This
Button</button>, and leave the browser alone.  The main thread will go
to sleep for a few seconds and then be worken by a worker thread, you
should see some output below.  If you receive the slow-script dialog
something is wrong.

<P> Also check the console for errors.

<script src="harness.js"></script>

<script>
var mem = new Int32Array(new SharedArrayBuffer(4));
var worker = new Worker("futexMainWakeup-worker.js");
worker.postMessage(["start", mem.buffer], [mem.buffer]);
worker.onmessage = function (ev) {
    msg(String(ev.data));
}
function runTest() {
    if (!canBlockOnThisThread) {
        msg("NO TEST: Atomics.wait is disabled (by the browser) on the main thread");
        return;
    }

    var time = 1000;
    worker.postMessage(["run", time]);
    var before = Date.now();
    Atomics.wait(mem, 0, 0, Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY);
    var after = Date.now();
    msg("Returned from wait after " + (after - before) + "ms, should be about " + time);
    msg("DONE");

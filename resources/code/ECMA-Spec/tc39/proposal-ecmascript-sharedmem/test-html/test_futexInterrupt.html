  <title>Tests that futexes can be interrupted on tab close or browser shutdown</title>
</head>

<body>

<p> This tests that futexes that are blocked will be interrupted and will
not block the browser when the tab is closed or the browser is shut
down. </p>

<p> Open this page in the browser.  It will create a worker that
blocks indefinitely in Atomics.wait().  No line should appear below that
says "THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN". </p>

<script src="harness.js"></script>
  
<p> Now try to close the tab or close the browser!  If the code works
as it should, the tab or browser should close; if you close the
browser you should see no trace of the browser process in a process
monitor or similar.</p>

<p>(Firefox devs: try ./mach run from the command prompt, ideally in a debug build,
since release builds will tend to just exit in a hard way if things get stuck.)</p>

var w = new Worker("futexInterrupt-worker.js");

var iab = new Int32Array(new SharedArrayBuffer(4));
w.postMessage(iab.buffer, [iab.buffer]);

  <title>Tests the timeout of Atomics.wait on the main thread</title>
</head>

<body>

<p> Tests Atomics.wait timeouts on the main thread. </p>
  
<p> Just load the page, click <button onclick="runTest()">This
Button</button>, and leave the browser alone.  The main thread will go
to sleep for a few seconds and then time out, you should see some
output below.  If you receive the slow-script dialog something is
wrong.

<P> Also check the console for errors.

<script src="harness.js"></script>

<script>
var mem = new Int32Array(new SharedArrayBuffer(4));

function runTest() {
    if (!canBlockOnThisThread) {
        msg("NO TEST: Atomics.wait() is disabled (by the browser) on the main thread");
        return;
    }

    var before = Date.now();
    Atomics.wait(mem, 0, 0, 1000); // Wait one second
    var after = Date.now();
    msg("Returned from wait after " + (after - before) + "ms, should be about 1000");

    var before = Date.now();
    Atomics.wait(mem, 0, 0, 1); // Wait one millisecond
    var after = Date.now();
    msg("Returned from wait after " + (after - before) + "ms, should be about 1");

    // In Firefox DEBUG builds the timeout is sliced into 2-second intervals, so a 5-second
    // wait here should test that logic without annoying the slow-script dialog.

    var before = Date.now();
    Atomics.wait(mem, 0, 0, 5000); // Wait five seconds
    var after = Date.now();
    msg("Returned from wait after " + (after - before) + "ms, should be about 5000");

    msg("DONE");

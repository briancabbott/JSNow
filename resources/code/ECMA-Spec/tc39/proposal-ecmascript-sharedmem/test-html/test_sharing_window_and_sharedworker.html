  <title>Tests sharing memory between a Window and its SharedWorker</title>
</head>

<body>
<p> This test case tests that sharing memory by postMessage between a
  Window and its SharedWorker <b>does not</b> work in either direction.</p>

<p> If everything goes OK there should be no lines below saying
  "SHOULD NOT HAPPEN", and instead there should be lines saying
  "SUCCESS - Failed to send".</p>

<p> Also check the console, there should be nothing unusual there. </p>

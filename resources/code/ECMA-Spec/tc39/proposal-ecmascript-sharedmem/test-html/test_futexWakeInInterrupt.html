  <title>Tests wakeup on Atomics.wait stuck in an interrupt callback</title>
</head>

<body>

<P> Firefox note: This test does not work with e10s (process separation) enabled.
    
<p> Just load the page, click <button onclick="runTest()">This
Button</button>, and leave the browser alone.  The main thread will go
to sleep for 10-15 seconds and then time out, and you'll see the slow-script dialog.

<P> No earlier than 25 seconds after clicking the button originally,
hit the Continue button on the slow-script dialog.  The timing is important; don't
click it too early.

<P> Immediately after the dialog closes you should see output in the page below.
If you get a second slow-script dialog then something has probably gone wrong.

<P> Also check the console for errors.

var mem = new Int32Array(new SharedArrayBuffer(4));

    if (!canBlockOnThisThread) {

        return;
    }

    if (!w) {
        w = new Worker("futexWakeInInterrupt-worker.js");
        w.postMessage([mem.buffer], [mem.buffer]);
        setTimeout(runTest, 500);
        return;
    }

    var before = Date.now();
    Atomics.wait(mem, 0, 0, 100000); // Wait 100 seconds
    var after = Date.now();
    msg("Returned from wait after " + (after - before) + "ms");

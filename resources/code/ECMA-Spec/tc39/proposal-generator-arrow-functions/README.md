# ECMAScript proposal: Generator Arrow Functions

**Authors**: Sergey Rubanov

**Champion**: [Hemanth HM](https://github.com/hemanth), Brendan Eich (?)

**Stage**: Stage 1 of [the TC39 process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/).

## Motivation

> Experience so far has been that people love arrow functions and generators and want a generator arrow.
> â€” Brendan Eich

Both [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) and [generators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*) are available since ES2015. Often people want to use generator arrow and this proposal (which was raised years ago) should solve their needs.

## Use cases

- [3 years old React example](https://gist.github.com/threepointone/014954c9270749d0b1d1051c12a705af)
- need more [use-cases](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-generator-arrow-functions/issues/1)

## Possible solutions

Discussion of future syntax: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-generator-arrow-functions/issues/2

### Arrow function syntax

```js
// Irregular
() =*> ...

// not the same order as in regular generator functions
() =>* ...

// also wrong order
() *=> ...

// ASI hazard
*() => ...
```

### Introduce new `generator` keyword for both `function` and arrow function

```js
generator function() {}
const foo = async generator function() {};

class Foo {
  x = 1
  // No more ASI hazard!
  generator foo() {}
}
```

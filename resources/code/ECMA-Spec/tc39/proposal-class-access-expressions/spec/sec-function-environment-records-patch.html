  <h1>Function Environment Records</h1>
  <p>A <dfn>function Environment Record</dfn> is a declarative Environment Record that is used to represent the top-level scope of a function and, if the function is not an |ArrowFunction|, provides a `this` binding. If a function is not an |ArrowFunction| function and references `super`, its function Environment Record also contains the state that is used to perform `super` method invocations from within the function.<ins> If a function is not an |ArrowFunction| function and references `class`, its function Environment Record also contains the state that is used to perform `class` property acccess from within the function.</ins></p>
  <p>Function Environment Records have the additional state fields listed in <emu-xref href="#table-additional-fields-of-function-environment-records"></emu-xref>.</p>

      1. Let _envRec_ be the function Environment Record for which the method was invoked.

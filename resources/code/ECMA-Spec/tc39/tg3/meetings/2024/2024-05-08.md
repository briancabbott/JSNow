## Agenda

### Signals proposal discussion

- concerns with proposal
  - MHN
    - observable global mutable state
    - nothing in js spec has internal state that can be observed and this proposal changes that
  - NRO: what is that state?
  - MHN: readme mentions there is some global state and is observable through APIs like Watcher
  - copy/pasted from plenary notes: MAH asked whether certain powerful APIs such as Signal.subtle.currentComputed (which may represent an unintended communication channel) are needed. The signal champions will follow up on this concern during regular SES calls; it is likely that the subtle APIs can be modified.

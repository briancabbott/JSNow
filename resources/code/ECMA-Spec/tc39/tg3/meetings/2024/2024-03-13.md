### meeting rescheduling

- do we need the 2nd meeting?

- suggestion to just have the weekly SES slot for TG3/SES purposes
- agenda convergence? how to manage?
- KKL happy to use SES time, provided some topics can be recorded
- Agoric offers zoom for meeting (recording)
  - currently posts to SES YT and goes through Agoric marketing
    - shouldn't be the case for TG3, but some venue is desired for publication (YT)
      - need to determine a neutral venue
- TG3: consensus to eliminate the APAC-friendly meeting
- clarification: TG3 meetings are open to all interested parties
- proposal: TG3 meetings Wednesdays at 10AM PT

  - KKL would join convenors group
  - consensus?
    - +1 MM, KKL, PHE, CDA, DPV, CM

- can we record TG3 meetings?

  - no prohibition on this from Ecma perspective
  - ultimately, up to participants
  - recordings can be stopped as needed
  - there can also be requests for redaction, or delay publication

- PHE: contributors to TC/TG need to sign RFTG agreement, etc.

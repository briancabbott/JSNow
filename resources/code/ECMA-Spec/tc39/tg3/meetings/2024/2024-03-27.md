### review of previous agenda and action items

GB: Topic extending source phase to JavaScript modules.

- by the time you have a handle on a wasm module, it's already passed CSP
- …
- dynamic import should remain the only execution mechanism `import(handleToModule)`
- only remaining ? case is Workers
- a Worker might have a different CSP policy, so we need to ensure it's not an escalation. (need a CSP re-check)

KKL: i think my previous solution was that a WeakMap in userland without a host CSP could have an emulated CSP in an unsafe-eval env. i think i'm satisfied with that. are you still proposing a difference between module instance and source?

GB: (Paraphrase: does still propose an eventual Module instance that could be used for multiple instantiation of a source, not included in the current proposal.)

KKL: Bindings array design (as opposed to separated imports and exports) <https://github.com/tc39/proposal-compartments/blob/master/1-static-analysis.md>

ACTION: CDA: YT account to post recordings. good idea to make private at least at first and only share with TG3/TC39

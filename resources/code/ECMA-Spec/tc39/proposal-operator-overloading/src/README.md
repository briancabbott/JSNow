This directory contains a rough implementation of an [operator overloading proposal](https://github.com/littledan/proposal-operator-overloading/). It is divided into two npm packages, which are in subdirectories:
- transform/ contains the source of @littledan/plugin-transform-operator-overloading, which 
- shim/ contains the source of @littledan/operator-overloading-shim, runtime support for the Babel plugin

Find instructions on usage in transform/README.md.

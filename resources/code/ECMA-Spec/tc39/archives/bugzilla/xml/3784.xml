    <thetext>Table 16 used to be titled &quot;Additional Components of Function Environment Records&quot;, but then rev31 changed &quot;Components&quot; to &quot;Fields&quot; and added double-square-brackets to the field names. Similarly for Global Environment Records in Table 18.

These changes strongly suggest that Function+Global Environment Records are now Records. (Although this seems obvious from the names, it was clearly *not* the case before rev31.) However, if that&apos;s the case:

(1) The tables&apos; header row should say &quot;Field Name&quot; rather than &quot;Component&quot;. And for consistency with other such tables (8, 21, 25, 36, ...), &quot;Purpose&quot; should be &quot;Meaning&quot;, and there should be a middle column labelled &quot;Value&quot; or &quot;Value Type&quot;.

(2) You should actually *say* that these things are Records in the sense of 6.2.1.

(3) You should maybe say how their bindings are represented in a Record.

(4) You should maybe say that all Environment Records are Records?</thetext>

    <thetext>Fixed in rev33 editor&apos;s draft

covered 1,2, 4.

3 is a separable issue.  We intentionally haven&apos;t described our bindings are represented.  It might be clearer to formalize in terms of lists and records. But probably not a high priority of ES6 release.  It may be worthwhile creating a separate  ticket for addressing this in the future.  Note there is a siilar issue relating to ordinary objects.  We don&apos;t really have a formalization of an object&apos;s property store.</thetext>

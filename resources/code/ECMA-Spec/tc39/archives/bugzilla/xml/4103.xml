    <thetext>The prose around the non-typed-array method suggests that it&apos;s to be called when a non-typed-array is passed as |target|.  Internally, that argument is passed to |ToObject| and its result ReturnIfAbrupt&apos;d.  This is inconsistent.  I would much prefer if there were a fundamental %TypedArray%.prototype.set algorithm, that invoked one or the other more-specific algorithm as desired, rather than make inconsistent claims about how the two algorithms are supposed to be used and/or work.

This would also permit moving the common code between the two algorithms -- steps 1-10, approximately -- into that overarching algorithm.</thetext>

    <thetext>see Bug 4102 
/target/ is the this value, not the argument.

I&apos;ve also clarified the assert in step 1 a bit.

Using this style of multiple algorithm for over-loaded methods is something that has some history in the ES spec. It&apos;s probably debatable whether it is better or worse than an simple method spec. that combines all the over-loads.

I&apos;m not going to do any more restructuring of that sort in the ES6 spec. so I&apos;m marking this as deferred to ES7 so it can be considered in that context.</thetext>

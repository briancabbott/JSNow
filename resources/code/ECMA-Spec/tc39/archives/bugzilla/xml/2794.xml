    <thetext>I would like to suggest a small change to the notation of parameterized
productions, specifically when parameters appear as subscripts of
nonterminals in a production&apos;s RHS.

For concreteness, consider the nonterminal N with parameter P.
My suggestion is to change the notation as follows:

    N[?P] -&gt;  N[P]
    N[P]  -&gt;  N[+P]
    N     -&gt;  N[~P]

Two reasons:

(1)
I think this notation would make parameterized productions somewhat easier
for readers to understand, mainly by leveraging their knowledge of how
parameters work in mathematics and programming languages.

(a) Changing N[?P] to N[P] ...

Generally, when a function wants to &quot;pass down&quot; the value of one of its
parameters, it simply references the parameter.

(b) Changing
    N[P]  to  N[+P]
    N     to  N[~P]

This re-uses the RHS-prefix notation [+P] and [~P], since the meanings are
parallel: as RHS-prefixes, they &apos;check&apos; for the presence/absence of a
parameter; as RHS-subscripts, they could *assert* the presence/absence
of a parameter (for the RHS-use of a nonterminal).

In an analogy with a programming language, we could imagine that each
parameter has two possible values, &apos;+&apos; and &apos;~&apos;. Then a RHS-prefix is
analogous to a boolean expression in a guard:
     [+P]  is analogous to  (P == &apos;+&apos;)
     [~P]                   (P == &apos;~&apos;)
and (with my above suggestion) a RHS-subscript is analogous to a named
argument:
    N[+P]  is analogous to  N(P = &apos;+&apos;)
    N[~P]                   N(P = &apos;~&apos;)
(You could *state* a similar analogy using the current notation, but I think
it&apos;d be less mnemonic, and wouldn&apos;t have the parallel with RHS-prefixes.)

(Conceivably, you could allow &quot;N&quot; as an shorthand for &quot;N[~P]&quot;, but I don&apos;t
think I&apos;d encourage it.)


(2)
In addition to making parameterized productions easier to understand,
I think it would also clarify references to parameterized nonterminals
*outside* productions.

Currently, when we say &quot;N[P]&quot; outside a production, it&apos;s unclear whether we
mean:
(a) all variants of N-parameterized-by-P
    (= what &quot;N[P]&quot; means when it appears in a production&apos;s *LHS*); or
(b) the particular variant in which parameter P is present/used/on
    (= what &quot;N[P]&quot; currently means when it appears in a production&apos;s *RHS*).

With my suggested notation, we can distinguish these as &quot;N[P]&quot; vs &quot;N[+P]&quot;.

Similarly, when we say &quot;N&quot; outside of a production, we almost always mean:
(a) any variant of N-parameterized-by-P,
but it&apos;s possible we might want to mean:
(b) the particular variant in which parameter P is absent/unused/off.

With my suggested notation, we can denote the latter as &quot;N[~P]&quot;.

    <thetext>The metadata attribute aspect of this is covered by other bugs:
&gt; There are now about 10000 tests. By default, they are sorted in the 
&gt; repo by source(Sputnik | ietestcenter)/chapter/section/subsection/...
&gt; Even if it certainly makes sense from a test suite producer point of 
&gt; view (and directory choices has to be made anyway), it doesn&apos;t cover all search use cases.
&gt; In order to &quot;identify test holes&quot; more efficiently as suggested under 
&gt; &quot;Community Contributions&quot; it would be helpful to have some tool to 
&gt; search for tests. For instance, it&apos;s currently hard to find if a test has been forgotten regarding:
&gt; * native prototype objects
&gt; For instance, in 15.4.2.2 is written &quot;The [[Prototype]] internal 
&gt; property of the newly constructed object is set to the original Array 
&gt; prototype object, the one that is the initial value of Array.prototype&quot;.
&gt; There is clearly a test to write based on that to make sure that 
&gt; Monkey-patched Array.prototype aren&apos;t used. Such a pattern can be 
&gt; found for functions (15.3.3, 15.3.4), objects (15.2.2.1 step 4) and certainly in other places.
&gt; * length properties
&gt; * Errors (make sure that code that should throw errors have a test for 
&gt; them)
&gt; * strict mode (I assume it&apos;s not going to be covered in a chapter)
&gt; * Any other cross-chapter topic you could think of.
&gt; Several different approaches could be taken to tackle that issue:
&gt; -- text-search
&gt; -- tags search</thetext>

    <thetext>Quoted the wrong email section:

&gt; - Run partial test suite
&gt; Running the test suite is currently long. I&apos;m currently reviewing FF4 
&gt; fails. When I close my web browser, I have to re-run all tests. 
&gt; However, most of the time, I don&apos;t care about most of them. I just 
&gt; want all those that I haven&apos;t reviewed yet. I wish the website could offer an easy way to run for instance:
&gt; - all chapter 15.2 tests (or any chapter/section/subsection obviously)
&gt; - all tests found through a search (if/when some search feature will 
&gt; be
&gt; available)
&gt; - all tests that has been added or changed between two test suite 
&gt; versions. If I have reviewed all tests of version x, I may not care 
&gt; about them when the x+1 version comes out.</thetext>

    <thetext>A wild guess is two weeks would be needed to implement this.</thetext>

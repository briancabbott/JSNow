Hi all,

In the current draft, I see 2 different places where assigning to an immutable binding (&apos;const&apos;) throws an error:

1) Dynamically throwing a TypeError in SetMutableBinding, http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-declarative-environment-records-setmutablebinding-n-v-s
...
1) throws only in strict mode code, while 2) throws regardless. 2) is also best effort; seems to be implementation-dependent what &quot;can statically determine&quot; entails.

Is the intention that assigning to consts silently nops if the implementation cannot determine the assignment to be to a const statically, in non-strict code, but implementations *should* make a best effort to report such cases eagerly, regardless of strictness? Seems kind of odd to me; perhaps I am misreading?

&gt;response

1) looks like a bug to me.  I pretty sure it was never the intent for assignments to const binding to silently fail in non-strict code. The current semantics of SetMutableBinding is a carry over from ES5 where immutable bindings were only used (I have to double check this) for FunctionExpression function name bindings. The legacy of ES3 (hence non-strict ES5) was to did not throw on assignments to such function name bindings.

I&apos;ll probably have to do some extra special casing to preserve the ES3/5 semantics for assignment to function names and make the throw unconditional to other immutable bindings

    <thetext>however, after thinking about this for a while I think the current spec&apos;ed behavior is probably necessary in order to not break existing code that uses various pre-ES6 standard forms of const declarations.</thetext>

    <thetext>In 15.4 &quot;Array Objects&quot;,
under &quot;Runtime Semantics: ArrayCreate Abstract Operation&quot;,
step 5 says:
    Set the [[NativeBrand]] internal property of A to the value NativeArray.
where &quot;NativeArray&quot; is in a sans-serif font.

I believe this is the only place in the spec where a value of the NativeBrand enumeration is called out with a different font from the surrounding text.

For consistency, change it to a serif font. (Personally, I&apos;d prefer that all the *other* occurrences were called out, but that&apos;d be more work.)</thetext>

    <thetext>I don&apos;t think this has really been resolved.

Allowing for the change from &apos;NativeFoo&apos; to &apos;BuiltinFoo&apos;, this bug is about the pseudo-code&apos;s inconsistency in denoting values of the BuiltinBrand enumeration. i.e. whether or not to call them out via a different font from the surrounding text.

You could fix the bug by making them all not-called-out (which I suggested), or all called-out (which I&apos;d prefer). The former would have involved changing just the one occurrence I noted; the latter would have involved changing every *other* occurrence.

The occurrence of &apos;BuiltinArray&apos; in the defn of ArrayCreate is still in a distinct font from its surrounding text, and more such occurrences have been called out, suggesting that you were going for the latter (&quot;all called-out&quot;) fix. However, many &apos;BuiltinFoo&apos; values are not called out, so the inconsistency still exists.

(I count about 10 occurrences called out versus about 50 not called-out.)

(Possibly this is a Word vs PDF discrepancy: I&apos;m looking at the PDF.)</thetext>

    <thetext>we don&apos;t use built-in brands at all anymore, but now brand built-ins using double bracketed internal properties so this font issue should now be completely gone.

fixed in rev 16 editor&apos;s draft</thetext>

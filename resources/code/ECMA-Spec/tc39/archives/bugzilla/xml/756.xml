    <thetext>Within section 15, I&apos;m looking at the sections with titles like &quot;new Foo(...)&quot;, i.e. the sections that define the behaviour that is bound to the [[Construct]] internal property of built-in constructor-objects.

For some of these, the behavior is given as an algorithm:
    15.2.2.1  new Object ( [ value ] )
    15.3.2.1  new Function (p1, p2, ..., pn, body)
    15.4.2.1  new Array ( [ item0 [ , item1 [ , ... ] ] ] )
    15.4.2.2  new Array (len)
    15.14.3.1 new Map (iterable = [ ])

For the rest, the behaviour is given in prose, but could be straightforwardly recast as an algorithm.

---

For instance,
    15.5.2.1 new String ( [ value ] )
could say (something like):
    1. Let /S/ be a newly created ECMAScript object.
    2. Set the [[Prototype]] internal property of /S/ to the standard
       built-in String prototype object that is the initial value of
       String.prototype (15.5.3.1).
    3. Set the [[NativeBrand]] internal property of /S/ to StringWrapper.
    4. Set the [[Extensible]] internal property of /S/ to true.
    5. Set the [[PrimitiveValue]] internal property of /S/ to
       ToString(/value/), or to the empty String if /value/ is not supplied.
    6. Return /S/

As an algorithm, the behavior is more concrete and more uniformly expressed. It also clarifies that this method is responsible for creating (and returning) the object. (The existing prose simply refers to &quot;the newly constructed object&quot;, which isn&apos;t very clear.)

---

In a few cases:
    15.9.3.1 new Date (year, month [, date [, hours etc )
    15.9.3.2 new Date (value)
    15.13.6.2.1 new TypeArray(arg0 [, arg1 [, arg2 ] )
    15.13.7.2.1 new DataView(buffer [, byteOffset [, byteLength]])
the [[Construct]] behavior is currently given partly in prose and partly in algorithm; here, the prose parts could be recast as steps and added to the algorithm.

Also, in
    15.10.4.1 new RegExp(pattern, flags)
the behavior is given as an algorithm, but it&apos;s a single step that just calls RegExpCreate, and the latter is expressed in prose. But it looks like the prose could be fairly easily recast as an algorithm.</thetext>

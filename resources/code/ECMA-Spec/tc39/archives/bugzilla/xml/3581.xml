    <thetext>Step 5 of the ToInteger abstract operation reads:

5. Return the result of computing sign(number) × floor(abs(number)).

--

First interpretation: × is a mathematical operator:

sign, floor, and abs, as well as the multiplication, operate on mathematical finite real number (according to 5.2 Algorithm Conventions), where +0 = -0 = 0. Thus, when number = -0.2, the output of the mathematical expression is simply 0. 

Then, there is an implicit operation in this step, which is &quot;taking the Number value of the result&quot;; and for 0, it is +0.

--

Second interpretation: × is part of the representation of a Number value as
s × m × 2^e:

In that interpretation the result is correct; but the fact that the m × 2^e part is expressed as a result of a mathematical expression and the use of &quot;computing&quot; in that step don&apos;t favor that interpretation.

--

It should be made clear both the fact we return a Number value (rather than a mathematical number), and (more importantly) that the sign is preserved even if the result is zero. For example:

5. Return the Number value of same sign as number and of magnitude floor(abs(number)).

--

(There is a similar issues for ToInt32, etc.; I&apos;m opening another bug for those.)</thetext>

    <thetext>Oh, this is very old text, probably going all the way back to ES1

It actually isn&apos;t obvious to me that that the intent was to return -0 for ToInteger(-0.2) as I think your first interpretation is quite plausable .

Also, based upon a quick can of all usages to ToInteger (especially the ones that date to ES3 or earlier) it isn&apos;t clear that anything in the spec. is actually sensitive to whether 0 or -1 is returned for the this case.

However, given that it is clearly returning number values (including -0) in other cases, I think it is probably correct to assume that ToInteger(-0.2) should return -0 

so, fixed in rev32 editor&apos;s draft</thetext>

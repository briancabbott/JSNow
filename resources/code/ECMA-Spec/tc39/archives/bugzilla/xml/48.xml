    <thetext>Should we have (at least) two categories of test cases:
1.  Those that are directly from ES5 or those that can be inferred from ES5
2.  Those that contradict ES5 yet are de-facto web standards

Arguably the first category could be split in two as well.</thetext>

    <thetext>My two cents on this is it&apos;d be extremely useful for TC-39 to know about the second category of tests so the de-facto functionality could be incorporated into ECMAScript v.Next.  That said, I do not think such a category should ever be exposed to the public on http://test262.ecmascript.org.  The test suite needs to remain true to the spec.  That said, I think it would be absolutely fine to be able to run this from the command-line version of Test262 (to be created) if one passes the appropriate flags to the harness.  Also, it&apos;s fine to keep such tests in the Test262 Mercurial repository provided they&apos;re separated from the category one tests  (e.g., test\suite\nonstandard\).

A related opinion on this is that test cases covering ES5 errata should exist in the first category of tests.


Based on a command-line extension only, I&apos;m guessing this could be done in well under a day.  Populating test\suite\nonstandard\ is an entirely different story though.</thetext>

    <thetext>We now have a test\suite\bestPractices directory.  Just need to support this in some capacity from packager.py and possibly sth.js.</thetext>

    <thetext>packager.py now generates a testcases_bestPractice.html directory alongside default.html.  E.g., http://test262.ecmascript.org/testcases_bestPractice.html

All that needs to be done now is change the text on testcases_bestPractice.html so people don&apos;t confuse it with the &apos;required&apos; ES test suite.</thetext>

    <thetext>Text on testcases_bestPractice.html has been updated as well to ensure no confusion between this and default.html.</thetext>

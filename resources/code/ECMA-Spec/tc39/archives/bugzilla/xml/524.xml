    <thetext>Section 6, Source Text, and the rest of the specification should use the term &quot;Unicode code point&quot; rather than &quot;Unicode character&quot; or &quot;Unicode scalar value&quot; when referring to the general content of source text or text interpreted from UTF-16 code unit sequences.

For &quot;character&quot;, people have different ideas what the term means, and redefining it, as ES5 did, would just add to the confusion.

&quot;Unicode character&quot; is not defined in the Unicode standard, as far as I can tell, but seems to be used in the sense of &quot;code point assigned to abstract character&quot; or possibly &quot;designated code point&quot;. With either definition, it would exclude code points reserved for future assignment, such as characters that were added in Unicode 6.1 if your implementation was based on Unicode 5.1. Such a restriction would be a constant source of interoperability problems.

&quot;Unicode scalar value&quot; is defined in the Unicode standard as &quot;Any Unicode code point except high-surrogate and low-surrogate code points.&quot; We cannot exclude surrogate code points from source code, as this would break compatibility with existing code.

&quot;Unicode code point&quot; and &quot;UTF-16 code unit&quot; are the terms we have to use most of the time.

The term &quot;Unicode character&quot; can be used when only assigned characters are meant, e.g., when referring to individual characters such as &quot;comma&quot; or &quot;reverse solidus&quot;, or to the characters that can be used in identifiers.</thetext>

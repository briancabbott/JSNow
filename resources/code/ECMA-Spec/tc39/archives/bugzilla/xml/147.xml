ES5 discussion group (cc&apos;ing Lars)-

(My apologies if the issue described below has already been discussed; I could not find mention of it in the ES5 erratum [1], nor is it corrected in the 5.1 maintenance revision of the ES5 specification [2].) 

In the ES5 spec from December 2009, at the top of page 206, there is a bit of text that is probably erroneously referring to the italicized /space/ parameter.

In particular, the text in question (which is part of the definition of the abstract operation &quot;JO(value)&quot;) reads, starting from the bottom of page 205:

  ii. Let /member/ be the concatenation of /member/ and the colon character.
 iii. If /gap/ is not the empty String
     1. Let /member/ be the concatenation of /member/ and the /space/ character.

The text &quot;the /space/ character&quot;, interpreted literally, does not make sense; the use of italicized /space/ would be interpreted as a reference to the Number or String value, which do not generally serve as names for characters.

Lars Hansen pointed out this problem in a comment while making an Actionscript implementation of the JSON class [3].  

A reasonable hypothesis is that this is a formatting typo, and that the occurrence of the word &quot;space&quot; should not have been italicized.  However, the text introducing the &quot;JO(value)&quot; abstract operation explicitly states that the operation has access to /space/ of the invocation of the stringify method, while there are no other references to /space/ that I can see in the text defining the &quot;JO(value)&quot; abstract operation.  So that would also need to be corrected if this is just a formatting typo.

Cheers,

    <thetext>see comment in original bug.  The mention of RepalcerFunction in the intro to JO is also unneeded.</thetext>

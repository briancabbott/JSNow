    <thetext>Why do you say that?

Both of those lines exist for specific purposes relating to the use of the %TypedArray% intrinsic, and primarily come into play when AllocateTypedArray is called from it.

The first line says that you get an exception if you attempt to directly call %TypedArray%

%TypedArray% is intended to only be super new&apos;ed by its subclass constructors.

The second line says that you get an exception if you try to directly invoke &apos;new&apos; on %TypedArray%</thetext>

    <thetext>do you have a follow up.  If not, I&apos;ll close this as invalid.</thetext>

Allen, I think steps 5.a-b can do these two things, or am i missing something?</thetext>

    <thetext>You&apos;re technically correct. But, I think the redundancy is good, from a specification perspective as lines 1-2 and 5-5e are actually addressing distinct requirements.  The first is that you aren&apos;t alled to directly call or new %TypedArray&quot;.

Step 5 is saying that valid subclass must have a [[TypedArrayonstructorName]] somewhere on its subclass chain but below %TypedArray% 

While the mechanism used to do step 5 also covers 1-2 we could leave out 1-2. But that conflates the separate requirements in a way that may make the 1-2 requirements less obvious. 

In fact, I went the other direction.  I added a NOTE after step two clarify the purpose of the first two lines.

But implementations, of course, are free to do that sort of optimization.</thetext>

I see now. Thank you.</thetext>

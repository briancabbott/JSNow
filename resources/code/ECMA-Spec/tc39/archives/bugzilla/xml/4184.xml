    <thetext>8.1.1.5.5 CreateImportBinding (N, M, N2)

Step 4: 
&gt; Assert: When M.[[Environment]] is instantiated it will have a direct binding for N2.

I think this assertion actually needs to test that the module record M was successfully instantiated, i.e. its ModuleDeclarationInstantiation concrete method has been invoked and successfully completed (cf. 15.2.1.15.5 ModuleEvaluation step 2).</thetext>

    <thetext>Also, as I mentioned in a thread to es-discuss (https://esdiscuss.org/topic/re-exporting-imports-and-createimportbinding-assertions), this assertion&apos;s claim about the binding of N2 seems too strong: it needs to have a binding, but it may be an indirect binding if it is itself an import binding.</thetext>

&gt; 8.1.1.5.5 CreateImportBinding (N, M, N2)
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; I think this assertion actually needs to test that the module record M was
&gt; successfully instantiated, i.e. its ModuleDeclarationInstantiation concrete
&gt; method has been invoked and successfully completed (cf. 15.2.1.15.5
&gt; ModuleEvaluation step 2).

I don&apos;t thing that needs to be true at the time the binding is created.  If the binding is every used (via GetBindingValue) and M has not been fully instantiated then GetBindingValue with throw because M.[[Environbment]] will be undefined.

All the assertion is saying is that the source code for M must have a local export for the referenced name. It&apos;s essentially an assertion about the linkability of the two modules rather than about actual initializaiton</thetext>

&gt; Also, as I mentioned in a thread to es-discuss
&gt; (https://esdiscuss.org/topic/re-exporting-imports-and-createimportbinding-
&gt; assertions), this assertion&apos;s claim about the binding of N2 seems too
&gt; strong: it needs to have a binding, but it may be an indirect binding if it
&gt; is itself an import binding.

No the only place CreateImportBinding is called (in ModuleDeclarationInstantiation) M and N2 are supplied by a preceding call to ResolveExport where the /resolution/ has already been determine to be neither unresolved or ambiguous.  Because ResolveExport in such cases  never resolves to another indirect binding.  Instead it always resolved to the &quot;leaf&quot; definition (ie, a module binding that is not an indirect binding).</thetext>

    <thetext>With the fixes made in rev37 WRT indirect bindings and export records should address the concern in comment #1</thetext>

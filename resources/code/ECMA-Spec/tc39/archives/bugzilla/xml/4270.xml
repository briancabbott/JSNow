    <thetext>The note on 7.2.13 says:

&quot;This algorithm differs from the SameValue Algorithm (7.2.9) in its treatment of signed zeroes and NaNs.&quot;

The symmetric note however is *not* present in 7.2.9.

------

Suggestion (1): For helpful clarity, add this note to 7.2.9:

&quot;This algorithm differs from the Strict Equality Comparison Algorithm (7.2.13) in its treatment of signed zeroes and NaNs.&quot;

-------

Also to aid in clarity, one can observe the implication of these notes, which is that one could simply reference the other, after first expressing the two exceptions (NaN and -0).

For example, Strict Equality Comparison Algorithm could be significantly simplified like this:


The comparison x === y, where x and y are values, produces true or false. Such a comparison is performed as follows:

1. If Type(x) is Number, then
   If x is NaN, return false.
   If y is NaN, return false.
   If x is +0 and y is −0, return true.
   If x is −0 and y is +0, return true.
2. If SameValue(x, y) is true, then return true.
3. Return false.


The advantage here is not just a simpler spec, but it reinforces the implication of those notes discussed earlier. It makes it clear the relationship between the two algorithms. A rewritten section as I suggest wouldn&apos;t need a note, because it&apos;s now obvious.

However, the suggested 7.2.9 note above would still be a benefit to cross-reference clarity.

Of course, you could do the reverse symmetrical, and simplify SameValue as invoking === after tackling the exceptions.</thetext>

    <thetext>fixed in rev38 editor&apos;s draft

added the note to 7.2.9

any algorithm restructuring will have to wait until ES7.  File free to file that part of this item as a new ticket against ES7.</thetext>

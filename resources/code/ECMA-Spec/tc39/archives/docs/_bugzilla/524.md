With either definition, it would exclude code points reserved for future assignment, such as characters that were added in Unicode 6.1 if your implementation was based on Unicode 5.1. Such a restriction would be a constant source of interoperability problems.\n\n\"Unicode scalar value\" is defined in the Unicode standard as \"Any Unicode code point except high-surrogate and low-surrogate code points.\" We cannot exclude surrogate code points from source code, as this would break compatibility with existing code.\n\n\"Unicode code point\" and \"UTF-16 code unit\" are the terms we have to use most of the time.\n\nThe term \"Unicode character\" can be used when only assigned characters are meant, e.g., when referring to individual characters such as \"comma\" or \"reverse solidus\", or to the characters that can be used in identifiers."},{"commentid":5907,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-10-18 15:08:31 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev20 editor's draft"},{"commentid":6104,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-10-29 09:45:49 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev20 draft, Oct. 28, 2013"},{"commentid":9633,"comment_count":3,"who":{"uid":"ecmascriptbugs","name":"Norbert"},"bug_when":"2014-07-27 21:31:03 -0700","thetext":"Verified in rev 26 draft."}]}}

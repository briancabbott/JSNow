This kind sentence with two “be” in the same sentence appears in the next section and in the “++”, “--”, etc. operators (at least).\n\nThe other alternative would be to use it each time, thus saying “Type(GetBase(lref)) is Environment Record is true” in the line just below, but this is combersome.\n\nMartin."},{"commentid":14766,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"brterlso","name":"Brian Terlson"},"bug_when":"2015-10-03 18:54:21 -0700","thetext":"No longer applies to ES2015."}]}}

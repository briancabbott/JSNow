But according to 15.3.4.2 Function.prototype.toString() returns an implementation-dependent representation of a function. And there is the following note:\n---\nNote in particular that the use and placement of white space, line terminators, and semicolons within the representation String is implementation-dependent.\n---\n\nThat means the spec clearly allows for an implementation to return a string with leading whitespace before the \"function\" keyword. S15.5.4.13_A3_T3 and S15.5.4.14_A3_T3 wouldn't pass in this situation since they only expect the prefix \"function\" without any other leading characters."},{"commentid":655,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"andrebargull","name":"André Bargull"},"bug_when":"2012-02-23 20:43:07 -0800","thetext":"Applies to S15.5.4.15_A3_T7 as well"},{"commentid":667,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"dfugate","name":"Dave Fugate"},"bug_when":"2012-02-24 10:50:53 -0800","thetext":"In all three test cases:\n    var __instance =  function(){};\n\nhas been changed to:\n    var __instance = { toString: function() { return \"function(){}\";} };\n\n\nChanges have been pushed to Hg, but are not yet on the live website."}]}}

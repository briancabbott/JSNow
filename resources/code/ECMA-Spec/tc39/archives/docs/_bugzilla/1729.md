So it cannot be named \"eval\" or \"arguments\". Just like for strict function names."},{"commentid":4943,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-08-16 13:31:42 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev17 editor's draft"},{"commentid":5061,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-08-23 08:22:22 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev17, August 23, 2013 draft"}]}}

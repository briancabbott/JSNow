Inconsistencies like this are the sort of thing that end up in blog posts about PHP ;) but maybe now is the time to break from caring about holes. \n\nAllen, here: https://github.com/domenic/Array.prototype.contains/issues/15#issuecomment-51134702 you mentioned consistency with indexOf, are you thinking we should throw it to the wind for both? \n\nLastly, is everyone here prepared to defend the inevitable mud-slinging that will result in creating inconsistent API semantics?

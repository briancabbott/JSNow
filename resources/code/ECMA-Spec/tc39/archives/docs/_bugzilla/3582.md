Let int be ToInteger(argument).\n2. ReturnIfAbrupt(int).\n3. If int is -0, let int be +0.\n4. (proceed with current steps 5-6).\n\n(The above does not apply to ToUInt8Clamp, which is fine.)"},{"commentid":11602,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-01-22 16:09:47 -0800","thetext":"and also, unlike ToInteger, +/- infinity is not preserved."},{"commentid":11603,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-01-22 16:23:49 -0800","thetext":"fixed in rev32 editor's draft\n\nI copied the new ToInteger langue into step 4 of each.

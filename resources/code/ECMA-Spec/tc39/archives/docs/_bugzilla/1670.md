But [[ViewedArrayBuffer]] is also used to test for TypedArray resp. DataView object-ness, that means an algorithm which currently only tests for [[ViewedArrayBuffer]] can not differentiate between both kinds of objects. \n\nFor example the abstract operation for DataView objects \"GetViewValue()\" is currently also applicable for TypedArray objects. \n\nOr 15.13.6.3.6 \"%TypedArray%.prototype.set(array, offset = 0 )\", step 11 is currently undefined because only [[ViewedArrayBuffer]] is tested on the target variable, but if target is a DataView object [[TypedArrayName]] is not present.\n\nOr you can use the DataView constructor to perform (half-)initialisation of TypedArray objects ([[ViewedArrayBuffer]], [[ByteLength]], and [[ByteOffset]] get updated, but [[ArrayLength]] is still 0)."},{"commentid":4987,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-08-21 13:01:28 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev17 editor's draft"},{"commentid":5148,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-08-23 08:23:13 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev17, August 23, 2013 draft"}]}}

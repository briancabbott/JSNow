This has caused a bit of confusion with some people believing their browser has hung on particularly slow machines (think netbooks here).  Ideally we'd break these up into several test cases where each takes under a second to run on reasonable hardware with the majority of browsers.  Any ways, one such 'slow' running test is S15.1.3.1_A1.11_T2.js which is performing string operations in a nested for loop."}]}}

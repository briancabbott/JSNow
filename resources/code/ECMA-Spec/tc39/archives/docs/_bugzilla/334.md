For new functionality (say, a break iterator), we can simply add a new constructor named something like Intl.v8BreakIterator, but we are struggling to figure out how to implement things like version numbers.\n\nLet's say we want to provide a way to the user to know the version of our API and the version of ICU used in the browser build. We cannot simply have a normal readable but not writable property in the Intl object for that. We would need to make a constructor called something like Intl.v8GetVersions that people are supposed to 'new', and then get another object that they could investigate for the version info.\n\nWhy is there such a limitation on Intl's properties?"},{"commentid":874,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"ecmascriptbugs","name":"Norbert"},"bug_when":"2012-04-26 18:37:16 -0700","thetext":"I meant this sentence as a description of the standard properties, not as a restriction on implementation dependent additional properties. It's similar in that respect to the specification of the JSON object in Ecma-262, which starts with \"The JSON object is a single object that contains two functions, parse and stringify...\", but of course the Conformance clause of the standard allows additional properties.\n\nAllen, what do you think - do we need to edit all such descriptions to clarify that they only describe the standard properties, or is the Conformance clause sufficient to let implementers add other properties of any type?"},{"commentid":1043,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"ecmascriptbugs","name":"Norbert"},"bug_when":"2012-06-21 17:09:22 -0700","thetext":"Changed to \"The value of each of the standard built-in properties of the Intl object is a constructor.\""}]}}

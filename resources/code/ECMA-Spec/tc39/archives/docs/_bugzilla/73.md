The 'enumerate' trap would just reify this new internal\nmethod ( [[enumerate]]? ) and as such there would be no need to modify\nthe for-in statement definition as it is in\nhttp://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:proxies_semantics#modifications_to_the_evaluation_of_expressions_and_statements.\n----------------"},{"commentid":342,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2011-07-20 16:09:38 -0700","thetext":"move to ES6 draft"},{"commentid":10111,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-09-01 10:27:59 -0700","thetext":"In ES6 this is the [[Enumerate]]  internal method"}]}}

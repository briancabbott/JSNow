The only differences in the replacement steps are:\n\n1.a:  apply the changes described in Bug 4427\n1.a.ii.2 and 1.a.ii.2: Replace /instantiatedVarNames/ with /declaredVarNames/\n1.a.ii.2.a and 1.a.ii.2.c: Replace /varEnvRec/ with /envRec/\n\n\nAlso see https://esdiscuss.org/topic/block-level-function-declarations-web-legacy-compatibility-bug"},{"commentid":14556,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"andrebargull","name":"Andr√© Bargull"},"bug_when":"2015-07-18 01:12:57 -0700","thetext":"Adding block-scoped function declarations to scripts requires more (static and dynamic) checks, that's why I thought B.3.3 was restricted to functions.\n\nAdditional checks:\n- Check HasLexicalDeclaration() is false\n- Check CanDeclareGlobalFunction() is true\n- Install the global binding with CreateGlobalFunctionBinding()\n\nI've put up a gist to show the additional changes:\nhttps://gist.github.com/anba/07c83c4137990bdaa932\n\n(It's not quite clear to me if the binding should be installed using CanDeclareGlobalFunction+CreateGlobalFunctionBinding or alternatively using CanDeclareGlobalVar+CreateGlobalVarBinding.)"}]}}

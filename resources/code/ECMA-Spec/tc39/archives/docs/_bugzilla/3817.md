A consequence of that change, is that Error.prototype and objects inherited from it will be tagged as [object Error] by O.p.toString. That doesn't seem dangerous, because AFAICS, Error instances have no method that would choke on non-Error objects."},{"commentid":12743,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-02-15 15:00:09 -0800","thetext":"the final ES6 changes WRT O.p.toString and @@toStringTag were made at the Jan 2015 TC39 meeting https://github.com/tc39/tc39-notes/blob/master/es6/2015-01/jan-28.md#45-tostringtag\n\nHowever, this looks like a change that could be made in a future edition so I'm marking this one as deferred to ES7"}]}}

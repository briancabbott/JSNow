Most programming languages will have some feature for\n  representing such collections, which can go by names like record, struct,\n  dict, map, hash, or object.\n\nHowever, most of these programming language features cannot represent\narbitrary collections of name/value pairs.  Instead they represent something\nmore like a (single-valued) mapping from names to values.  If JSON objects\nare intended to be arbitrary collections of name-value pairs, then the list\nof analogous programming language constructs should be changed."}]}}

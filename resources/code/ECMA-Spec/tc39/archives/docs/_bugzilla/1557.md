It typically includes a fairly complete but not specification-level description of the feature and a justification for why it should be added to ECMAScript.\n\nAfter TC-39 reviews a strawman, it may decide that the feature is a likely candidate for inclusion in an upcoming ECMAScript edition.  If that occurs, the feature advances to \"proposal\" status and works begins on an actual specification of the feature.\n\nAnybody can writeup a strawman and post it for discussion on es-discuss.\n\nIf there seems to be interest in the feature on es-discuss, the next step is to find a TC39 member to champion the strawman at an actual TC39 meeting."},{"commentid":6867,"comment_count":5,"who":"pincopalla00","bug_when":"2013-11-30 16:46:53 -0800","thetext":"(In reply to comment #4)\n> Anybody can writeup a strawman and post it for discussion on es-discuss.\n\nThank for your reply.

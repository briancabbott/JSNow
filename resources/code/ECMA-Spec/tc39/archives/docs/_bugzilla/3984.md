A String value? A sequence of code units, a type that's not explicitly defined but used for SVs and TVs?\n\n- Write the algorithm steps that use it so that they actually call an abstract operation. E.g., in 11.6.1.1: “It is a Syntax Error if SV(UnicodeEscapeSequence) is neither the result of UTF16Encode(cp) (10.1.1) for a single Unicode code point cp with the Unicode property “ID_Start” nor \"$\" or \"_\".”"},{"commentid":12911,"comment_count":6,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-02-18 09:00:08 -0800","thetext":"removed the dash and added an arguemnt list to its section header just like UNT16Decode\n\nI'm not going to try to further formalize its return result or invocation for Es6\n\nso.

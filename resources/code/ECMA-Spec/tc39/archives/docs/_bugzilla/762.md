Word and grapheme boundary analysis are things that we do a fair amount of in our applications (for features such as dictionary lookup, text highlighting that is scripted, etc.). For some languages, such as JP, CN, Thai, etc., this can't be done trivially and requires a large data set to do a high quality job of. There exist some smaller, statistically based implementations, but these are not accurate enough for our needs."},{"commentid":3018,"comment_count":3,"who":{"uid":"ecmascriptbugs","name":"Norbert"},"bug_when":"2012-12-17 16:15:37 -0800","thetext":"At the 2012-12-14 internationalization meeting Rich was asked to write a strawman."},{"commentid":3108,"comment_count":4,"who":{"uid":"gillam","name":"Richard Gillam"},"bug_when":"2013-01-04 18:07:28 -0800","thetext":"See http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=globalization:text_segmentation, such as it is.

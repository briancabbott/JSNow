(Or absent, which is the same as \"normal\".) This is also a string.\n\nFunctionInitialize accepts a second mandatory argument, named kind, which can be one of Normal, Method, Arrow. The type of this argument seems to be a spec-level constant instead of a string.\n\n---\n\nThis is pretty confusing. It would be best if these concepts could either be collapsed (unlikely) or renamed so that at most one of them is using the word \"kind\"."}]}}

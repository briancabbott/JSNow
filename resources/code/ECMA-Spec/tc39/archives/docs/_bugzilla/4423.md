More specifically, you can write (?# your comments like this), so EcmaScript regular expressions like these:\n\n/(?=^[^%\\\\#]+$)(?=^\\S.*$)(?=^.*\\S$).*/\n\ncould be commented as such:\n\n/(?#\nExclude %, \\ and # characters\n\n)(?=^[^%\\\\#]+$)(?#\nMake sure that the string starts with a non-whitespace character\n\n)(?=^\\S.*$)(?#\nMake sure that the string ends in a non-whitespace character\n\n)(?=^.*\\S$)(?#\nIf all previous lookaheads were successful, match everything\n\n).*/\n\nNote that the latter expression is still a valid regular expression equivalent to the above."}]}}

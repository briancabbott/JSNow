The current format specifications for DateTimeFormat have no way to describe such representations, except for the month component. While implementations may choose to use these representations in formats that include a short/medium/long month, there's no way to adequately report this back in resolvedOptions, and there's no way to request a time format such as 1時31分07秒.\n\nSupport for these formats should be added."},{"commentid":1861,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"cira","name":"Nebojša Ćirić"},"bug_when":"2012-10-05 14:24:22 -0700","thetext":"Related ICU bug - http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/9626."}]}}

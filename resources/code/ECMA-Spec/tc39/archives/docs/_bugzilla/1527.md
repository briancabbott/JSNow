There are no tests for this behavior, which seems a serious gap. The Test402 test suite has a test 11.3.2_TRP, from which a test for toFixed could be derived (note however that toFixed uses exponential format in some case, while Intl.NumberFormat.prototype.format doesn't)."},{"commentid":4097,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"ecmascriptbugs","name":"Norbert"},"bug_when":"2013-05-26 04:06:07 -0700","thetext":"The description should have said toPrecision rather than toFixed.

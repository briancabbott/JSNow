Luke Hoban suggested that morally the language wants to treat this as though 'let' and 'of' are maximally interpreted as keywords in this context since there is no back compat requirement.  I.e. both of the both should be let declarations of a variable 'of' and the collection should be the array literal [0] in each.\n\nSeems this will require a small spec change along the lines of:\n\nfor ([lookahead not in {let}] LeftHandSideExpression  of AssignmentExpression ) Statement \n\nHowever this will now disallow 'let' as a variable name in the LHSExpression, so further clarification would be required to allow that."},{"commentid":7248,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-02-12 14:02:40 -0800","thetext":"fixed in rev23 editor's draft.\n\nAdded [lookahead not in { let }] prefix for for-of\nbut a [lookahead not in { let [ }] prefix for for-in, just like ExpressionStatement.\n\nHence:\n\nfor (let of of [0])...  //ForDeclaration of AssignmentExpression\nfor (let in [0])...     //LeftHandSideExpression in Expression\nfor (let of in [0])...  //ForDeclaration in Expression\nfor (let [of] in [0])...//LeftHandSideExpression in Expression"},{"commentid":7250,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-02-12 14:06:16 -0800","thetext":"*** Bug 2522 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***"},{"commentid":7543,"comment_count":3,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-04-06 11:30:03 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev23 draft"}]}}

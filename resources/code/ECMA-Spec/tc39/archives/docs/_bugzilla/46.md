Such a pattern can be \n> found for functions (15.3.3, 15.3.4), objects (15.2.2.1 step 4) and certainly in other places.\n> * length properties\n> * Errors (make sure that code that should throw errors have a test for \n> them)\n> * strict mode (I assume it's not going to be covered in a chapter)\n> * Any other cross-chapter topic you could think of.\n> Several different approaches could be taken to tackle that issue:\n> -- text-search\n> -- tags search"},{"commentid":102,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"dfugate","name":"Dave Fugate"},"bug_when":"2011-03-02 16:55:02 -0800","thetext":"Quoted the wrong email section:\n\n> - Run partial test suite\n> Running the test suite is currently long.

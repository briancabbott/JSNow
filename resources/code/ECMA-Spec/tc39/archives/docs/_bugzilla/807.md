The section B.3.1.2 should be corrected with setting Enumerable as false.\n\n-------\nB.3.1.1 Object.prototype.__proto__\nThe initial value of the __proto__ property of the Object prototype object is a data property whose initial value is  null. This property initially has the attributes { [[Writable]]: true, [[Enumerable]]: false, [[Configurable]]: true }.\n-------\nB.3.1.2 Changes To Internal Methods\n…\n\nThe definition of the [[DefineOwnProperty]] internal method given in 8.12.9 is replaced with the following:\n1.\tIf UnderscoreProtoEnabled is true and P is the string value \"__proto__\" and O is the standard built-in Object prototype object, then \na.\tIf any attribute contained in Desc is not present or has a different value from the corresponding attribute in { [[Writable]]: true, [[Enumerable]]: true, [[Configurable]]: true }then,\ni.\tSet UnderscoreProtoEnabled to false.\n-------"}]}}

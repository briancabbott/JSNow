[...]\n\nBut s==Object(s) evaluates to false according to 7.2.10 <http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-abstract-equality-comparison>. We reach the newly added step 8:\n\n> If Type(x) is Symbol or Type(y) is Symbol, return false.\n\nand at that point we return false.  Curiously, the new step has no effect on the algorithm, since we would have ended up returning false at the last step anyway."},{"commentid":9600,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-07-26 15:52:52 -0700","thetext":"Also see Bug 3016\n\nRight the update to 72.10 to make s==Object(s) produce true was wrong.\n\nThe new step 8 is unnecessary and steps 10&11 should include Symbol along with String and Number as triggering a ToPrimitive call.\n\nFixed in rev27 editor's draft"},{"commentid":9961,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-08-25 08:29:30 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev27 draft"}]}}

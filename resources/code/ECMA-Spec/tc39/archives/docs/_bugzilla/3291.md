Set importedModule.[[Namespace]] to namespace\n\nThis way the created namespace can be reused again later. I couldn't see the namespace being set anywhere else otherwise.\n\nNote it may be worth considering separating namespace creation into an easier function to share, as the browser loader spec would also need to create namespaces for loading modules that don't already have them. Perhaps this is a completely separate process though, but they should ideally share the module.[[Namespace]] object somehow."},{"commentid":10546,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"andrebargull","name":"Andr√© Bargull"},"bug_when":"2014-10-30 07:39:50 -0700","thetext":"This is already handled in 9.4.6.13 ModuleNamespaceCreate, step 11."}]}}

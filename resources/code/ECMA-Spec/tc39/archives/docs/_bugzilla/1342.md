Otherwise, find returns null. predicate is called only for elements of the array which actually exist; it is not called for missing elements of the array.\n\n1. Let O be the result of ToObject passing the this value as the argument.\n2. ReturnIfAbrupt( O ).\n3. Let lenValue be the result of Get( O, \"length\" ).\n4. Let len be ToUint32( lenValue ).\n5. ReturnIfAbrupt( len ).\n6. If len is 0, return undefined.\n7. If IsCallable( predicate ) is false, throw a TypeError exception.\n8. If thisArg was supplied, let T be thisArg; else let T be undefined\n9. Let k be 0.\n10. Repeat, while k < len\n  a. Let Pk be ToString( k )\n  b.

Let result be the result of calling the [[Call]] internal method of predicate with T as thisArgument and a List containing kValue, k, and O as argumentsList.\n    iv.

Return undefined.\n\nThe length property of the find method is 1.\n\nNOTE The find function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its this value be an Array object. Therefore it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method. Whether the find function can be applied successfully to a host object is implementation-dependent"},{"commentid":3557,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"andrebargull","name":"AndrÃ© Bargull"},"bug_when":"2013-03-28 09:48:07 -0700","thetext":"Are the initial algorithm steps on purpose different from the other Array helper functions?

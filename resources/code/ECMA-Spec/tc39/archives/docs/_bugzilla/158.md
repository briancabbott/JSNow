However, the introductory text to both sections does not make it clear that a new Native Error instance is thrown on each such error occurrence.  In theory, an implementation might interpret this as meaning it only needs to keep a single instance of each Native Error and  reuse it for each required throw. Adding properties to such a common instance might be used as a covert communications channel.\n\n15.11.6 should say: \"A new instance of one of the NativeError objects ...\"\n15.11.7 should say: \"When an ECMASript implementation detects a runtime error it throws a new instance of one of the NativeError...\""},{"commentid":4316,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-06-24 16:46:23 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev 16 editor's draft"},{"commentid":4416,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-07-15 17:03:30 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev16 draft.

For example, 14.1.17 still contains checks for SuperProperty. It seems to me that this can never happen because of the early errors above, and should simply return false. \n\nTherefore, also, 14.1.22 and 14.1.23 need never consult NeedsSuperBinding when giving evaluation rules for these productions."},{"commentid":12939,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"andrebargull","name":"Andr√© Bargull"},"bug_when":"2015-02-18 15:18:13 -0800","thetext":"This should be fixed in rev34 (bug 3963)."},{"commentid":12941,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-02-18 15:32:53 -0800","thetext":"\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 3963 ***"}]}}

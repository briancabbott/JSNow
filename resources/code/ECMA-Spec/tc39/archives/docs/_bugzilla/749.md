Let /pattern/ be the characters comprising the /RegularExpressionBody/\n      of the /RegularExpressionLiteral/.\n   2. Let /flags/ be the characters comprising the /RegularExpressionFlags/\n      of the /RegularExpressionLiteral/.\n   3. Let /rx/ be a new object created as if by the expression\n      new RegExp(/pattern/, /flags/) where RegExp is the standard built-in\n      constructor with that name.\n   4. Return /rx/.\n\nA more direct (and better, in my opinion) alternative for step 3 would be:\n   3. Let /rx/ be the result of the abstract operation RegExpCreate\n      with arguments /pattern/ and /flags/.\n\n(Also, the algorithm is currently in sans-serif, whereas they're normally in a serif font.)"},{"commentid":5960,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-10-22 19:11:41 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev20 editor's draft"},{"commentid":6143,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-10-29 09:46:31 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev20 draft, Oct. 28, 2013"}]}}

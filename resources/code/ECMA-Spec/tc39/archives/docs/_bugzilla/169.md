From my understanding, this should generate a chart of all Test262 Active/Closed bugs from the past ~8 months (i.e., it should be the same as https://bugs.ecmascript.org/chart.cgi?category=Test262&datefrom=2011-01-01&dateto=2011-12-31&label0=All%20Closed&label1=All%20Open&label2=All%20Closed&label3=All%20Open&label4=All%20Closed&label5=All%20Open&line0=60&line1=59&line2=58&line3=57&line4=62&line5=61&name=61&select0=1&select1=1&select2=1&select3=1&select4=1&select5=1&subcategory=Tests&action=assemble).  It does not, and the chart.cgi file (i.e., CSV file) shows no bug counts at all.  Am I doing something wrong with the dataset or is bugzilla broken?\n\nThanks!\n\nDave"}]}}

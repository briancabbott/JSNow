Reading the spec pedantically, the local strictness directive does only apply to the function body, but it is not clear whether that is really the intention.\n\nIf it wasn't, however, and the parameters are supposed to be in strict mode as well, then that would be tricky to implement a single pass parser, because mode-related errors could not be diagnosed directly. This problem is particularly hard due to arrow functions: in general, the parser would not even know when it starts parsing a subexpression with a potentially different language mode:\n\n  'use sloppy';\n  let f = (g = () => { with (x); }) /**/ => { 'use strict' }\n\nUntil we reach the comment, the parser does not know that a different mode might apply to the inner arrow.

With ES6, the problem becomes much more general, and cross-cuts basically all the grammar. It's not just error reporting.

That was just one example, though. I plan to go through the V8 parser tomorrow to get a better overview of what mode-specific code paths there are, and how difficult it would be to defer them.\n\nA more scalable alternative would be to make all non-simple parameter lists implicitly strict. That would widen the kind of semi-strictness we already enforce for them in terms of variable disjointness.\n\nIn either of these options I am yet unsure how well they help for arrow functions."},{"commentid":14595,"comment_count":9,"who":{"uid":"brendan","name":"Brendan Eich"},"bug_when":"2015-08-18 10:26:31 -0700","thetext":"We seemd to agree at the July TC39 meeting to make a non-simple parameter list followed by \"use strict\"; prologue directive at front of the function's body be an early error:\n\n- Make it an error to have a \"use strict\" directive in a function with a non-simple parameter list.\n\n    - Early error\n\n    - No matter what mode you were already in\n\n    - When people want to use local \"use strict\", doing it b/c they want to know that this is always strict, no matter where it ends up. \n\n     - Applies to all kinds of function/generator syntax\n- IsSimpleParameterList http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-function-definitions-static-semantics-issimpleparameterlist\n\nfrom http://oksoclap.com/p/july-29-2015.

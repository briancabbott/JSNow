The former would have involved changing just the one occurrence I noted; the latter would have involved changing every *other* occurrence.\n\nThe occurrence of 'BuiltinArray' in the defn of ArrayCreate is still in a distinct font from its surrounding text, and more such occurrences have been called out, suggesting that you were going for the latter (\"all called-out\") fix. However, many 'BuiltinFoo' values are not called out, so the inconsistency still exists.\n\n(I count about 10 occurrences called out versus about 50 not called-out.)\n\n(Possibly this is a Word vs PDF discrepancy: I'm looking at the PDF.)"},{"commentid":4376,"comment_count":4,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-07-11 17:36:29 -0700","thetext":"we don't use built-in brands at all anymore, but now brand built-ins using double bracketed internal properties so this font issue should now be completely gone.\n\nfixed in rev 16 editor's draft"},{"commentid":4432,"comment_count":5,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-07-15 17:03:40 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev16 draft.

This avoids to perform an additional pass over the parse tree. \n\nAlso:\nIgnoring error messages for now, the order in which the source is parsed and early error detection takes place does not matter, because any error results in a SyntaxError. Well, it does not matter most of the time. The only exception are early ReferenceErrors for code like `0 = 1` or `++0`. Maybe it is possible to change the early ReferenceErrors to early SyntaxErrors?\n\nThere shouldn't be any web-compatibility issues:\n- JavaScriptCore and IE11 do not perform any early error detection for either `++0` or `= 1`\n- SpiderMonkey reports a SyntaxError instead of a ReferenceError for `++0`\n- V8 is compliant for `0 = 1` and `++0`, but erroneously reports a ReferenceError instead of a SyntaxError for `for (0 in o);`"},{"commentid":8531,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-05-16 19:10:00 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev25 editor's draft\n\nwhy does it matter whether \"0 = 1\" is an early Reference Error or an early Syntax Error?

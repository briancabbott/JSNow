The suggested solution using System.get is a very obvious hack. How about the following rule: If a module doesn't have a default export, the default exports defaults to an object with all exports.\n\nE.g. if I have a module \"fs\" that exports many functions but doesn't have a default exports, it should be legal to do either:\n\n```\nimport FS from 'fs';\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\nimport { readFile, createWriteStream } from 'fs';\n```\n\nModules that only export one thing could still use an explicit default export while those with many exports don't have to go for the more verbose:\n\n```\nexport function readFile() {}\nexport function createWriteStream() {}\n\nexport default { readFile, createWriteStream };\n```"},{"commentid":8942,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"arv","name":"Erik Arvidsson"},"bug_when":"2014-06-16 07:36:38 -0700","thetext":"That is a refactor hazard.\n\nIf the module suddenly adds a default export then you get no compile error but things fail at runtime (if you are unlucky it will only fail when your customer wants to pay you)."}]}}

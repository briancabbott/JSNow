I think that this rule would yield the most matches  with the specified lengths of chapter 15 functions when their signatures are rewritten using default-value and rest parameter notation.\n\nSee thread starting at https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/2011-August/016361.html"},{"commentid":6014,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-10-28 16:43:09 -0700","thetext":"this was settle a long time ago"}]}}

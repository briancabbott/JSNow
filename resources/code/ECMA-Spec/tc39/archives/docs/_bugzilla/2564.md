I think you've just picked up the meme that an arrow function is similar to saying:\n  (function () {}.bind(this))\nwhich is actually a pretty low fidelity  analogy. I really don't think we need to say anything about that because I don't think there is anything in the spec. that that equates arrow functions and bound functions in that manner."},{"commentid":9393,"comment_count":4,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-07-19 18:42:53 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev26"}]}}

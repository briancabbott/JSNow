The first of these is in English\nand the second is a form of a syntax diagram.\n\nNeither of these can be considered to be formal or machine-processable.  If\nECMA-404, 1st Edition / October 2013 is to be considered as a definition of\nJSON, it needs to have a normative, machine-processable description of JSON\ntext. \n\n\nThere is even a question as to which of the two descriptions is normative.\nAlthough the two generally agree, at least so far as can be determined for\ninformal descriptions, they differ on strings.\n\nThe English text for strings says that most characters may be placed within\nquotation marks (twice) but is silent on non-characters whereas the syntax\ndiagram indicates that most code points can be placed within quotation\nmarks.  The English text for strings says that only ASCII control characters\nmust be escaped (twice) whereas the syntax diagram says that any control\ncharacter must be escaped.  The English text for strings discusses the\nmeaning of all character escaping sequences whereas the syntax diagram only\ndiscusses the two-character escaping sequences.\n\nThe situation for JSON strings needs to be fixed.  The normative force of\nthe English text versus the syntax diagrams needs to be clarified."}]}}

I'm not aware of anything that implements the latter two as extensions, so I don't particularly care about them (although some policy on this -- I think I remember a bug on the matter -- is probably a good idea).  :-)  But the first is destructuring assignment, which Firefox implements (and which might end up in a future ECMAScript edition), so testing for it throwing a SyntaxError breaks us.\n\nCould the first check, at the very least, be removed from the test?"},{"commentid":316,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"dfugate","name":"Dave Fugate"},"bug_when":"2011-07-18 08:07:06 -0700","thetext":"Yes, FormalParameterListopt in FunctionDeclaration/FunctionExpression could be replaced by an array or something else via ES5's extension clause.

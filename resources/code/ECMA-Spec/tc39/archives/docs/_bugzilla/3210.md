I would argue that this helps simplify the rules around where and when the pseudo-keyword \"let\" is allowed, which are somewhat complicated."},{"commentid":10159,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-09-05 16:14:17 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev28 editor's draft"},{"commentid":10385,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-10-14 15:17:44 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev28"}]}}

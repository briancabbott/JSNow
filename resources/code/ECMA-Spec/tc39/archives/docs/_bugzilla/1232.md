With clear(), someone with _only_ the WeakMap would've been able to affect the WeakMap-and-key-to-value mapping.\"\n\nIf that privacy/security property of Weak{Map, Set} is indeed a desirable feature, it should be specified as a *required* feature. Concretely:\n\n(1) In the intro of Section 23.3 WeakMap [1], it should be added somewhere that no mechanism is provided that would either access or change a key/value pair of a WeakMap without providing both the key and the WeakMap. Ditto for WeakSet. In other words, it should be said that the privacy feature is *intended*.\n\n(2) In Section 16.1 Forbidden Extensions [2], it should be added that conforming implementations must not provide such a mechanism. That would effectively outlaw the `.clear()` method (method that all major implementations currently provide).\n\n[1]: http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-weakmap-objects\n[2]: http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-forbidden-extensions"},{"commentid":10685,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"erights","name":"Mark Miller"},"bug_when":"2014-11-26 07:20:58 -0800","thetext":"Hi Claude, I agree.

Although if this invariant is violated, the invariants defined on getOwnPropertyDescriptor etc. should prevent the proxy from revealing any useful value associated with these \"made-up\" properties.\n\n- As \"ownPropertyKeys\" returns an iterator rather than an array of strings, it's no longer symmetric to getOwnPropertyNames anyway, so I agree with the name change. However, to ensure consistency of user-facing names, either the trap should be named \"ownKeys\" (for consistency with Reflect.ownKeys), or Reflect.ownKeys should be renamed Reflect.ownPropertyKeys."},{"commentid":9236,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-07-17 14:02:15 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev26 editor's draft"},{"commentid":9309,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-07-18 23:27:33 -0700","thetext":"in rev26 draft"}]}}

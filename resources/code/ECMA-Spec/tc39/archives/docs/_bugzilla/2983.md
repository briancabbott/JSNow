It seems none of this can have any other side effect, so order doesn't matter, and you can invoke Create and Instantiate immediately in the same loop\n\n13.2.2.3, 4th case: a variation of step 4 and its substeps for setting \"name\" reappears in various places. It might make sense to factor this out into an algorithm like SetNameIfFunction(value, string)\n\n13.4.1: aren't steps 3 and 4 equivalent to simply returning value?\n\n13.6.1.2: perhaps swap steps 2.b and 2.c\n13.6.2.2: dito with steps 2.f and 2.g\n13.6.3.2, 3rd case, step 9: Is the special-casing of const necessary? Why not simply copy all of the env in CreatePerIterationEnv? AFAICT, the difference is not observable.\n13.6.3.3: perhaps swap steps 4.c and 4.d\n\n13.14.3, step: fold this into BindingInitialization\n\n\nTYPOS & FORMATTING\n\n13.0: weird section numbering?\n13.1.11, Note: \"each block scoped variable, constant or function\" -- or class\n13.2.1, Note: \"[-A] let and const declarations\"\n13.2.2.2, Note: \"This is the case for var statements [+and] formal parameter lists\"\n13.2.2.3, 4th case, Note: \"step 3\" -> \"step 5\"; also, formatting of 'value'\n13.6.1.2, step 1: formatting of 'undefined'\n13.6.2.2, step 1: dito\n13.6.3.2, 3rd case, step 9: \"perI[n]terationList\"\n13.6.4.3, 3rd case: formatting of 'in' in production\n13.11.4, 3rd case, step 3: formatting of DefaultClause"},{"commentid":9133,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-07-07 18:16:38 -0700","thetext":"(In reply to comment #0)\n\n> 13.2.1: there needs to be a definition of VarDeclaredNames for\n> LexicalDeclaration (used via Statement)\n> 13.2.2: dito for VariableStatement\n\nThis was fixed in VariableStatement in rev25\n\nBut, I don't see a path where applying VarDeclaredNames  to Statement can reach a LexicalDeclaration.

I interpreted this as e.g. something like the number 1.1 (mantissa in technical terms) having an exponent of 10, and thus a value of 1.1 to the power of 10, i.e. 2.5937424601. But this is surely not what's meant, and I'm sure the language can be improved to avoid misunderstandings such as the above."}]}}

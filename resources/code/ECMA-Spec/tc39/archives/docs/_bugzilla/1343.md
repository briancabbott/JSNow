Otherwise, findIndex return -1. predicate is called only for elements of the array which actually exist; it is not called for missing elements of the array.\n\n1.

Therefore it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method. Whether the findIndex function can be applied successfully to a host object is implementation-dependent"},{"commentid":3848,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-05-14 10:43:36 -0700","thetext":"added in rev15 editor's draft"},{"commentid":3994,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-05-14 18:14:15 -0700","thetext":"resolved in rev 15, May 14, 2013 draft"}]}}

Compare to String.prototype.match, which (at a point roughly analogous to search's step 7) calls RegExpExec, which goes into great detail about how to apply a regexp to a string.\n\nI understand that 'search' can't call RegExpExec, because RegExpExec *doesn't* ignore the regexp's 'lastIndex' and 'global' properties.

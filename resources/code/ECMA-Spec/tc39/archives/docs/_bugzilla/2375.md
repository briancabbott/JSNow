Yet Section 2 defines conformance purely in terms of whether a sequence of Unicode code points is a valid JSON text.  This is broken because any failure to meet a normative requirement should constitute non-conformance.\n\nPossible fixes are:\n\na) Make the prose in section 9 informative, or\nb) Modify the definition of conformance to say, for example, that a conforming parser must treat equivalent JSON texts identically\n\nI think (b) would be more useful."}]}}

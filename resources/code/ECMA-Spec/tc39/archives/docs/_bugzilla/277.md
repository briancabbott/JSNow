The only respective text is the sentence \"All interpretations of identifiers within this specification are based upon their actual characters regardless of whether or not an escape sequence was used to contribute any particular characters.\"  It is probably intended, but not clear, that this overrides/amends the formal grammar definition.\n\nImplementations differ in their interpretation.

For example, `var var;` wouldn’t work, but e.g. `var v\\u0061r;` would — even though strictly speaking, the ECMAScript spec disallows it. Subsequent use of such identifiers must also have at least one character escaped (otherwise the reserved word will be used instead), but it doesn’t have to be the same character(s) that were originally used to create the identifier. For example, `var v\\u0061r = 42; alert(va\\u0072);` would alert `42`.\n\nThis is documented here: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Web_ECMAScript#Identifiers"},{"commentid":864,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2012-04-12 10:15:45 -0700","thetext":"http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Web_ECMAScript#Identifiers shouldn't be used justify any particular interpretation of the ES specification. There is nothing normative about that document and the section on Identifiers is actually labelled as \"this is very rough\".  Nobody should be making implementation decisions on the basis of that document.\n\nThere may well be web compatibility requirements that are not covered by the current ES5.1 spec. We should try to understand those requirements before implementations start trying to match each others deviations from the spec. Difference between implementations suggest areas where there currently isn't complete interoperability in this area so we shouldn't be creating interoperability among spec. deviations (and future compatibility requirements) unless we actually decide we want those deviations to be part of the standard language.\n\nOn es-discuss Andreas reported that Waldemar told him that keywords are supposed to be recognized before canonicalization.  Waldemar's observation may well be correct for ES<=3. He would know, and if that was the intent then I can see how the spec. could be read in that manner.  But for ES5 we rewrote that portion of the specification and introduced the concept of IdentifierName as a lexical category that includes both ReservedWord and Identifier  and all the escape and canonicalization language was applied to IdentifierName rather than Identifier.  This was all intentional.  We certainly didn't expect true and tru\\u0065 to be recognized as different identifier names in newly allowed contexts such as:\n\n    obj.true == obj.tru\\u0065\n\nI'm pretty sure that no reviewers  brought up issues related to a ES3 interpretation of  unicode escapes as keyword escapes.\n\nAt this point I think we need to do two things:\n\n1) Understand the actual browser interop situation. For example, do all major browsers accept:\n      var tru\\u0065;\n2) Within the constraints of 1) decide what we actually want to specify.  Do we want\n      console.log(fals\\u0065)\nto print \"false\" or \"undefined\"?\n3)  For ES6 we have to decide how \\u{0065} fits in."},{"commentid":1106,"comment_count":3,"who":{"uid":"mathias","name":"Mathias Bynens"},"bug_when":"2012-07-06 06:02:07 -0700","thetext":"To echo the discussion in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=744784:\n\n(In reply to comment #2)\n> At this point I think we need to do two things:\n> \n> 1) Understand the actual browser interop situation.

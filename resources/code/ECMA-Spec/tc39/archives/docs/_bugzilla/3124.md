The only point of contact is that \"\\0\" can either be interpreted as an octal escape sequence in sloppy mode (according to Annex B), or as an ad-hoc escape sequence producing NUL otherwise (per Section 11.8.4)."},{"commentid":9848,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-08-23 12:51:21 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev27 editor's draft"},{"commentid":9971,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-08-25 08:29:31 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev27 draft"}]}}

My program tries to check that the HTML numbering replicates the Word numbering, and it emits warnings if any list items do not match. But I can't make these match as there's apparently no consistent rule. So I have warnings. I can live with them!)"},{"commentid":4783,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-08-06 17:27:37 -0700","thetext":"fixed these specific issues in rev17 editor's draft\n\nadded bug 1734 on cleaning up all the styling of all of the algorithm.

The loader spec needs to set the [[Realm]] property after parsing but it can do this imperatively.\n\nDave"},{"commentid":12856,"comment_count":3,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-02-17 17:30:51 -0800","thetext":"fixed in rev34 editor's draft"},{"commentid":13096,"comment_count":4,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-02-19 19:11:02 -0800","thetext":"fixed in rev34"}]}}

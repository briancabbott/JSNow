[[RegExpMatcher]] in RegExpExec abstract operation). This change is potentially user visible due to the non-standard RegExp.prototype.compile function.\n\nExample:\n---\nvar r = /a/;\nr.lastIndex = {valueOf: function(){ print(\"compile\"); r.compile(\"b\",\"g\") }}; r.exec(\"b\")\n---\n\nV8 and Opera(12.15 - not V8 based) both return `[\"b\"]`, whereas SpiderMonkey returns `null`. (JSC and IE10 don't even execute the valueOf function.)\n\nPer the current ES6 draft, the expected result is `null`."},{"commentid":7276,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-02-12 16:51:03 -0800","thetext":"fixed in rev23 editor's draft\n\nThe fix made for Bug #1575 was apparently revered, but I can't tell why.

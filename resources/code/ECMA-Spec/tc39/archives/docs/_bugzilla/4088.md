So, theoretically, the lexical parser would never yield (e.g.) a BooleanLiteral, it would yield a CommonToken that is an IdentifierName that matched the source characters 't', 'r', 'u', and 'e', say. (It would then be up to the syntactic parser to recognize that as a BooleanLiteral. Again, theoretically.)\n\nWhich is fine with me, I just think it would make a bit more sense if those 5 nonterminals were defined by 1-colon productions."},{"commentid":13388,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-02-26 09:23:45 -0800","thetext":"true, we already did something like this for Identifier.\n\nHowever, I think putting : definitions in clause 11 would be equally confusing.

For example, if P is \"/\", then S could be \"\\/\" or \"\\u002F\", among other possibilities, but not \"/\", because /// followed by F would be parsed as a SingleLineComment rather than a RegularExpressionLiteral. If P is the empty String, this specification can be met by letting S be \"(?:)\".\"\n\nHowever, no browsers appear to have ever agreed with this in at least the following case:\n\nnew RegExp(\"\").source !== \"\"\n\nChanging the behavior of the case above breaks code in at least one place in prototype.js.  \n\nSince this was a new, breaking, requirement in ES5, but has not been implemented in practice, I'd like to suggest removing this requirement."},{"commentid":14760,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"brterlso","name":"Brian Terlson"},"bug_when":"2015-10-03 14:40:16 -0700","thetext":"All browsers seem to implement the spec now from what I can see (RegExp(\"\").source === '(?:)').

But `v` has the value that it had at time of termination of the loop.\n\n-----\n\nHowever, the analog of this semantic does not hold for generators iterated by the `for..of` loop:\n\nfunction* foo() {\n   yield 1;\n   yield 2;\n   yield 3;\n   return 4;\n}\n \nfor (var v of foo()) {\n   console.log(v);\n}\n// 1 2 3\n \nconsole.log(v); // still `3`, not `4` :(\n\n\nI understand why the loop needs to terminate the way that it does. I also understand that the `return 4` isn't technically required to send its value out to a `next(..)` call.\n\nHowever, in the case where we have an implementation that *does* send it out, like the current browser JS engines do, it would be nice if that value could be assigned to the `v` iteration variable **before** the terminating condition (`done:true`) is consulted to stop the loop.\n\nThat way, the final returned value `4` is not thrown away in the `for..of` loop case in the same way that a manual `.next(..)` call (in a supporting browser) would have given you the `4` and not thrown it away.\n\n-----\n\nSince I doubt there's a way (is there?) for `for..of` to tell the difference between a generator which has no `return`, has just `return;` or has `return undefined`, another result of my suggestion is:\n\nfunction* foo() {\n   yield 1;\n   yield 2;\n   yield 3;\n   // no return here!\n}\n \nfor (var v of foo()) {\n   console.log(v);\n}\n// 1 2 3\n \nconsole.log(v); // undefined\n\nIOW, if the generator has no (non-undefined) `return`, the variable `v` would always be `undefined` at the end of the `for..of` loop.\n\nBut I don't think that's such a bad thing, because:\n\n1. Most people will be using `let` anyway, so they wouldn't expect `v` outside the loop.\n2.

I can't imagine there will be any\nsupport to make try-catch a de facto requirement around every for-of loop with\ndestructuring. The other alternative requires to have a matching empty element,\nwhich acts as a dummy value. And depending on the data types, such an element\nmay not even exist.

But I'm pretty sure the answer will be: \"we can't break existing code.\"\n\nOf course, you don't have the same argument against changing `for..of`.\n\nWhat you've proven is that it's \"hard\" (complexity, trade-offs, etc) to do what I'm suggesting. I'll grant that.\n\nWhether it's \"hard\" or not, I think consistency/coherence (in the mental/teachability sense) should be an important goal of designing such mechanisms.\n\nOne conclusion of such problematic design is \"avoid `for..of` iteration if there might be a terminating return value that you care about.\" This is nonsensical, because if I'm just consuming some iterator, how am I supposed to know such a detail?\n\nSo turning the situation around, you could say \"don't design an iterator that returns terminating values\", or even \"terminating return values from iterators should be disallowed\".\n\nThis thread rejects that premise, preserving (and I would argue, endorsing) terminating return values: http://esdiscuss.org/topic/proposal-generator-returning-a-value-should-throw-syntaxerror\n\nSo we're left with \"don't design an iterator with a terminating return value if someone may consume your iterator with a `for..of` loop.\" This is equally nonsensical, because I have no control over how someone consumes my iterator.\n\nIn other words, we're pitting iterator-design against iterator-consumption, and intentionally leaving this footgun gap where if those two don't match, information loss occurs.\n\nI think this intolerable design. But I don't really have any more to say on the topic.

That's certainly true with the current design and their isn't an obvious way to extend for-of, in all of its forms, to expose the return value.  That doesn't seem so bad because if you care about that value you can code the loop in other ways.  For example:\n\nlet itr = collection.values().\nlet next;\nwhile (next=itr.next(), !next.done) {\n   let v = next.value;\n   //loop body\n}\nconsole.log(next.value)  //the return value from the iterator.\n\nHowever, like I said in Comment #5, it may make sense to set the completion value of the for-of statement to the final \"return\" value of the iterator.

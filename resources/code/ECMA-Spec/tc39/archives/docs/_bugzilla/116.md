Has it been deleted anyways? One can assume not, but the spec leaves it implicit.\n\n\nOn Jun 28, 2011, at 9:59 AM, Mark S.

It isn't there and I don't specifically recall it ever being discussed. Because of this I see this more as a change request then a bug that should be listed in the errata.\n\nIf you think such a restriction should be placed on all implementations of [[Delete]] then I suggest that you file a \"normative change from ES5.x\" bug against the next edition [...]"},{"commentid":251,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"brendan","name":"Brendan Eich"},"bug_when":"2011-07-01 14:08:41 -0700","thetext":"8.12.7 seems complete and unambiguous:\n\n8.12.7 [[Delete]] (P, Throw)\n\nWhen the [[Delete]] internal method of O is called with property name P and the Boolean flag Throw, the following steps are taken:\n\n1. Let desc be the result of calling the [[GetOwnProperty]] internal method of O with property name P.\n2. If desc is undefined, then return true.\n3. If desc.[[Configurable]] is true, then\na.

The calling algorithms are also terminated, until an algorithm step is reached that explicitly deals with the exception, using terminology such as “If an exception was thrown…”.

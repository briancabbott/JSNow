Now the\nlength property's value is a string, when it should be a number.\n\nIs that right?\n\nThanks,\n\nMatt Carroll\n_________________________\n\nThis but was introduced in the E5 Spec.  \n\nIt needs to go into the ES5.1 errata."},{"commentid":363,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2011-07-21 09:49:22 -0700","thetext":"corrected in editor's draft"}]}}

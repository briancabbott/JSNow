For example, we would want to change:\n    test262\\external\\contributions\\Google\\sputniktests\\tests\\Conformance\\15_Native_ECMA_Script_Objects\\15.10_RegExp_Objects\\15.10.2_Pattern_Semantics\\15.10.2.10_CharacterEscape\\S15.10.2.10_A1.1_T1.js\n\nto the more succinct:\n    test262\\external\\contributions\\Google\\sputniktests\\tests\\Conformance\\ch15\\15.10\\15.10.2\\15.10.2.10\\S15.10.2.10_A1.1_T1.js\n\nAll I've done here is:\n1. Prepend \"ch\" to the test path (e.g., \"ch\"15)\n2. Remove all alphabetic characters and '_' from all subdirectories of 'test262\\external\\contributions\\Google\\sputniktests\\tests\\Conformance', while retaining all characters in the test filename\n\nThere are a couple of advantages to doing this.  First and foremost, we're cutting the amount of characters needed for the test path in half => smaller test downloads from the live test262 website.  Secondly, this makes us a bit more impervious to any ES5 subsection title changes that might occur in ES6 (e.g., perhaps 15.10.2's \"Pattern Semantics\" changes to \"RegExp Pattern Semantics\").\n\nAny ways, I'd imagine it'd only take half a day or so to write a small script to automatically make these name changes, run it, and check the changes in."},{"commentid":446,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"erights","name":"Mark S.

Also, ietestcenter tests should be changed at the same time from \"chapter15\" to \"ch15\"."},{"commentid":485,"comment_count":3,"who":{"uid":"dfugate","name":"Dave Fugate"},"bug_when":"2011-09-25 21:32:07 -0700"},{"commentid":492,"comment_count":4,"who":{"uid":"dfugate","name":"Dave Fugate"},"bug_when":"2011-10-03 13:46:39 -0700","thetext":"Done.

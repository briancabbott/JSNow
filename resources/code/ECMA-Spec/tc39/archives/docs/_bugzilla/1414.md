I don't really want to add an extra check for that in the internal methods. Instead, I specified for them that  undefined [[StringValue]] is treated as if its value was an empty string.\n\nIt's really up to implementation to decide how to identify uninitiated instances and get their constructor initialization logic to work as specified."},{"commentid":3895,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-05-14 18:13:18 -0700","thetext":"resolved in rev 15, May 14, 2013 draft"}]}}

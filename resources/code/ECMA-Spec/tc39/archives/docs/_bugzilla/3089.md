An implementation-defined succession of the following abstract operations:\n\n  * HasProperty(obj, kString), \n    where kString is the string representation of an integer between 0 and len-1;\n\n  * Get(obj, kString), \n    where kString is the string representation of an integer between 0 and len-1;\n\n  * SortCompare(V, W, comparefn), /* stylistic nit: comparefn is explicit arg */\n    where V and W are values returned by Get(obj, kString) operations;\n\n  * Put(obj, kString, V, true), \n    where kString is the string representation of an integer between 0 and len-1,\n    and where V is a value returned by a Get(obj, kString) operation;\n\n  * DeletePropertyOrThrow(obj, kString), \n    where kString is the string representation of an integer between 0 and len-1.\n    Moreover, that operation is allowed only if at least one call to \n    HasProperty(obj, kString) had returned false.\n\n  Moreover, if any of these operations returns an abrupt completion, \n  the algorithms ends immediately using that abrupt completion as its returned value.\n\n6. Return obj.\n\nTogether with the amendment of SortCompare proposed in Bug #3137, I believe it is what the implementations do today.\n\nThe rest of the section should just give the further requirement that, under reasonable conditions, `obj` must be sorted at the end of the algorithm.

More precisely, the Get and HasProperty operations should be taken away of the SortCompare abstract operation, in order to align with implementations:\n\n* IE and Firefox first do a series the HasProperty/Get operations, then a series of calls to comparefn, each of them followed by a ToNumber operation, then a series of Put/DeletePropertyOrThrow operations. Curiously, IE adds a further series of Get operations at the end of the process.\n\n* Safari, Chrome and Opera have their HasProperty/Get and Put/DeletePropertyOrThrow operations intermingled with their calls to comparefn (followed by ToNumber operation); however, they don't do all the Get operations required by SortCompare(...), but omit some of them when the value is already known from a previous Get operation.\n\nHere is what I used to induce the description above. Further experiment using proxies is needed in order to be sure of when the implementations do HasProperty and (in case of sparse arrays) DeletePropertyOrThrow.\n\n    var a = Array(10)\n    for (var i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {\n        a[i] = Math.floor(Math.random()*900 + 100)\n    }\n\n    var b = Object.defineProperty({}, 'length', {\n        get: function() { console.log('Get(b, \"length\")'); return a.length }\n    })\n    for (var i = 0; i < a.length; i++) (function(i) {\n        Object.defineProperty(b, i, {\n            get: function() { console.log('Get(b, '+i+')'); return a[i] }\n          , set: function(v) { console.log('Put(b, '+i+', '+v+')'); a[i] = v }\n        })\n    })(i)\n\n    function comparefn(a, b) {\n        console.log('comparefn('+a+', '+b+')')\n        return { valueOf: function() { console.log('valueOf()'); return a - b } }\n    }\n\n    ;[].sort.call(b, comparefn)"},{"commentid":9838,"comment_count":5,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-08-21 13:28:58 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev27 editor's draft"},{"commentid":9967,"comment_count":6,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-08-25 08:29:31 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev27 draft"}]}}

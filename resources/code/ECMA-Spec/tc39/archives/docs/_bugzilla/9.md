However, the introductory text to both sections does not make it clear that a new Native Error instance is thrown on each such error occurrence.  In theory, an implementation might interpret this as meaning it only needs to keep a single instance of each Native Error and  reuse it for each required throw. Adding properties to such a common instance might be used as a covert communications channel.\n\n15.11.6 should say: \"A new instance of one of the NativeError objects ...\"\n15.11.7 should say: \"When an ECMASript implementation detects a runtime error it throws a new instance of one of the NativeError...\""},{"commentid":584,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2012-01-12 12:27:16 -0800","thetext":"set IN_PROGRESS to indicated this should go into ES5.1 Errata."},{"commentid":14726,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"brterlso","name":"Brian Terlson"},"bug_when":"2015-10-02 14:33:00 -0700","thetext":"Bulk resolving ES5.1 errata issues as a sampling suggests these are all fixed.

The only respective text is the sentence \"All interpretations of identifiers within this specification are based upon their actual characters regardless of whether or not an escape sequence was used to contribute any particular characters.\"  It is probably intended, but not clear, that this overrides/amends the formal grammar definition.\n\nImplementations differ in their interpretation. For example,\n\nv\\u0061r x = 0\neval(\"v\\\\u0061r y = 1\")\n\nIs accepted by FF 10, rejected by V8 3.8, and JSC seems to reject the former but accepts the latter. Conversely,\n\nvar v\\u0061r = 1\neval(\"var v\\\\u0061r = 2\")\n\nis rejected by FF but accepted by V8 (actually introducing a variable named \"var\")."}]}}

That would be a shame as the function form can be trivially polyfilled while the operator form cannot (without transpiling)."},{"commentid":3274,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-03-05 16:49:45 -0800","thetext":"fixed in rev 14 editor's draft"},{"commentid":3344,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-03-08 14:44:18 -0800","thetext":"in Rev 14 draft"}]}}

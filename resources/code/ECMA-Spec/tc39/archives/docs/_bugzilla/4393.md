When Object is called as a function rather than as a constructor, it performs a type conversion.\n\nThat description is confusing as it makes a nonexistent distinction between invocation as constructor and as function. Moreover, when you invoke it as constructor passing, e.g., an exotic Array as argument, the resulting object is neither new, nor ordinary in contradicting the aforementioned description.\n\n\nPossible reformulation:\n\n    The Object constructor behaves the same way when called as a function or as a constructor. When called with no argument or when used as a super-constructor, it creates a new object. Otherwise, it converts its argument to an object."}]}}

It would be good to clarify this.\n\nYou can also reduce the number of cases where confusion might arise:\n\n    Change \">=\" to \"≥\" in:\n        10.6 / alg 1 / step 4\n        10.6 / alg 2 / step 7\n        15.13.7.4 / alg 1 / step 4\n        15.13.7.4 / alg 2 / step 4\n\n    Change \"==\" to \"=\" (or \"equals\") in:\n        15.8.2.13 / bullets 7,8\n        15.9.1.12 / step 7\n        15.10.2.6 / IsWordChar / step 1\n        15.10.2.8 / CharacterSetMatcher / steps 1.2, 1.5a, 1.6a\n\n    Change \"!==\" to \"≠\" in:\n        15.13.6.2.1 / step 2.d.vii\n\n(Actually, \"==\" and \"!==\" aren't conventional mathematical operators, but I'm still guessing they aren't meant to be invocations of ECMAScript operators.)"},{"commentid":1991,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2012-10-24 08:58:59 -0700","thetext":"correct in rev 11 editor's draft"},{"commentid":2183,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2012-10-26 15:34:31 -0700","thetext":"in October 26, 2012 release draft"}]}}

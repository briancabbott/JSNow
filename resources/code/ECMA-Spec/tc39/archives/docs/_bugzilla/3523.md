Remove step 6.c.iv and replace it with the following:\n\n    6.d. If Type(C) is Object, then\n        1. Let C be Get(C, @@species).\n        2. ReturnIfAbrupt(C).\n\n\n(An interesting feature of that patch is that it becomes easy for a user-defined Array subclass to avoid the realm check:\n\n    class MyArray extends Array { /* ... */ }\n    MyArray.prototype.constructor = { [Symbol.species]: MyArray }\n\n)"},{"commentid":11356,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"claude.pache","name":"Claude Pache"},"bug_when":"2015-01-15 03:48:34 -0800","thetext":"In Comment 0, read \"constructor\" instead of @@constructor."},{"commentid":11405,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-01-15 13:25:05 -0800","thetext":"fixed in rev31 editor's draft"},{"commentid":11441,"comment_count":3,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-01-15 16:19:04 -0800","thetext":"In Rev31"}]}}

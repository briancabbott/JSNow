Let formalStatus be the result of performing Binding Initialisation\nfor formals with ao and undefined as arguments.\n\nBut, ao.[[Get]], ao.[[GetOwnProperty]] have been already overriden to\nmapped arguments special internal methods in non-strict function.\n\nFor example,\n\nfunction test(a) { }\ntest(10);\n\nIn this script, we perform Indexed Binding Initialisation and finally, we\nperform ao.[[Get]]('a').\nBut, in this phase, 'a' entry of environmental record is initialized to\nundefined in 10.5.3-5-c-ii-1, so ao's getter defined in\nCreateMappedArgumentsObject step 7-c-ii-2,\n\nfunction () { return a; }\n\nalways returns undefined.\nAs the result, ao.[[Get]] result is always undefined, and we cannot\ninitialize argument by correct value.\n\nTo fix this, I suggest creating JS Array from argumentsList and performing\nBinding Initialisation with it, or delaying internal method override phase\nof ao."},{"commentid":2077,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2012-10-25 18:54:16 -0700","thetext":"corrected in rev 11 editor's draft"},{"commentid":2120,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2012-10-26 15:34:13 -0700","thetext":"in October 26, 2012 release draft"}]}}

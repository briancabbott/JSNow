This was true in non-strict mode, this isn't anymore in strict mode for which I don't know how to retrieve the global object.\n\nIn general, I think that all tests attempting to test something on host objects should be removed. As said in ES5.1 8.6.2, \"Every object (including host objects) must implement all of the internal properties listed in Table 8.\". However, there is no constraint whatsoever in what should/should not happen with these implementation. There is at most a hope that host objects will roughly behave like native objects do, but that hope isn't testable.\n\nTest regarding 'window' or 'document' had better being in a WebIDL (http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/) or DOM test suite.\nThe ActiveXObject has never been part of any standard I'd be aware of."},{"commentid":27,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"bruant.d","name":"David Bruant"},"bug_when":"2011-02-12 02:02:09 -0800","thetext":"As said here (https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es5-discuss/2011-February/003920.html), to retrieve the global object in an standard and interoperable way, you can do the following:\n\nvar o = Function(\"return this\")();\n\nWorks in strict and non-strict mode as far as I can tell.

I don't think\n> so...\nWhat do you mean by \"Array type\"?\n- Since the global object is an object, typeof globalObject === \"object\" stands as a language invariant (it could actually be a test to add).\n- Based on what is written in 15.1 \"The values of the [[Prototype]] and [[Class]] internal properties of the global object are implementation-dependent.\", we could imagine an implementation in which: [[Class]] be equal to \"Array\" which would make that \"Array.isArray(globalObject) === true\" and [[Prototype]] could be the native Array.prototype object which would make that \"globalObject instanceOf Array === true\".\n\nSo, my answer to your question is: yes, it could be of \"Array type\", but that's implementation-dependent so that shouldn't be considered in a test.\n\nI cannot find most of the tests you mention.

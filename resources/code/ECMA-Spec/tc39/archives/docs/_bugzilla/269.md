This is obviously not right as function declarations need to have an identifier. \n\nIn addition to that, the tests are invalid as well. According to the note in \"ES5.1 - 12 Statements\", it's only recommended to prohibit function declarations as statements. Therefore the tests should rather be moved into the \"bestPractice\" directory and additionally set to strict-mode-only execution per [1].\n\n\n[1] http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=conventions:no_non_standard_strict_decls"},{"commentid":645,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"andrebargull","name":"André Bargull"},"bug_when":"2012-02-21 18:25:14 -0800","thetext":"Also applies to S12.5_A9_T3"},{"commentid":669,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"dfugate","name":"Dave Fugate"},"bug_when":"2012-02-24 14:30:10 -0800","thetext":"Fixed in Hg.

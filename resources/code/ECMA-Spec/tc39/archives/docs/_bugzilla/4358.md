Disjunction )\" evaluate to a matcher. \nTherefore, this section should start with something like \"if Assertion evaluates to a Matcher closure, return that Matcher closure\""},{"commentid":14391,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-05-07 09:03:53 -0700","thetext":"This appears to be a bug that has existed since ES5 yet this is the first time it has been reported.\n\nBecause of the nature of this bug, I think it is best to not try to rush a fix into ES6 at this late stage.  Instead, I'm going to transfer it to ES7 so it can be addressed in the first yearly update to ES6."}]}}

The minor differences are:\n\n* One should make sure that the assertion found at step 1 of GetMethod is verified;\n* `null` will treated the same way as `undefined`;\n* if a value that is neither undefined/null nor a function is found, the corresponding TypeError will be thrown immediately, rather than at the time the GetIterator(...) operation will be (almost inevitably) called."},{"commentid":11139,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-12-23 10:05:39 -0800","thetext":"fixed in rev30 editor's draft"},{"commentid":11174,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-12-23 20:23:28 -0800","thetext":"fixed in rev30"}]}}

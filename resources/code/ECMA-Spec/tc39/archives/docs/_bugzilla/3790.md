This combines the notation used in the ES language specifications, \"[optional]\", with the new notation for use in ES6 programs, \"optional = undefined\", and is redundant. The value undefined for optional arguments in built-in functions is specified by ES6 section 17.\n\nI suggest reverting to the notation used in the ES language specifications, \"[optional]\"."},{"commentid":12238,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"ecmascriptbugs","name":"Norbert"},"bug_when":"2015-02-08 20:53:45 -0800","thetext":"Sorry, part of what I wrote in the description was wishful thinking: ES6 section 17 specifies undefined as the value if *required* arguments are not provided; it doesn't say anything about optional arguments.\n\nHowever, I don't see the language spec saying what the spec notation \"[optional = undefined]\" means, and I also don't see it used anywhere. So I think it's better to revert to the old way of filling in argument values as part of the algorithms."},{"commentid":12241,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"waldron.rick","name":"Rick Waldron"},"bug_when":"2015-02-09 08:25:00 -0800","thetext":"It replaced any algorithm text that had previously explicitly set those to `undefined` if the value argument wasn't present.

There needs to be something in the specs that says what happens when the caller doesn't provide an optional argument. Contrary to what I claimed in the description of this bug, ES6 section 17 doesn't specify that. So we need the steps that the algorithms had in ECMA-402 first edition."},{"commentid":12895,"comment_count":4,"who":{"uid":"waldron.rick","name":"Rick Waldron"},"bug_when":"2015-02-18 06:41:14 -0800","thetext":"That's what I was using the default parameter for; in those \"not provided\" cases, the value was set to `undefined`, then the algorithm would proceed.

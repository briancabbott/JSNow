Specifically (changes with <del>deletion</del> and <ins>insertion</ins>):\n\nIn the second NOTE make the following changes: \"This function is intended to rely on whatever language-sensitive comparison functionality is available to the ECMAScript environment from the host environment, and to compare according to the ruls of the host environment's current locale. It is <del>strongly recommended</del> <ins>required</ins> that this function treat strings that are canonically equivalent according to the Unicode standard as identical <del>(in other words, compare the strings as if they had both been converted to Normalised Form C or D first)</del>. It is also recommended that this function not honour Unicode compatibility equivalences or decompositions. <ins>For a definition and discussion of canonical equivalence see the Unicode Standard, chapters 2 and 3, as well as <a href=\"http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/\">UAX #15</a> Unicode Normalization Forms and <a href=\"http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn5/\">UTN #5</a> Canonical Equivalence in Applications.

Note that canonical equivalence has nothing to do with language sensitivity - it's a core feature of the Unicode Standard that makes up for the fact that compatibility with legacy character encodings required Unicode to occasionally provide two different encodings for what humans would consider the same character."},{"commentid":9723,"comment_count":4,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-08-07 16:27:02 -0700","thetext":"fixed again in rev27 editor's draft\n\nmade canonically equivalent comparison mandatory and  eliminated all normative mentions of host environment capabilities. \n\nRationale:  since we require an implementation to provide String.prototype.normalize is isn't really an extra burden to require this function to do canonically equivalent comparison."},{"commentid":9920,"comment_count":5,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-08-25 08:29:25 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev27 draft"},{"commentid":10695,"comment_count":6,"who":{"uid":"ecmascriptbugs","name":"Norbert"},"bug_when":"2014-12-01 20:22:54 -0800","thetext":"Very nice - thank you!\n\nVerified in rev 28 draft."}]}}

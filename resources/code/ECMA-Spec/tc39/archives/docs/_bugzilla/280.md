The \"285,426\" number in [15.9.1.1] is slightly lower, I guess due to additional leap year calculation.\nFor an approximation \"285,616\" seems to be the better choice. But at least the numbers should be consistent within the specification. \n\nConcerning 2)\nECMAScript does not require to specify \"approx. 285,426 years\" but instead only requires from implementations to support ±100,000,000 days from midnight 01/01/1970. So the theoretical limit of double precision floating point numbers shouldn't actually appear in [15.9.1.15.1], instead the actual range ±100,000,000 days should be used. That also means the \"Examples of extended years\" part needs to be updated to use date values which are actually supported."}]}}

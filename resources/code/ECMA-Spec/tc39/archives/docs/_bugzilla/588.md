While normal array-like iteration skips holes. I would expect that\n\nlet a2 = Array.from([,,,,5]);\n\nwould produce a new array that was just like the argument array.  But using iterator protocol would make it just like:\n\nlet a3 = Array.from[undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, 5]);\n\nIt seems to me that the right solution, is that if the from argument is a real Array then Array-like, hole preservation, iteration should be used.  If it isn't a real Array, then from should first try iterable protocol and if it isn't there fall back to array-like."}]}}

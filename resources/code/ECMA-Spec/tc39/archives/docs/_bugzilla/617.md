This will be a part one because I don't think I'll manage to copy everything in one go.\n\nWill use backticks for code, double quotes for quoting. p2 = paragraph two (etc) and is relative to the page (not section/header).\n\nPage number; approximate position; quote; comment\n\n\n3; 4.2.1 line 2; \"literal notation\"; make this bold too (consistent with \"constructors\" being bold)\n\n3; p5; \"implicit\"; it's (going to be) explicitly exposed through `__proto__`, when that happens this sentence should probably adjusted accordingly\n\n3; p5; \"prototype chain\"; isn't this \"prototypal chain\"?\n\n3; 4.2.1 figure 1; this really needs fixing. Even knowing exactly what it does I don't think this clearly represents prototypal inheritance. I'm sure we can create a better example?

Just to clarify that this is in fact a terminal symbol. In most cases the fixed with font is sufficient, but sometimes (especially in one or two character cases), it's not.\n\nFun fact; the first time I read the spec (a few years ago) it really took me a few pages to realize that \"terminal symbol\" did not refer to a (keyboard) character entered in a console (terminal). Even with all the parser theory and p5 specifically, this fact was not at first clear to me.

This is partially a bikeshed, but also might help in some cases where the production names and opt sub is literally quoted in regular text. The \"opt\" sub sometimes looks odd to me in such cases. And it's shorter, so that counts too... ;)\n\nNothing on page 10!\n\nWill continue this.

Yes, that \"undefined\" was intentional - while NaN is what charCodeAt returns, I consider that a bug, because NaN is not a valid code point or code unit, and the normal convention in ECMAScript is to return undefined when a client asks for something that doesn't exist.\n\n(3) remove \"(leftmost)\". We're not talking about rendering here, and which element is rendered leftmost depends on the element sequence within the string as well as the context in which it is rendered.\n\n(4) do we need the complicated explanation of indexing in this step anyway?

Parse /sourceText/ using /Module/ as the goal symbol and analyze the parse\n     result for any Early Error conditions. If the parse was successful and no\n     early errors were found, let /body/ be the resulting parse tree. Otherwise,\n     let /errors/ be an indication of one or more parsing errors and/or early\n     errors.\n  3. If /errors/ is an abrupt completion or error indication, then\n        ...\n\nUnusually for this spec, step 2 names two metavariables, but any given execution of the step will bind a value to only one of them. So when step 3 refers to the\n/errors/ metavariable, it might not even be defined. (Everywhere else, I would take this as a bug in the spec, but here it's presumably intentional.)\n\nSection 15.1.9 (ScriptEvaluationJob) has a step with parallel wording, but there it introduces just one metavariable, which is either bound to a parse tree or an error-indication as appropriate. The subsequent step can then refer to that variable without the chance that it's not defined.\n\nI suggest using 15.1.9's approach in 15.2.1.16.1.\n\nFor the name of the single metavariable, I'd suggest the neutral /parseResult/."},{"commentid":12795,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-02-16 17:19:00 -0800","thetext":"fixed in rev34 editor's draft\n\nI used \"body\" as the name of the single variable, as it is only in step 3 that that it may be anything other than the parse tree of the module body."},{"commentid":12798,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"jmdyck","name":"Michael Dyck"},"bug_when":"2015-02-16 18:39:52 -0800","thetext":"(In reply to Allen Wirfs-Brock from comment #1)\n> \n> I used \"body\" as the name of the single variable, as it is only in step 3\n> that that it may be anything other than the parse tree of the module body.\n\nYup, that's reasonable.\n\n(Although technically, because sourceText is parsed as a Module, it might make more sense to call it /module/.

Presumably these were treated separately in the past because a CV was meant to be exactly one character or code unit (thought to be the same in the past). This wasn't quite correct because some CVs were actually empty sequences. With the introduction of the two-code-unit sequences necessary for supplementary characters a CV yet more looks like a string.\n\nI recommend getting rid of CVs and explaining string value generation entirely in terms of SVs."},{"commentid":11011,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-12-11 11:08:08 -0800","thetext":"fixed in rev30 editor's draft"},{"commentid":11150,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-12-23 20:23:24 -0800","thetext":"fixed in rev30"},{"commentid":12355,"comment_count":3,"who":{"uid":"ecmascriptbugs","name":"Norbert"},"bug_when":"2015-02-11 22:09:33 -0800","thetext":"Verified fixed in rev 32 draft."}]}}

Now we and JavaScript are in a world of free and open source software [2], the existing state of affairs must be changed. Ecma International may be worrying about the integrity of the standard, however there are three alternatives:\n    1. They can permit making changes to it as long as the modified versions are not distributed as the official standards;\n    2. They can use trademark and set a policy restricting the use of their name and standard names;\n    3. They may ignore the issue altogether. Why worry about it? JavaScript is supposed to be open source.\n\nIn short, the ECMAScript official specification should be distributed under either the Creative Commons [3] Attribution license version 2.5 or the Open Web Foundation [4] License Agreement version 1.0.\n\nPart of the free culture and free software movements.\n\n\n[1]: http://freedomdefined.org/\n[2]: http://www.fsf.org/\n[3]: http://creativecommons.org/\n[4]: http://www.openwebfoundation.org/"},{"commentid":7816,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-04-18 11:50:52 -0700","thetext":"This is an issue for Ecma International management and its General Assembly.\n\nYou should take it up with them.\n\nAlso see http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/Ecma%20copyright%20FAQ.htm"}]}}

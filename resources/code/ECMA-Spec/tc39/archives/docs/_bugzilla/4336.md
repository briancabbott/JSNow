Is it just down to Section 8? http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-lexical-environments Allen changed it to the right version. \n\nI read the ECMAScript specifation insomuch as doing so is necessary to maintain the desired level of professional skill and integrity. \n\nTo be fair, I haven't applied the right amount of time and concentration to sit down and study the new way that Declaration Binding Instatiation Variable Instantionation, is now defined.\n\nAlternate courses of education include topics of war, banking, globalization, social psychology (a tool of the global elite), health and food/medicine. Arriving at valauble truths in these subjects, on a larger scale, is time consuming. \n\nThere are also things that I must do on my own, such as laundry, personal organization, phone calls, hygeine, paperwork, and buying things (like toilet paper, ginger, etc). \n\nPersonal aspirations forgone.\n\nAlthough my time is currently not overly constrained by occupational garbage (work), the opporunity cost of grokking the spec is greater than reading about the other aforementioned things, which are more useful and more important. But if the spec were easier to read, the cost of reading it would be lower, and it would be more worth it."},{"commentid":14767,"comment_count":4,"who":{"uid":"brterlso","name":"Brian Terlson"},"bug_when":"2015-10-03 18:56:09 -0700","thetext":"No longer applies to ES6."}]}}

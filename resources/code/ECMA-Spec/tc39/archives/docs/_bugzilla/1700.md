Let O be this Date object.\n    2. If Type(O) is not Object, then throw a TypeError exception.\n\nBut how can the condition in step 2 be true? The phrase \"this Date object\" is defined (in 15.9.4) to be an object, and all other references to \"this Date object\" assume it to be so (i.e., they set or get its internal properties without first checking that it's an object). So either this type-check is redundant, or there are a bunch of other places that need to add a type-check."},{"commentid":4750,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-08-05 17:18:06 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev17 editor's draft"},{"commentid":5113,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-08-23 08:22:52 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev17, August 23, 2013 draft"}]}}

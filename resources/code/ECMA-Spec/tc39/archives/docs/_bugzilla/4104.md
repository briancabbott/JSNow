A \"constructor function\" (or just \"constructor\") is a function object that also supports [[Construct]].\n\nadded these definition to 6.1.7.2 innediately before Table 6\n\n9.2 is about \"ECMAScript function objects\" which are function objects whose behavior are defined using ECMASript source code.\n> \n> *   `%Function%`, `Function constructor object`, `Function`(fix width, bold\n> font) are built-in objects and referenced to the same thing.\n\nNot quite. `Function constructor` (usually with Function in fixed width font)  and `Function` (Always in fixed width font) mean the same thing and refer to  any instance of the built-in object defined in 19.2.1.\n\n%Function% is specifically the Function constructor associated with the current Realm. \n\nI couldn't find any occurrences of `Function constructor object`\n\nFixed several places where Function should be fixed-width font\n\n> \n> *   `Function object` is a `function object`, which is created by `new\n> Function(..)` expression.\n> \n> B.2.4.3 The Function object that is the initial value\n> Date.prototype.toGMTString is the same Function object that is the initial\n> value Date.prototype.toUTCString... \n> \n> Should `Function object` changed to `function object`?\n\nyes, fixed this any serval other places where F should be f."},{"commentid":13535,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-03-04 18:58:21 -0800","thetext":"fixed in rev35"}]}}

These are not mentioned in section 3 of UTS 35, but show up in the bcp47 data files. They seem inappropriate as identifiers, and so should not be processed as such. Edition 1.0 of the ECMAScript Internationalization API specifies to ignore them. In a future edition, we could accept them in requests but canonicalize them to actual numbering system identifiers for format and resolvedOptions."}]}}

For Map, it's lines 2-4 of 23.1.1.1.  The recorded consensus was just ratifying what was already in the spec.\n\nThe motivation is that it's really hard (particularly in pure JS code) to write a constructor function that works correctly as both a factory function (called without new) and as an instance initializer (particularly when super called).  It's cleaner and simpler to not have the factory behavior for constructor functions and to have them act only as instance initializers. In ES6 the only built-in constructors that work as both factories and initializers are those where this is a legacy compatability requirement."},{"commentid":8425,"comment_count":3,"who":{"uid":"waldron.rick","name":"Rick Waldron"},"bug_when":"2014-05-14 12:45:49 -0700","thetext":">  For Map, it's lines 2-4 of 23.1.1.1. \n\nBut aren't those conditions satisfied?

The constructor then validates that the object has those internal slots.\n\n> \n> \n> I recall the motivation, as I was in support of this change prior to the f2f\n> and the recorded notes—this was a conversation Erik and I had several months in\n> advance of the meeting."},{"commentid":8444,"comment_count":5,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-05-14 14:35:11 -0700","thetext":"(In reply to comment #3)\n> >  For Map, it's lines 2-4 of 23.1.1.1. \n> \n> But aren't those conditions satisfied?

However, ES5 forgot to do so for built-in functions, and some allowed implementations in the past were not practically securable for this reason: they had the old magic behavior *and* were not deletable.\n\nThere's another leak as well: [[Get]] on non-strict functions were specified not to reveal a strict caller.

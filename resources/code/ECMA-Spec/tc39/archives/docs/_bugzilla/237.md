Are they different in any significant way? A measurable consequence of this is that \"list\"s don't get cross-linked to the Link, a specification type, in the annotated spec on GitHub. Both of them even occur in the same section. [1]\n\nOr are they different? If that's the case, I guess the definition of \"List\" is sort of unclear though I am sure.\n\nWhy does the spec have \"List\" at the first place? It seems to be too frequently used. If the idea is to tag certain internal variables as related to argument list then I guess it would be better if it's not used in unrelated context.\n\n[1] http://es5.github.com/#x15.2.3.7"}]}}

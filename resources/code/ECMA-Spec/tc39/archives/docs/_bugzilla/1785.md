Set the bound value for N in envRec to V.\n> b.  Record that the binding for N in envRec has been initialised.\n\n- 'envRec' is a Global Environment Record in this case, it's not clear what \"bound value for N in envRec\" means, should this just call \"ObjRec’s InitialiseBinding concrete method\"? \n- and it's also not clear how to record that the binding has been initialised. Remove this step?\n\n\nAnd finally, the preamble says an \"uninitialised binding for N must already exist\", but if no such binding exists (HasBinding for DclRec and ObjRec both return false) no further action is taken. Maybe throw an error?"},{"commentid":4933,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-08-16 10:54:50 -0700","thetext":"see bug 1782\n\nfixed in rev17 editor's draft"},{"commentid":5084,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-08-23 08:22:35 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev17, August 23, 2013 draft"}]}}

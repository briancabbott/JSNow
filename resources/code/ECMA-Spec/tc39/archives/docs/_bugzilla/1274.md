The most recent draft of the second edition of ECMA-402 has specifications for them:\nhttp://norbertlindenberg.com/ecmascript/intl.html#sec-13.1.2\n\n-- The spec for Array.prototype.toLocaleString shows the optional arguments, requires that an implementation with the internationalization API \"must implement the Array.prototype.toLocaleString method as specified in the ECMA-402 specification\", but notes that \"the first edition of ECMA-402 did not include a replacement specification\". The  most recent draft of the second edition still does not.\n\n-- The spec for Object.prototype.toLocaleString shows the optional arguments, notes that they \"are not used but may be passed by inplementations that include ECMA-402 support\" and that ECMA-402 \"intentionally does not provide an alternative to this default implementation\". That reflects the outcome of a discussion on es-discuss, but hasn't been confirmed by the internationalization ad-hoc yet. The spec also stutters \"the the\".\n\n-- The spec for %TypedArray%.prototype.toLocaleString states that its initial value \"is the same built-in function object as the Array.prototype.toLocaleString method\". This sounds about right, but it's not immediately clear that the elements will have Number.prototype.toLocaleString called on them.\n\nThis needs to be looked at again together with bug 1260, bug 573, and bug 2383."},{"commentid":13737,"comment_count":4,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-03-15 12:47:08 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev36 editor's draft"},{"commentid":13811,"comment_count":5,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-03-17 16:57:04 -0700","thetext":"in rev36"}]}}

The behavior demonstrated by V8, Spidermonkey, and Chakra is to return the empty string for cycles, thus returning the result '1,2,3,'. This behavior is unspecified and an equally valid result would be to throw a recursion error.\n\nFor comparison, JSON.stringify explicitly specifies how to handle cycles (throw an error)."}]}}

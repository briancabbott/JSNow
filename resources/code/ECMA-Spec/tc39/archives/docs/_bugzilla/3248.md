Javascript is very good and flexible language, but it has some performance issues. If it'll have static typed system issues will reduce. Many people wanna this, so were created a lot of languages that compiling to js, but with static typed system: typescript, dart, etc. Also Mozilla introduced new project named `asm.js` (asmjs.org), but it's created on hack as I think. I think it could be something like this specification: http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:types&s=static+types"},{"commentid":10676,"comment_count":1,"who":"impinball","bug_when":"2014-11-23 22:41:33 -0800","thetext":"@Roman It largely is, but mainly to provide backwards compatibility with engines that don't recognize the types (only Firefox properly optimizes specifically for it).

In the future there will likely be new tickets opens for specific feature work"}]}}

For example, Google Docs implements a complete text editing framework.\n\nThis is extremely difficult in JS currently, yet every modern OS has support for the low-level APIs that make it efficient and practical. These include the ability to find the width of a string, but also the ability to find out where cursor positions would be, etc. Should include support for BIDI positioning also."},{"commentid":1990,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"ecmascriptbugs","name":"Norbert"},"bug_when":"2012-10-23 23:11:13 -0700","thetext":"Text editing support is beyond the scope of TC 39, and should be proposed to a W3C working group instead.

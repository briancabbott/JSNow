However, looking at it now I don't see any compelling reason to not have them.\n\nRelated is the more general question of what should happen when the property doesn't exist in the source object. As currently specified undefine is used as the source value for the LHSExpression. A reasonable alternative would be to skip that LHS entirely.  EG:\n\nvar a=1,b=2;\n{a,b} ={ a:3};\n\nconsole.log(a,b); //current spec:  3, undefined\n                  //reasonable alternative:  3, 2\n\nWhich makes more sense?"},{"commentid":1018,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2012-06-16 09:43:15 -0700","thetext":"fixed in \"Rev 8\", June 12,2012 draft"}]}}

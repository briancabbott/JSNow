After taking the time to thoroughly research this, ES5.1 states:\n1. Object.defineProperty ends up calling 15.4.5.1\n2. Step 3.a.i of 15.4.5.1 ends up calling 8.12.9\n3. 8.12.9 states that a transition from Writable===true to Writable===false on a non-configurable property is actually OK\n\nSpent two hours second-guessing this and looking for a flaw in either 8.12.9 *or* my interpretation, but there is none.  ES5.1 actually allows Writable properties to become non-Writable when the property is non-Configurable!  \n\nI've filed a bug for Table 5 of ES5.1 to be fixed - see https://bugs.ecmascript.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100."}]}}

This restriction is because Ecma wants to preserve the integrity of the standard. However, there are much better way to do this:\n\n    1. Ecma may permit distributing modified versions of the specification, as long as the modified copies do not claim to be the official standard (see the Haskell and ISLISP specifications);\n    2. Ecma may trademark it's name and enact trademark policies that prohibit using it's name in anything other than the official standard;\n    3. Or Ecma may stop caring about the issue altogether. (Works with Scheme, F#, Lua, Squirrel, Rust, Ruby [they don't have an official specification, but it is neither that \"Ruby\" is trademarked nor that the copyright license prohibits making changes that keep the name],...) /* the most prevalent case, as far as I know */"},{"commentid":14711,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"brterlso","name":"Brian Terlson"},"bug_when":"2015-10-01 16:06:04 -0700","thetext":"Looks like there have been some changes to this license text since this issue was filed.

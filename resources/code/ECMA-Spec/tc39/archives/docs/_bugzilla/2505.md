Actually there's another caveat which may be worthwhile to document: \n\nIn addition to the `prototype` object, an implementation must also ensure to create a new variable environment (not only a new lexical environment!) for the generator comprehension. This is currently only implicitly specified due to the use of a GeneratorFunction object to implement the generator comprehension semantics.\n\n\nTest case:\n---\nfunction outer() {\n  var x = 0;\n  function inner() {\n    // The direct eval creates a new var-binding in the variable environment\n    // of the generator comprehension, not in the variable environment\n    // of the 'inner' function\n    var r = (for (x of [0]) (eval(\"var x = 1\"), x)).next().value;\n    return [x, r];\n  }\n  return inner();\n}\nouter(); // returns [0, 1]\n---"},{"commentid":8360,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-05-12 18:09:44 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev25 editor's draft\n\nAdded to 12.2.7.2 note as suggested. \n\nCreated bug 2853 relating to the legality of that particular eval."},{"commentid":8918,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-06-12 15:22:27 -0700","thetext":"in rev25"}]}}

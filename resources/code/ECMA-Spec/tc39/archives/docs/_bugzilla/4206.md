It does not describe a 'name' property.\n\nThe spec introduces a `name` property for Function instances, and I can see no reason for GeneratorFunction instances to not also define this property. Additionally, the change log for Revision 20 (October 28, 2013) states:\n\n> Added name property for functions created via function/generator/class\n> declarations or binding initializers and assignment.\n\n...but the change markup for that revision [1] only introduces the `name` property for Function instances (not GeneratorFunction instances).\n\n[1] http://wiki.ecmascript.org/lib/exe/fetch.php?id=harmony%3Aspecification_drafts&cache=cache&media=harmony:working_draft_ecma-262_edition_6_10-28-13-rev20markup.pdf"},{"commentid":14010,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-04-02 06:43:27 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev37 editor's draft"},{"commentid":14084,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-04-03 12:35:36 -0700","thetext":"In Rev37"}]}}

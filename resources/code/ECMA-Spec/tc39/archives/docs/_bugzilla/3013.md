It includes a property `.module` set in 15.2.5.6 LinkDynamicModules.  This property has the properties of a \"Module Instance Object\" which is not defined in the spec, but seem to be the type that should be returned by `newModule()`.  In other words, \"[[Module]].module\" isA Module.\n\nChanging the definition above to \"The ModuleLinkage record produced by this load or undefined\" would help a bit. Changing [[Module]] to [[ModuleLinkage]] would help dramatically. Then we could say \"[[ModuleLinkage]].module isA Module\"."},{"commentid":10324,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-10-11 17:39:31 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev28 editor's draft"},{"commentid":10490,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-10-14 15:18:03 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev28"}]}}

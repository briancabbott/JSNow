For example see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_epsilon \n\nSince this value is a very small fractional floating point value it isn't clear that base 2 would make things much clearer.  It sounds like what you would really like is a IEEE Binary64 encoding, but even that (in theory) could differ among processors so we general avoid taking about encoding at that level."},{"commentid":10002,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"jwalden+beo","name":"Jeff Walden (remove +beo to mail)"},"bug_when":"2014-08-28 16:17:06 -0700","thetext":"I agree with comment 0 that 2**-52 (I assume this is what he meant) would be a much clearer way to write this than base-10.  For comparison, Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER is defined with both a decimal number and (parenthetically) 2**53 - 1.  The latter is definitely the more useful number, and definition, in my estimation.\n\nI'd actually get rid of all the decimal definitions of such IEEE-754 special numbers and have only base-two definitions, if it were me and it were easy to do so.  Unfortunately I'm not sure that\n\n  2**1023 + 2**1022 + ... + 2**972 + 2**971\n\nis a more elegant definition for Number.MAX_VALUE than a decimal expansion, so I don't know that there's an equally readable way to define that one in binary terms."},{"commentid":10167,"comment_count":3,"who":{"uid":"jwalden+beo","name":"Jeff Walden (remove +beo to mail)"},"bug_when":"2014-09-08 20:56:18 -0700","thetext":"Actually, 2**1024 - 2**971 would be a perfectly elegant way to define Number.MAX_VALUE, on second thought.  This would rely on the spec language that math is on actual mathematical values, not IEEE-754 numbers (as 2**1024 becomes Infinity in that system), but otherwise it's much nicer than a decimal definition."},{"commentid":12928,"comment_count":4,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-02-18 14:12:14 -0800","thetext":"deferring for ES7"}]}}

Those that contradict ES5 yet are de-facto web standards\n\nArguably the first category could be split in two as well."},{"commentid":107,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"dfugate","name":"Dave Fugate"},"bug_when":"2011-03-04 14:00:56 -0800","thetext":"My two cents on this is it'd be extremely useful for TC-39 to know about the second category of tests so the de-facto functionality could be incorporated into ECMAScript v.Next.  That said, I do not think such a category should ever be exposed to the public on http://test262.ecmascript.org.  The test suite needs to remain true to the spec.  That said, I think it would be absolutely fine to be able to run this from the command-line version of Test262 (to be created) if one passes the appropriate flags to the harness.  Also, it's fine to keep such tests in the Test262 Mercurial repository provided they're separated from the category one tests  (e.g., test\\suite\\nonstandard\\).\n\nA related opinion on this is that test cases covering ES5 errata should exist in the first category of tests.\n\n\nBased on a command-line extension only, I'm guessing this could be done in well under a day.  Populating test\\suite\\nonstandard\\ is an entirely different story though."},{"commentid":559,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"dfugate","name":"Dave Fugate"},"bug_when":"2012-01-10 12:24:49 -0800","thetext":"We now have a test\\suite\\bestPractices directory.

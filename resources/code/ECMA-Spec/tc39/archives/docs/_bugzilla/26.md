That is, in the converted test the line \"var callee=0, b;\" actually creates a local 'b' object instead of a 'b' attached to the global scope => any conformant ES5 implementation will now fail this.\n\nDisabling the test until we get the converter refactored to account for test cases like this."},{"commentid":47,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"dfugate","name":"Dave Fugate"},"bug_when":"2011-02-21 10:42:44 -0800","thetext":"Same scoping issue for S15.2.2.1_A2_T4.js which I've disabled as well."},{"commentid":129,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"dfugate","name":"Dave Fugate"},"bug_when":"2011-03-07 14:23:55 -0800","thetext":"Fix for this one might be keeping the semantics of the original test with the Sputnik Test Conversion tool.

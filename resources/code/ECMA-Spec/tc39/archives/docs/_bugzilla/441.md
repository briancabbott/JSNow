It's called 'delay'.\n\nWhat does the delay keyword ?\n\nThe delay keyword does nothing more than stop the execution of the current stack and immediately continues to the next task in the queue. But that's not all! Instead of discarding the stack, it adds it to the end of the queue. After all tasks before it are done, the stack continues to execute.\n\nWhat is it good for?\n\ndelay could help make blocking code non-blocking while it still looks like synchronous code. A short example:\n\nsetTimeout(function(){\n\n    console.log(\"two\");\n\n},0);\n\nconsole.log(\"one\");\n\ndelay; //since there is currently another task in the queue, do this task first before continuing\n\nconsole.log(\"three\");\n\n\n//Outputs: one, two, three\n\nThis simple keyword would allow us to create a synchronous-looking code wich is asynchronous behind the scenes. Using node.js modules, for example, would no longer be impossible to use in the browser without trickery.\n\nThere would be so many possibilites with such a keyword!\n\nWhat do YOU JAVASCRIPT DEVELOPERS think about it? What do you think can I do to bring this into the new ECMAscript Specification?\n\nPlease disuss as much as you want! :)"},{"commentid":1096,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2012-07-04 09:44:19 -0700","thetext":"If you want to trigger discussion of this idea you should make a post. to es-discuss@mozilla.org\n\nIf you aren't already a member of that discussion list you can enroll at https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/es-discuss/"},{"commentid":1097,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"patrik.stutz","name":"Patrik Stutz"},"bug_when":"2012-07-04 09:56:17 -0700","thetext":"I've already done that, thanks.

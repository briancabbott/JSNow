Normally, when the spec introduces a parse tree node X and then refers to \"its <nonterminal>\", it's talking about a *child* of X (i.e., the child that is an instance of <nonterminal>). But here it means (pretty much) the *parent* of X. You could maybe replace \"its\" with \"the immediately containing\".\n\n{2}\nbullet 5 continues:\n    ... or if it is within a FunctionBody that begins with a Directive\n    Prologue that contains a Use Strict Directive.\n\nI gather than (roughly speaking), the function code for the parameters of a strict function is also strict function code, but the above condition leaves it out.\n\n{3}\nbullet 6 says:\n    Function code that is supplied as the last argument to the built-in\n    Function constructor is strict mode code if the last argument is a\n    String that when processed as a FunctionBody begins with a Directive\n    Prologue that contains a Use Strict Directive.\n\nAgain, this leaves out the function code for parameters. Change the first occurrence of \"the last argument\" to just \"arguments\".\n\n{4}\nIt seems to me that bullet 6 is just a special case of (the second half of) bullet 5. But I guess it doesn't hurt to call it out on its own.\n\n{5}\nShouldn't there be a GeneratorFunction analogue to bullet 6?

E.g.:\n-- change the Note's typeface, text color (gray level), background color,\n   and/or indentation,\n-- put a box around it,\n-- put it in brackets, or\n-- end it with something like \"End Note\".\n\n(I looked at a couple other Ecma specs, and there doesn't appear to be a \"house style\" for Notes.)"},{"commentid":4365,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-07-11 16:29:44 -0700","thetext":"actually the ECMA  house style for TC39 is basically the ISO/IEC style http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&objId=4230456&objAction=browse&sort=subtypeâˆš \n\nbecause TC39 standards are usually fast-tracked as ISO standards."},{"commentid":4384,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"jmdyck","name":"Michael Dyck"},"bug_when":"2013-07-12 01:04:24 -0700","thetext":"In that document (\"Rules for the structure and drafting of International Standards\"), the relevant section appears to be 6.5.1 \"Notes and examples integrated in the text\".

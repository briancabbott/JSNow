The old-style RegExp system knows nothing about code points, it doesn't support them in a meaningful way, but it also doesn't limit them to the BMP. It simply operates on 16-bit units. A number of people have used it to successfully support full Unicode, but by mapping regular expressions based on Unicode code points to regular expressions based on UTF-16 code units. You can't talk about \"a sequence of 16-bit values that are Unicode code points in the range of the Basic Multilingual Plane\" because neither the Unicode Standard nor ECMAScript define a mapping from sequences of 16-bit values to Unicode code points whose range is limited to the BMP.\n\nWhen describing the old-style RegExp system, we should not use the term \"code point\" at all. If you don't like \"UTF-16 code unit\", then \"16-bit code unit\" or such is fine."},{"commentid":9718,"comment_count":7,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-08-07 14:30:22 -0700","thetext":"I'm sure I see your problem with 21.2.2.  the official Unicode glossary defines the term \"BMP code point\" http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#BMP_code_point \n\nTo me, the language in that paragraph seems consistent with that definition.\n\nIt also doesn't seem relevant that the old ES5 RegExp could be made to do some useful work with UTF-16 encoded strings.

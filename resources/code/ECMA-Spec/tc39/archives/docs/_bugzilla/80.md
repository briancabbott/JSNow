E.g., \"\\1\".  ES5.1 actually allows this type of scenario via the JavaScript syntax extension clause found in Chapter 16:\n    An implementation may extend program syntax and regular expression pattern\nor flag syntax. To permit this, all operations (such as calling eval, using a\nregular expression literal, or using the Function or RegExp constructor) that\nare allowed to throw SyntaxError are permitted to exhibit\nimplementation-defined behaviour instead of throwing SyntaxError when they\nencounter an implementation-defined extension to the program syntax or regular\nexpression pattern or flag syntax.\n\nAfter consulting with the TC-39 committee, we've decided 'negative parser\ntests' should be disabled unless ES5.1 explicitly calls out that\nthey should throw.  E.g., literal octals in strings under Strict Mode would be\na valid negative test case we would not disable.  Literal octals in strings outside of Strict Mode would *not* be a valid negative test case.\n\nIn the long term, the test harness and website will be adapted to allow opting-in WRT running these invalid albeit useful tests."},{"commentid":206,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"dfugate","name":"Dave Fugate"},"bug_when":"2011-05-10 13:46:35 -0700","thetext":"Disabling these is trivial; identifying them...not-so-much.

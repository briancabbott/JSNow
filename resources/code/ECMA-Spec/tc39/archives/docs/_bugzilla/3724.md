In particular, if code is given a proxy with an \"enumerate\" trap, it can merely enclose the proxy in an Object.create() call to bypass the trap outright.\n\nSee: https://esdiscuss.org/topic/the-enumerate-trap-and-object-create"},{"commentid":12609,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-02-13 16:11:21 -0800","thetext":"fixed in rev34 editor's draft"},{"commentid":13089,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-02-19 19:11:01 -0800","thetext":"fixed in rev34"}]}}

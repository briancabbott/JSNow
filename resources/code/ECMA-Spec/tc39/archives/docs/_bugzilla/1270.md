However, simply because the internal method is named [[GetProto]] doesn't mean that it must be a simple getter for [[Prototype]]. It could be arbitrarily complex, as you note, but that's why we introduce an internal method rather than internal attribute. The name [[GetProto]] would hint better at what the \"default implementation\" does, IMHO.\n\nIn any case, feel free to use your judgment as the spec editor on what terminology fits best. I'm fine either way."},{"commentid":5792,"comment_count":3,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-10-01 17:33:03 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev19"}]}}

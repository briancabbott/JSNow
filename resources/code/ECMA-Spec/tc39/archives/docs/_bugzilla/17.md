Actually, may/could/should this be considered as some guideline for writing tests?

If you have any suggestions on automatically detecting these so they can be fixed, I'm all ears. Otherwise it's going to take a bit of time to go through all the test cases by hand.  Thanks again for the great suggestions!"}]}}

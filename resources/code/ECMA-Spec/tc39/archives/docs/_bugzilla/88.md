It contains paths to all tests. All of these could be downloaded right away. Even if they are not use right away. If downloaded (with XMLHttpRequest) and cached by the browser, later attempts to retrieve the tests will be a fetch from cache which is usually far more efficient that a network request.\nHaving the right HTTP headers and changing the behavior when recieving testcaseslist.json sounds like easy changes to make and the benefits may be important."},{"commentid":203,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"dfugate","name":"Dave Fugate"},"bug_when":"2011-05-10 11:39:31 -0700","thetext":"Conservatively estimating four hours on this mainly due to the testing against all platforms that will be needed afterwards.\n\nBeefing up the Importance to 'High' - this has been suggested multiple times."}]}}

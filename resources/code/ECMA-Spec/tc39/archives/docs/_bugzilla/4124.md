The same could be said of many of the bugs I submit.\n\n> How about \"matches\" or \"matched\"?\n\nCurrently, when the spec says \"X matches production P\", X is source text. (E.g. \"Always throw a Syntax Error if code matches this production.\") So a usage in which X is a node in the parse tree seems like a category error too. However, it's better than \"is\", so I'd live with it."},{"commentid":13746,"comment_count":3,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-03-16 11:29:21 -0700","thetext":"deferring to ES7 along with Bug 2985"}]}}

The typed array conformance tests at https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/sdk/tests/conformance/typedarrays/array-unit-tests.html were modified, and bugs filed against multiple browsers to expose it:\n\nhttp://crbug.com/60449\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=796327\nhttps://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=105605\n\nPlease update the typed array section in the ES 6 draft specification to reflect this change, so that code written against the current typed array draft will work when these types are incorporated into ES 6."},{"commentid":4329,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"kbr","name":"Kenneth Russell"},"bug_when":"2013-06-26 11:34:36 -0700","thetext":"After additional discussion, it was decided not to pursue this direction. Instead, a new static function ArrayBuffer.isView(value) was added. The [NoInterfaceObject] extended attribute was once again added to the ArrayBufferView interface in the typed array spec, and the typed array conformance tests (part of the WebGL conformance suite) have been updated to test ArrayBuffer.isView (not yet implemented by any UA)."}]}}

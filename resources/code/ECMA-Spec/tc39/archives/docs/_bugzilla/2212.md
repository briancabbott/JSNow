I am hoping that this decision will be reversed OR an alternate method can be devised.\n\nFunctions in JavaScript are exceedingly powerful.  Their first-class nature is of paramount importance to the language.  Functions can be passed around with impunity and attributes can be defined upon them as appropriate.  I believe the deprecation of arguments.callee without something to replace it will harm the expressivity and usefulness of the language.\n\nThe issue is that in removing arguments.callee, we lose the only method through which we can access a function’s attributes within the scope of that function.  \n\nThis means that without arguments.callee ( or something that replaces it), functions will become ‘special cases’ as the only objects in JavaScript which have no way to access their own properties."},{"commentid":6834,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"claude.pache","name":"Claude Pache"},"bug_when":"2013-11-17 13:31:24 -0800","thetext":"Simply give a name to your function.

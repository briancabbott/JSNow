If form is not provided or undefined.\n\nThe strawman had \"If form is undefined or not provided, let form be 'NFC'.\" It seems the entire step has become unnecessary because the function parameter list now provides a default value for form.\n\nThe function also has a step that lists \"NFC\" twice and omits \"NFKD\" from its condition, and then has two \"then\" parts for one \"if\":\n\n7. If f is not one of \"NFC\", \"NFD\", \"NFKC\", or \"NFC\", then let form be \"NFKD\", then throw a RangeError Exception.\n\nThe statement should be\n\n7. If f is not one of \"NFC\", \"NFD\", \"NFKC\", or \"NFKD\", then throw a RangeError Exception.\n\nFinally, step 8 contains \"by in\".

It's harder to test, and I can't think of a good reason why implementations could want to make different choices here.\n\nEvery browser I can test escapes to lowercase hex, so it seems best to require the produced hexadecimal digits to be lowercase.\n\nI originally raised this on the es5-discuss list:\n\nhttps://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es5-discuss/2011-March/003963.html\n\n...receiving the response, \"Unintentional under specification.

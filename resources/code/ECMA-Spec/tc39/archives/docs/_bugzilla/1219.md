That would be awesome."},{"commentid":3283,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-03-05 17:56:23 -0800","thetext":"The quote line is in the context discussing the signature specification used for internal methods and is really just saying that the self value of an internal method invocation is always an implicit parameter.\n\nI'm not sure what you have in mind saying about things that are not accessible. All specified internal method implementation are in the spec. so they can be examined to see what they do or don't access. \n\nAre there some restrictions you want to place upon implementation specific internal methods?"}]}}

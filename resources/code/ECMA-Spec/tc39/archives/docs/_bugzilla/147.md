Let /member/ be the concatenation of /member/ and the colon character.\n iii. If /gap/ is not the empty String\n     1. Let /member/ be the concatenation of /member/ and the /space/ character.\n\nThe text \"the /space/ character\", interpreted literally, does not make sense; the use of italicized /space/ would be interpreted as a reference to the Number or String value, which do not generally serve as names for characters.\n\nLars Hansen pointed out this problem in a comment while making an Actionscript implementation of the JSON class [3].  \n\nA reasonable hypothesis is that this is a formatting typo, and that the occurrence of the word \"space\" should not have been italicized.  However, the text introducing the \"JO(value)\" abstract operation explicitly states that the operation has access to /space/ of the invocation of the stringify method, while there are no other references to /space/ that I can see in the text defining the \"JO(value)\" abstract operation.  So that would also need to be corrected if this is just a formatting typo.\n\nCheers,\n-Felix Klock"},{"commentid":340,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2011-07-20 16:07:05 -0700","thetext":"see comment in original bug.

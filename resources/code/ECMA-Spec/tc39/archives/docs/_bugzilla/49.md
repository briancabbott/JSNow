I've already moved IE Test Center's test helper objects/functions into test\\harness\\sta.js.  What's still remaining is:\n1.  Moving sputnikLib.js into sta.js\n2.  Eliminating duplicated functionality in sta.js\n3.  Cleaning up sta.js by throwing all the helper functions and objects into a wrapper object (e.g., 'sta')\n4.  Adjusting Sputnik's test converter to utilize the renamed test library functions *and* writing a converter for IE Test Center tests as well\n\nThis should arguably be done *after* Sputnik's conformance tests are ported over to Test262 for the last time (would make step 4 quite a bit easier)."},{"commentid":109,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"dfugate","name":"Dave Fugate"},"bug_when":"2011-03-04 15:20:36 -0800","thetext":"Guesstimating this will take a full week to do correctly."},{"commentid":461,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"dfugate","name":"Dave Fugate"},"bug_when":"2011-09-23 16:30:08 -0700"},{"commentid":557,"comment_count":3,"who":{"uid":"dfugate","name":"Dave Fugate"},"bug_when":"2012-01-10 12:22:56 -0800","thetext":"Some work on this has been done already."},{"commentid":843,"comment_count":4,"who":{"uid":"dfugate","name":"Dave Fugate"},"bug_when":"2012-03-28 16:21:20 -0700","thetext":"sta.js has been created and all Sputnik helpers have been moved there.

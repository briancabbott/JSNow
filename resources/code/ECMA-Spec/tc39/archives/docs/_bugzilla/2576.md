If length is undefined, then throw a TypeError exception.\n\nTyped arrays are the only integer indexed exotic objects and their [[ArrayLength]] data slot is always initialised with 0, see 22.2.2.4 %TypedArray%[ @@create ], step 10. That means the if-condition will always evaluate to false. If step 3.c.iii is supposed to test the initialisation state of an integer indexed exotic object, a different internal data slot needs to be used. Otherwise the if-condition should be removed or changed to an assertion."},{"commentid":7438,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-03-18 10:40:04 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev23 editor's draft\n\ndeleted the check for undefined"},{"commentid":7550,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-04-06 11:30:15 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev23 draft"}]}}

Maybe it should just return \"bound f\" instead? From a usability point of view, repeating \"bound\" for every bound function level seems rather distracting.\n\nThere are some open issues here, like should \"bound\" only be dropped if the target name already starts with \"bound\" or should it be dropped for all bound functions, etc. ?"},{"commentid":10306,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-10-09 12:13:24 -0700","thetext":"I don't see why the extra \"bound\"s are an issue.  This is primarily used for debugging and the fact that a function has been bound multiple times may be useful debugging information.\n\nMay be you should bring this up on es-discuss and see if anybody else has strong opinions of this."}]}}

If it is not provided, undefined is used instead.\n\ncallbackfn is called with three arguments: the current value, the current value again for API consistency and the set instance object itself.\n\n\n**NOTE** This was a basic attempt to match the sematics of Array.prototype.forEach for API consistency.

When ToUint32() is called in step 5, user defined code can be executed (e.g. a custom 'valueOf' function, see above). This user code may change the array's length again and thereby invalidate the previously stored `oldLen` value. And as a result, both ArraySetLength invocations assume `newLen >= oldLen` (step 8) and no array trimming will be applied. \n\na = [];\na.[[DefineOwnProperty]](\"length\", {[[Value: 1 (user code)]]})\n -> ArraySetLength(A = a, Desc = {[[Value: 1 (user code)]]})\n   -> oldLen = 0\n   -> newLen = ToUint32(Desc.[[Value]]) = 1\n     /* start user code as a side-effect of ToUint32() */\n     -> a.[[DefineOwnProperty]](\"length\", {[[Value: 10]]})\n       -> ArraySetLength(A = a, Desc = {[[Value: 10]]})\n         -> oldLen = 0\n         -> newLen = ToUint32(Desc.[[Value]]) = 10\n         -> newLen(10) >= oldLen(0) => OrdinaryDefineOwnProperty(A, \"length\", newLenDesc = {[[Value: 10]]})\n         -> return\n     -> a.[[SetP]](\"5\", 'test', a)\n     /* end user code as a side-effect of ToUint32() */\n   -> newLen(1) >= oldLen(0) => OrdinaryDefineOwnProperty(A, \"length\", newLenDesc = {[[Value: 1]]})\n\nNow `a`'s \"length\" property will be `1`, but the property at index 5 wasn't removed. \n\n\nThis bug is also present in the ES5.1 specification."},{"commentid":11753,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"jorendorff","name":"Jason Orendorff"},"bug_when":"2015-01-29 16:42:33 -0800","thetext":"I think this has been fixed.\n\nIn the current draft (rev 31) the coercion happens in step 4, and doesn't get the array's oldLen until steps 6-9."},{"commentid":11757,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"andrebargull","name":"AndrÃ© Bargull"},"bug_when":"2015-01-30 04:11:17 -0800","thetext":"(In reply to Jason Orendorff from comment #1)\n> I think this has been fixed.\n\nThis issue report is for a possible 5.1 errata, ES6 was covered in bug 1200."}]}}

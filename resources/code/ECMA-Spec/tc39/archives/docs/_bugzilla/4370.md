In determining the sequence any\n    occurrences of \\ UnicodeEscapeSequence are first replaced with the code\n    point represented by the UnicodeEscapeSequence and then the code points\n    of the entire IdentifierName are converted to code units by UTF16Encoding\n    (10.1.1) each code point.\n\nThis step is fairly informal. For consistency, you could change the section body to something like:\n\n    IdentifierName :: IdentifierStart\n        1. Return the StringValue of IdentifierStart.\n\n    IdentifierName :: IdentifierName IdentifierPart\n        1.

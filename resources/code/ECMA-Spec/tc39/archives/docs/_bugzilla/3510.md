It says:\n\nIt is a Syntax Error if PropertyNameList of PropertyDefinitionList contains any duplicate entries for \"__proto__\" and at least two of those entries were obtained from productions of the form PropertyDefinition : PropertyName : AssignmentExpression .\n\nWhere PropertyName is defined as:\n\nPropertyName[Yield,GeneratorParameter] :\n  LiteralPropertyName\n  [+GeneratorParameter] ComputedPropertyName\n  [~GeneratorParameter] ComputedPropertyName[?Yield]\n\nLiteralPropertyName :\n  IdentifierName\n  StringLiteral\n  NumericLiteral\n\nThat paragraph (using the definitions provided) asserts that it is a syntax error if there are any duplicate uses of __proto__ with an IdentifierName, StringLiteral, or ComputedPropertyName. To translate this into an example, it seems to assert that in ES6 this is not valid:\n\n// Error: SyntaxError\nvar obj = {\n  __proto__: somePrototype,\n  [\"__proto__\"]: somePrototype\n}"},{"commentid":11308,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"Fkschott","name":"Fred K.

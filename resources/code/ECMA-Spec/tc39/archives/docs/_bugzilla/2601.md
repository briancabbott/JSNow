Loader.prototype.import launches AsyncStartLoadPartwayThrough. But no load should be started if the requested module is already loaded or loading. Loader.prototype.import needs to check first, to see if the module is already loaded or loading.\n\nThe loading case is slightly tricky. The easiest fix is to add a Promise to each Load Record that resolves when the module is removed from loader.[[Loads]]."},{"commentid":9066,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"guybedford","name":"Guy Bedford"},"bug_when":"2014-06-22 19:12:20 -0700","thetext":"Moving this to modules."},{"commentid":13772,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-03-16 14:41:30 -0700","thetext":"concerns old module spec."}]}}

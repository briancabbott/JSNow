In particular, the code point sequence <0022,\nDEAD, 0022> is a valid JSON text. \n\nHowever, this code point sequence cannot be represented in UTF-8, UTF-16, or\nUTF-32, as it is not a sequence of Unicode scalar values, and Unicode\nencoding forms are only defined on Unicode scalar values.\n\nAs JSON is a text format designed to facilitate data interchange, this is a\nbug that should be fixed."},{"commentid":6926,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"james.h.manger","name":"James Manger"},"bug_when":"2013-12-11 05:44:44 -0800","thetext":"If ECMA-404 defined JSON text (and JSON strings) as a sequence of Unicode scalar values it would work well.\n\nAdditional rules mandating specific support for unpaired surrogates (as 16-bit code units and as \\uDxxx escapes) could be put in ECMAScript."},{"commentid":6927,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-12-11 09:21:26 -0800","thetext":"(In reply to comment #1)\n> If ECMA-404 defined JSON text (and JSON strings) as a sequence of Unicode\n> scalar values it would work well.\n> \n> Additional rules mandating specific support for unpaired surrogates (as 16-bit\n> code units and as \\uDxxx escapes) could be put in ECMAScript.\n\nThat would force ECMA=262 to define an extended JSON grammar and that is something we are trying to avoid. We want to be able to just reference the normative grammar in ECMA-404.\n\nECMAScript/JavaScript is far from being the only language that has a string data type that allows the encoding of unpaired surrogates.  Embedded JSON parsers for those languages all have to deal with them, one way or another.  \n\nIt's better for ECMA-404 to define this rather than each language doing its own thing.\n\nSpecifications such as 4627bis that define encodings used to transmit/interchange JSON texts are free to requiring the use of a subset of Unicode code points. For example only scalar values or at an extreme only ASCII values.\n\nBasically, the ECMA=404 approach is to start with a more general specification of the JSON format with the expectation that other specification will specialize it with restrictions."},{"commentid":6928,"comment_count":3,"who":{"uid":"pfpschneider","name":"Peter F.

I thus expected that ECMA-404 would permit natural transmittal between senders and receivers that use different languages or toolsets.\n\nIf ECMA-404 has to be subsetted so that it can be reliably used for data exchange then why would it get any use outside of the ECMAScript community?"}]}}

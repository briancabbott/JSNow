But the specification is not entirely precise when to raise the TypeError: Does it happen on function entry or when actually trying to access the value?\n\nFor Example Number.prototype.toFixed [15.7.4.5]:\n---\n1.  Let f be ToInteger(fractionDigits). (If fractionDigits is undefined, this step produces the value 0).\n2.  ReturnIfAbrupt(f).\n3.  If f < 0 or f > 20, throw a RangeError exception.\n4.  Let x be this Number value.\n5.  ReturnIfAbrupt(x).\n---\n\n\nLet's recall [15.7.4] to get the explanation for the phrase “this Number value”:\n---\n[...]\nAlso, the phrase “this Number value” refers to either the Number value represented by this Number object, that is, the value of the [[NumberData]] internal data property of this Number object or the `this` value if its type is Number. A TypeError exception is thrown if the `this` value is neither an object that has a [[NumberData]] internal data property or a value whose type is Number.\n---\n\n\nI'd say calling toFixed with an incompatible object should nevertheless execute the steps 1-3, and then finally in step 4 raise a TypeError, because at that point “this Number value” is retrieved. All engines tested (IE10, Opera, JSC, Spidermonkey [1]) raise the TypeError on function entry, that means steps 1-3 are _not_ executed. I've used the following test case:\n---\nNumber.prototype.toFixed.call({}, {valueOf: function(){throw \"value-of\"}})\n---\n\n\n\n[1] V8 is not included in this list because of http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=2449"},{"commentid":3299,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2013-03-07 10:54:47 -0800","thetext":"fixed in rev 14 editor's draft\n\nas far as I can tell, toFixed was the only method with this issue.

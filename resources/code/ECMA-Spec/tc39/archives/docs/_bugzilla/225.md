A possible solution is to not have a namespace, but instead provide a module loader similar to what's planned for ES6.\n\nDiscussion threads start at:\nhttps://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/2011-November/018560.html\nhttps://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/2011-November/018600.html"},{"commentid":697,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"ecmascriptbugs","name":"Norbert"},"bug_when":"2012-02-27 20:57:45 -0800","thetext":"This issue was discussed again in the TC39 meeting January 2012, and the consensus was that the Internationalization API shouldn't become dependent on a module system that's not fully defined yet. We'll therefore stick with a namespace object.\n\nGlobalization seems too long to many, and it appears the name was also used in the global namespace by an early version of the library now called Globalize, so we switched to Intl.\n\nThe change from Globalization to Intl is included in the spec draft of 2012-02-23."}]}}

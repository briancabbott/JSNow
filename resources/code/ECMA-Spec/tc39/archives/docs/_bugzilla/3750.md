But since TopLevelModuleEvaluationJob (see bug 3749) only has to link a single module and assumes all its dependencies are already linked, it can just directly call Instantiate on that module. LinkModules itself is unused and goes away.\n\nDave"},{"commentid":12110,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"dherman","name":"Dave Herman"},"bug_when":"2015-02-04 13:44:21 -0800","thetext":"See https://gist.github.com/dherman/cad85565e0eb16d0a22d for details.\n\nDave"},{"commentid":12857,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-02-17 17:30:51 -0800","thetext":"fixed in rev34 editor's draft"},{"commentid":13052,"comment_count":3,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-02-19 19:10:56 -0800","thetext":"fixed in rev34"}]}}

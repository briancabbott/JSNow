Since \"holes are evil\", the array-like case should lose the kPresent test in step 17b etc."},{"commentid":7446,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-03-18 15:20:12 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev23 editor's draft"},{"commentid":7588,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2014-04-06 11:31:06 -0700","thetext":"fixed in rev23 draft"}]}}

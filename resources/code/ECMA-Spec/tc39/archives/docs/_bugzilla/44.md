It's just a bit non-trivial to implement until we get tests from all external contributions living happily in the same predictable directory.  For example, instead of having \"test/suite/ietestcenter/chapter07/*\" and \"test/suite/sputnik_converted/07_Lexical_Conventions/7.6_Identifiers/*\", we'd simply have \"test/suite/ch07/*\".  Any ways, once this directory cleanup occurs I think we should go ahead and do this."},{"commentid":124,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"dfugate","name":"Dave Fugate"},"bug_when":"2011-03-07 13:45:24 -0800","thetext":"Test estimate seems a bit too high.

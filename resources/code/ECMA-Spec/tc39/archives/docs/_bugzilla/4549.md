I could not find any [[GetOwnProperty]] method for functions in the spec, so at least the \"defined here part\" is wrong :-) I see that we have customisations of the ordinary object one for proxies, arguments objects, namespaces, integer-indexed objects and strings, but I can't even imagine why we would have a custom one for functions.\n\n(not sure whether this is an editorial or technical issue)"},{"commentid":14905,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"andrebargull","name":"André Bargull"},"bug_when":"2015-12-09 10:18:57 -0800","thetext":"This is a leftover from ES5. 9.2 is already updated (bug 4458, https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/commit/f469b0cb6162cf06524a09ef7e768a5ecd2e5db4), but apparently I've missed the note in 9.4.1."},{"commentid":14907,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"brterlso","name":"Brian Terlson"},"bug_when":"2015-12-15 12:13:26 -0800","thetext":"Fixed in ES2016 Draft (5fd2e72)."}]}}

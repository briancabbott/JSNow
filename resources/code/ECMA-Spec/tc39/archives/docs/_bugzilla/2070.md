For Unicode strings, \\w matches all Unicode alphanumeric characters, whereas \\b only matches ASCII characters.  I am using the workaround of changing \\b into (?!\\w), and it works, but it's very confusing to have \\w to match one set of characters and \\b work with a different set."},{"commentid":14777,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"brterlso","name":"Brian Terlson"},"bug_when":"2015-10-04 09:08:02 -0700","thetext":"Substantive changes should go through the proposal process defined here: https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md."}]}}

The PDF table of contents can be shown, for example, in the side bar of the Preview application on Mac. Clickable cross-references let you jump, e.g., from section 10.2.3 to 9.1 by clicking the cross-reference \"9.1\". Both features are present in the PDF version of the first edition.\n\nI suspect both features are missing because the Mac version of Word is crippled and doesn't support them. PDF versions of ECMAScript standards should therefore be generated on Windows."},{"commentid":12896,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"waldron.rick","name":"Rick Waldron"},"bug_when":"2015-02-18 06:54:13 -0800","thetext":"I have no idea why that's not present, I saved the document the same as usual.

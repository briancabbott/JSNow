Correct uses of Expire and ETag headers should avoid this issue.\nFor this particular file, cache may not be necessary. It's very small (~3k to date) and will change at each version. The bottleneck isn't really here."},{"commentid":202,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"dfugate","name":"Dave Fugate"},"bug_when":"2011-05-03 10:38:22 -0700","thetext":"Looks like this involves Apache configuration and will need to be handled by Mozilla."},{"commentid":250,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"dfugate","name":"Dave Fugate"},"bug_when":"2011-07-01 11:04:47 -0700","thetext":"Think I've figured out a way to fix this without touching Apache's configuration:\n$.ajaxSetup({cache:false});\n\nTested on a locally-hosted version of test262 which seems to work.

ES5.1 doesn't define a global 'toString' function =>\n2.  'toString' must be coming in as an unspec'ed browser extension *or* from Object.prototype.toString.  The former would make this obviously invalid, and the latter means the global object's prototype is in fact Object.prototype =>\n3. Section 15.1 of ES5.1 states:\n   The values of the [[Prototype]] and [[Class]] internal properties of the global object are implementation-dependent.\n\n=> the test is indeed invalid.  I'll disable it shortly, and thanks for reporting this."},{"commentid":452,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"gsneddon","name":"Geoffrey Sneddon"},"bug_when":"2011-09-15 13:57:16 -0700","thetext":"Ah, I didn't bother actually checking the spec, and just assumed the global object's prototype chain contained Object.prototype. :)\n\nAll implementations except Opera have Window.prototype as the prototype of the global object (and the prototype of that is Object.prototype); Opera has Object.prototype as the prototype of the global object (there is no Window object)."},{"commentid":562,"comment_count":3,"who":{"uid":"dfugate","name":"Dave Fugate"},"bug_when":"2012-01-12 09:50:21 -0800","thetext":"Removed the test case from source control."}]}}

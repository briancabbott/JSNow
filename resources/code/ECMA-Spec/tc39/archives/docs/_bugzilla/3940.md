Otherwise,\n    StatementList is evaluated in the following steps as non-strict mode code.\n\nThe first sentence is just a restatement of some of the rules in 10.2.1, but it's phrased as if it augments 10.2.1, which is puzzling.\n\nWith the second and third sentences, it's unclear what normative impact they have. Is the implementation supposed to *do* something based on the presence of those sentences? My guess is, they're more like a Note, just informing the implementer of something that other points in the spec will specify in detail.\n\nOverall, I'd say delete the whole step, it's just a distraction.\n\nSimilarly for:\n    14.2.16 \"Runtime Semantics: EvaluateBody\"\nand\n    15.1.7  \"Runtime Semantics: ScriptEvaluation\""},{"commentid":12691,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-02-14 15:42:20 -0800","thetext":"fixed in rev34 editor's draft\n\nI( agree, it's just left over text from ES5."},{"commentid":13057,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-02-19 19:10:56 -0800","thetext":"fixed in rev34"}]}}

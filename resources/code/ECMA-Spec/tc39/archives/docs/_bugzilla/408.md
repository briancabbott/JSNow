For validation and localized UI elements, it is required to know the format and elements of the date/time format patterns.\n\nFor example, HTML forms for date/time input often use separate fields for the year, month, day, etc. It is necessary to determine the order of those fields programmatically in order to generate such a form appropriately for the browser's locale. For selection UI elements (dropdown controls), the names of the fields are required as well to populate the selection choices.\n\nProposal: To add functions to the Date object to get each month and day name (\"März\", \"Dienstag\"), to get localized AM/PM names, and to get date, time, and date+time format patterns as used by the Date object (e.g., an array like [\"Y\", \"M\", \"D\", \"h\", \"m\"]).\n\nThere are various ways to do this. For example: getDayName(index), getMonthName(index), getAMName(), getPMName(), getDatePattern(), getTimePattern(), getDateTimePattern().\n\nThe getXYZPattern() functions could return array objects corresponding to the order and types of fields used for formatting and parsing date/time strings. Each array element could be\n\n• A single-letter string like \"Y\" for the year field (using Java date/time pattern characters).\n• A string like \"year\" for the year field (using Java date/time pattern field names).\n• A number like 1 for the year field (using Java date/time pattern field indexes).\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/markusicu/unicode/es/i18n-2003#DateTime"},{"commentid":14927,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"caridy","name":"Caridy Patiño"},"bug_when":"2016-02-15 16:27:28 -0800","thetext":"The `formatToParts()` proposal for dates can help with this, more details here: https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/30"}]}}

Here are the necessary fixes in the Word document:\n\nAbove table 8, in the text \"Table 8 summarises\", and above table 9, in the text \"Table 9 summarises\", set the cursor at the end of the white space after the table number and delete backwards until the table reference is highlighted. Reinsert one white space. This deletes some empty cross references left over from previous edits.\n\nMake the text reference to table 28 not bold.\n\nMake the caption for table 28 use the paragraph style \"Table title\", but without character styles (it's currently styled bold)."},{"commentid":3067,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2012-12-21 11:53:18 -0800","thetext":"fixed in rev 13 editor's draft"},{"commentid":9635,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"ecmascriptbugs","name":"Norbert"},"bug_when":"2014-07-27 22:20:33 -0700","thetext":"Verified in rev 26 draft.

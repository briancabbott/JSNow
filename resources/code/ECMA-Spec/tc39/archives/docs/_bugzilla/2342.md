The first line implies we are banning future reserved words (and yield,) but the second line uses ReservedWord which would cover a superset of the list given on the first line. It would also be enforced in non-strict mode.\n\nFrom 11.6.2:\nReservedWord ::\nKeyword\nFutureReservedWord\nNullLiteral\nBooleanLiteral\n\nIt seems to me that the intention here was to have the second line read:\n\nIt is a Syntax Error if IdentifierReference is a Keyword other than yield."},{"commentid":6873,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"andrebargull","name":"André Bargull"},"bug_when":"2013-12-03 00:58:50 -0800","thetext":"The set of FutureReservedWord tokens has been reduced to only contain the token 'enum', regardless of strict mode.

That's just minor nit-picking to align the style with ES2015, but it's totally up to you if you want to mimic Allen's style from ES2015. You're the editor of the ECMA-402 spec, so I'm also ok if you prefer a different style or if you say you don't care about these things. (TBH, actually I don't even care about most editorial issues. I do report them, but I think technical issues are by far more interesting.)"},{"commentid":14341,"comment_count":4,"who":{"uid":"waldron.rick","name":"Rick Waldron"},"bug_when":"2015-04-29 09:53:28 -0700","thetext":"(In reply to André Bargull from comment #3)\n> (In reply to Rick Waldron from comment #1)\n> > > Step 2: Remove colon\n> > > Step 2.a.i: Omit \"then\"\n> > \n> > These are remnants of 1st Edition.

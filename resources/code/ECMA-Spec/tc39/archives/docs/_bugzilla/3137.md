Testing current versions of popular web browsers reveals that, in reality, all of them do a `ToNumber()` conversion on the result of `compareFn` (see Comment #1 for the testcase).\n\nTherefore, step 17 of the SortCompare abstract operation (22.1.3.24.1 and 22.2.3.26) should be modified as follows:\n\n17. If the argument comparefn is not undefined, then\n  (steps a, b, c unchanged)\n  d. Let vNum be ToNumber(v).\n  e. ReturnIfAbrupt(vNum).\n  f. If vNum < 0, then return -1.\n  g. If vNum > 0, then return 1.\n  h. Return +0.\n\nSteps f-h are a further refinement (maybe not really needed), ensuring that all results > 0, resp. < 0, are considered equivalent. With the above changes, the SortCompare() operation returns either -1, 1 or +0, or an abrupt completion."},{"commentid":9792,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"claude.pache","name":"Claude Pache"},"bug_when":"2014-08-15 07:41:49 -0700","thetext":"The testcase I used was the following: \n\n    var a = []\n    for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n        a[i] = Math.random()\n    }\n\n    function compareFn(a, b) {\n        console.log(\"compareFn called with arguments \", a, b)\n        var result = a - b\n        return { valueOf: function() { \n            console.log(\"valueOf called!\"); \n            return result  \n        } }\n    }\n\n    a.sort(compareFn)"},{"commentid":9794,"comment_count":2,"who":{"uid":"claude.pache","name":"Claude Pache"},"bug_when":"2014-08-15 08:31:40 -0700","thetext":"(In reply to Claude Pache from comment #1)\nIn order to convince oneself that implementations really do a ToNumber() and not just a ToPrimitive(), further test is needed.

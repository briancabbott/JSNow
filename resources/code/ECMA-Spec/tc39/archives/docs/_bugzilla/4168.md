In particular, we generally set the length for methods newly defined in ES6 to be the length that would be generated by a corresponding ES function declaration with that signature.\n\nIn this case, I don't think we want the length of 'next' and 'return' to not change from 1 to 0. \n\nChanging the spec. signature really has no other implications other than suggesting what is \"normal\" and in this case I think that all depends upon  specific use cases."}]}}

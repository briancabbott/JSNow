Some of them haven't been removed from CreateRealm, however: steps 5-9.\n\nGiven that CreateRealm now basically just creates realmRec and its member record `intrinsics`, (as step 10 is made redundant by steps 20-22 of 26.2.1.1) maybe those two steps should be inlined into the Reflect.Realm constructor.\n\nThus, steps 5-7 of 26.2.1.1 could be the current steps 1-3 of 8.2.1.

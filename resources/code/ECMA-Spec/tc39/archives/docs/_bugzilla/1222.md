Note that \"defensive\" is also wrong, as this enables an object to defend itself but does not ensure that it does.\n\nI know Tom suggested \"tamper proof\", but we're already using that for something more specific -- where configurable data properties on prototypal objects are locked down by turning them into accessor properties that allow override by assignment.

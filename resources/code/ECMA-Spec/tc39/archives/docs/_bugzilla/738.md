If iterable is undefined, then\n        a. [current step 5]\n        b. [current step 6]\n        c. return obj\n    [current steps 4.a - 4.h]\n    [current step 5]\n    [current step 6]\n    [current step 8]\n\nThis has the downside of repeating the current steps 5 and 6:\n    5. Add a [[MapData]] internal property to obj.\n    6. Set obj's [[MapData]] internal property to a new empty List.\n\nHowever, it occurs to me that step 5 is odd: it adds an internal property without setting it. That is, the spec would normally combine those two steps into one:\n\n    Add a [[MapData]] internal property to obj with value an empty List.\n\n(or, if that sounds a bit clunky, \"... with an empty List as its value\".)\n\nSo assuming that change, then my suggested refactoring would only repeat a single step, which doesn't seem like much of a drawback.\n\nDitto all that to the corresponding algorithms in 15.15.1.1 and 15.16.1.1."},{"commentid":3046,"comment_count":4,"who":{"uid":"andrebargull","name":"André Bargull"},"bug_when":"2012-12-19 09:40:14 -0800","thetext":"Steps 2-3 also need to be moved, since 4a-h are not side effect free, which means it's technically possible to execute steps 5-6 multiple times.

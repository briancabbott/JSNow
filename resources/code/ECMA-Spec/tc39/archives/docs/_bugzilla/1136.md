We only had want was proposed as necessary for a few specific integrity motivated use cases.\n\nFor ES6, it isn't clear to me that we can get agreement on a complete set but we can try.\n\nHowever, instead of adding in new isolated invariants we need a full invariant set to evaluate\n\nSomebody should put together a proposal for the complete invariant set for the MOP (internal methods)."}]}}

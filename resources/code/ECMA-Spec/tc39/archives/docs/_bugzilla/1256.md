Step 18 uses the condition \"if c is not undefined and the result of calling the IsWellFormedCurrencyCode abstract operation ... with argument c is false\". It's not clear whether the \"and\" should be read Pascal-style or C-style. If it's read Pascal-style, then IsWellFormedCurrencyCode can be called with undefined; if it's read C-style, then it can only be called with a String value. In the latter case, the call to ToString in IsWellFormedCurrencyCode is unnecessary."},{"commentid":12221,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"ecmascriptbugs","name":"Norbert"},"bug_when":"2015-02-08 14:04:49 -0800","thetext":"Fixed in 2013-02-28 draft."}]}}

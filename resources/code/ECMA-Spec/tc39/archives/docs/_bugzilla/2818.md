They should either use the same steps, or call an abstract operation performing these steps to avoid duplication.\n\nImportantly, the first of these two states that the [[RealmRecord]]'s `intrinsics` record should be used as the source of the values, whereas the second doesn't specify a source at all.\n\nAdditionally, 26.2.3.4 also handles the intrinsics, and also doesn't refer to the [[RealmRecord]]'s `intrinsics` record. (At least not directly, step 6b probably boils down to that, but isn't entirely clear.)"},{"commentid":13763,"comment_count":1,"who":{"uid":"allen","name":"Allen Wirfs-Brock"},"bug_when":"2015-03-16 14:38:10 -0700","thetext":"concerns reified Realm objects which were dropped from ES6"}]}}

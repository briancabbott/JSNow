<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Today ES classes are currently limited to declarative specification of 
methods, but declarative specification of fields is left to ad-hoc expando 
mutations on class instances in various places.</p>

<p>This proposal aims to provide a declarative mechanism for specifying fields
intended to be placed on classes. Such a mechanism is useful for both developers
and tooling alike as it provides a place to specify the intended properties.</p>

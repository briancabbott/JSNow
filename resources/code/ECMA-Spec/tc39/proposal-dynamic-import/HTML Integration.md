# HTML Integration for `import()`

The `import()` proposal has been integrated into the [HTML Standard](http://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/): see the definition of [HostImportModuleDynamically](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#hostimportmoduledynamically(referencingscriptormodule%2C-specifier%2C-promisecapability)) there, and the supporting infrastructure put in place via [whatwg/html#3044](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/3044).

-------------

Syntax highlighting has been completely overhauled. The new syntax definition provides better support for modern JavaScript and better compatibility with existing color schemes and tools.

A few examples of improvements and bug fixes:

- JSX fragments are fully supported.
- Anonymous classes work correctly.
- Missing optional semicolons do not break highlighting.
- Regular expressions are always correctly detected.

This is a major change. The new syntax definition has been extensively tested in beta, but if you have any problems then please don't hesitate to report them at https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime/issues.

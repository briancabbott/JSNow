## In-person meeting

- Sven to try to setup the scheduling. Ask Gatsby/Vue or other oss projects on how they do it?
- Mostly likely, in the U.S.

## Foundation

- We should we close the issue

## Issue Triage

- Meta-analysis of issues: after 7, have a lot of issues, old issues, etc. Can we batch up things and create solutions in general whether it's generic bug fixes, better docs, new features? Example: monorepo support
- Re-enable stale robot?
- Clarify on what we should work
- Better labeling/categorizing
- Introducing a "need triage" label, eslint does this https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9699#event-1379473722

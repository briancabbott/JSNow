## Core Meeting

- Agreed on new meeting time!

## Community Meeting

- Sven: idea from firefox devtools team
- We've never tried it before, how many people will show up, is it useful?
- Would be better suited for previous contributors vs. turn into in-person GitHub issues.
- Other examples: [Probot](https://probot.github.io/community/), [Primer](https://spectrum.chat/primer/office-hours)

Let's think about it more.

## Local Meetings

- Are there other open source projects that have meetups like this? Should do some research and ask.
- Can be a contributor workshop/hackathon vs. just "speakers"
- Cooperate with an existing conference/meetup? (So we don't end up making our own meetup)
- Can use some WeWork/company space, or do a workshop at a company?
- Or what about a university/school?

Goals: in-person seems more effective to bring people in. Don't just be a meetup, focus on community building vs. speakers?

## Nicolo's Class PR

- [ ] Need to review! https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/8130

## Podcast!

From https://twitter.com/left_pad/status/1046045638612406274

- Goals: similar to the in-person meetup.
- Could be interesting to interview multiple kinds of people (not just well-known): whether they are in a different field, new to coding, in another language, or on TC39?
- Talk about our own struggles, day to day development (e.g. why babel 7 took so long, why implementing proposals are hard)

## Meta

How can we bring up new maintainers?

- Can we help against fears of getting involved?
  - Lack of self-confidence in undertaking something new, and overestimate the skill of existing maintainers?
  - Potential contributors think everything is "done", while we might believe that everything needs help ðŸ˜‚
  - A desire to do "tasks" rather than have the freedom to explore new ideas or work on things that no one else is thinking about
  - Too much focus on the "code", what about documentation, education, infrastructure, ease of use, speed, etc. What about different mediums (blog post, social media, art, video, podcast, etc)? What about support (issues, twitter, slack)?
- Onboarding and confidence
  - Even after adding someone as a contributor, they may not feel comfortable pressing the merge button
  - Need better release/maintainer docs, knowing what we even do should make it easier to optimize/change for the better.

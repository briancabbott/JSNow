# Babel configuration examples

Configuring Babel can be hard, especially when you want to compile a package from another package, a specific dependency or all of them, or when you have shared files accross different packages.

This repository contains different examples to cover all those usecase: if you don't think that we are showing your current setup, please open a PR or an issue!

To run a specific example, run the following commands:
```
cd 00-example-folder-you-want-to-test
npm i
npm start
```

Before checking the examples, it is strongly reccomended to read our documentation: [Config Files](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files), [Config Loading options](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/options#config-loading-options) and [Config Merging options](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/options#config-merging-options).

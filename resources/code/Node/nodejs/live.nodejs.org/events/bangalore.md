## Free Workshop: Building Real-Time IoT Applications Using Open Source ZettaJS

Node.js Foundation Member Apigee invites you to attend a free 3-hour IoT workshop which takes place the morning of Node.js Live Bengaluru, March 19, 2016 from 9:30 AM to 12:30 PM (IST).

Why Attend:

The Internet of Things revolves around increased machine-to-machine communication; it’s built on cloud computing and networks of data-gathering sensors; it’s mobile, virtual, and instantaneous connection; and they say it’s going to make everything in our lives from streetlights to seaports “smart.”

#### [Ashley Williams](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams)

Ashley, npm's Developer Community and Content Manager, gives a quick tour of npm’s greatest
features, old and new, and demonstrates how they can be integrated into your workflow to make
you better, happier, and more productive. Ashley will outline the most commonly used npm tools
for starting a project, managing a project through development, test, and deployment, and
managing teams and organization project work. She’ll focus in particular on workflows that
will help frontend developers, npm’s biggest and fastest-growing group of users.

##### [Niranjan Janardhana](https://github.com/Niranjan-J007)

Kraken is a secure and scalable layer that extends nodejs by providing structure and
convention. It also supports private NPM for enterprise.

Topics to be covered.
* NodeJS & security
* Npm & private hosting
* Internationalization support

#### [Gireesh Punathil](https://github.com/gireeshpunathil)

Memory Leaks leading to undesired growth and exhaustion of memory are by
far the most common production problem reported on enterprise scale Node applications.
Closures, a powerful semantic feature in functional programs which are used pervasively
in Node.js/Javascript programs to support their asynchronous and event driven programming
model, are a prominent source of unanticipated memory leaks.

In this presentation, I will explain three of the most common use cases where
Closures are used in Node. For each of the use cases, I will explain a) sample code, b)
the life-span of the Closure context and which variables the closure keeps live, iii)
what memory will be retained during the life-span of the Closure. The intention is to
help the audience better understand the execution environment of Closures, their
implications to memory footprint, and help them develop efficient code.

#### [Harminder Virk](https://github.com/thetutlage)

Adonis Js is a different breed of framework in NodeJs. It follows some great concepts of Dependency Injection and leverages the full power of ES6 by using Proxies, ES6 generators etc.

Topics to be covered.

Why AdonisJs?
New way to inject dependencies and writing testable code
What the heck are ES6 proxies?

#### Balachandra Kamat

In web-app design, node.js plays a crucial role in orchestrating user requests between
different backend systems. Owing to its architecture, low memory footprint, and active
community it is found to be a great fit for applications that demand high-performance
and scalability, real-time visualization of data and modernizing legacy systems.

Across industries we are seeing many usecases for leveraging node along with
technologies like AngularJs, MongoDB, Kafka & Storm. Some of the key scenarios
that we will call out in this presentation

1. Modernization of legacy mainframe applications using MEAN stack
2. Leveraging NodeJs & AngularJs to improve the scalability & performance of
internet scale applications Real time visualization of events leveraging Kafka,
Storm and MEAN Stack

# Speakers

#### [Mikeal Rogers](https://twitter.com/mikeal)

Mikeal is the Community Manager of the Node.js Foundation and the creator of
[request](https://github.com/request/request) and [NodeConf](http://www.nodeconf.com).

His talk will be all about what the Foundation has been up to recently and its plans for
the rest of 2016.

#### [Ashley Williams](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams)

Ashley, npm's Developer Community and Content Manager, gives a quick tour of npm’s greatest
features, old and new, and demonstrates how they can be integrated into your workflow to make
you better, happier, and more productive. Ashley will outline the most commonly used npm tools
for starting a project, managing a project through development, test, and deployment, and
managing teams and organization project work. She’ll focus in particular on workflows that
will help frontend developers, npm’s biggest and fastest-growing group of users.

#### [Josh Emerson](https://github.com/joshje)

Josh Emerson is a web developer who likes to use technology to create frictionless solutions to genuine human needs. He's worked at agencies and startups, and now works at Snyk, where he's building tools which help the npm community to create and use open source software more securely.

#### [Mete Atamel](https://github.com/meteatamel)

Mete is a Developer Advocate at Google, currently focused on helping developers with Google Cloud Platform. Prior to Google, he worked as a Software Engineer at Microsoft, Skype, Adobe, EMC, and Nokia building apps and services on various web, mobile and cloud technologies.

#### [Gareth Ellis](https://github.com/gareth-ellis)

Gareth has been working in the area of Runtime Performance Analysis at IBM since 2012. Originally concentrating on Java, he has now moved to concentrating more on Node.js. He is also a regular attendee to the benchmarking workgroup, and has contributed to the benchmarks being run on a nightly basis.

Benchmarks and the information they provide are important to ensure that changes going into Node.js don't regress key attributes like startup speed, memory footprint and throughput.
This talk will cover an introduction to benchmarking & key challenges, approaches to benchmarking Node.js & identifying regressions, the Node.js benchmarking workgroup's current benchmarks and use case scenarios, and how to get involved.

#### [Luke Bond](https://twitter.com/lukeb0nd)
Luke has been working as a back-end developer for many years, currently with Node.js and Linux Containers at YLD, and previously at Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. A developer with a diverse background, he has battle-tested experience delivering solid solutions to production. Luke built an open-source, container-based PaaS called Paz (http://paz.sh) and has delivered talks at CoreOS Fest, Container Camp, Docker London, Node on the Road Lisbon, and various London Node, container and DevOps meetups. Luke currently helps YLD's customers embrace Continuous Delivery and to put DevOps philosophies into practice.

Almost all Node.js deployments in production are running on Linux. This talk explores the nuts and bolts of the average Node.js application running on Linux, focusing on process monitoring options like PM2 and systemd, as well as clustering and service discovery considerations.


#### [Alexander Gugel](https://github.com/alexanderGugel)

Alex is currently contracting at Sky, where he is working on a centralised editorial system for NowTV. He previously worked at Famous in Amsterdam and SF, building a WebGL / DOM rendering engine. Alex is obsessed with package management, RxJS and ES proposals. He has a love affair with Go, even though his true love will always be Node.js.

Alex will be talking about [ied](https://github.com/alexanderGugel/ied), an alternative package manager for Node.js. He is going to focus on the challenges he faced when writing a package manager for Node.js, how ied's architecture is different from npm's and why it results into better performance.

# Speakers

#### [Ashley Williams](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams)

Ashley, npm's Developer Community and Content Manager, gives a quick tour of npm’s greatest
features, old and new, and demonstrates how they can be integrated into your workflow to make
you better, happier, and more productive. Ashley will outline the most commonly used npm tools
for starting a project, managing a project through development, test, and deployment, and
managing teams and organization project work. She’ll focus in particular on workflows that
will help frontend developers, npm’s biggest and fastest-growing group of users.  

#### [Thomas Watson](https://github.com/watson)

Thomas is a member of the Node.js Tracing Working Group and a full time open source developer at Opbeat. He enjoys working on mad science projects with Node.js and for some odd reason gets a kick out of implementing network protocols in JavaScript.  

This talk covers different approaches of instrumenting a Node.js application. If applied correctly, instrumentation will allow you to discover bottlenecks or track and log application usage - even in production, without sacrificing performance. Part one will cover the current state of tracing and instrumentation. In part two we’ll take a look at the next-gen core tracing API's being developed under the Node.js Tracing Working Group.

#### [Gareth Ellis](https://github.com/gareth-ellis)

Gareth has been working in the area of Runtime Performance Analysis at IBM since 2012. Originally concentrating on Java, he has now moved to concentrating more on Node.js. He is also a regular attendee to the benchmarking workgroup, and has contributed to the benchmarks being run on a nightly basis.

Benchmarks and the information they provide are important to ensure that changes going into Node.js don't regress key attributes like startup speed, memory footprint and throughput.
This talk will cover an introduction to benchmarking & key challenges, approaches to benchmarking Node.js & identifying regressions, the Node.js benchmarking workgroup's current benchmarks and use case scenarios, and how to get involved.

#### [Igor Soarez](https://github.com/Soarez)

Igor Soarez is a Principal Engineer at YLD. He works as a consultant for organisations managing big deployments, validating and advising on architectural choices and delivery process. Over the past two years, Igor has led teams working on Node-related high-visibility projects for big enterprises. He has also designed and ran Node.js training courses for both private clients and public conferences.  

As Node continues to go from strength to strength, being widely adopted not only within the startup community but more and more by the Enterprise community, a number of anti-patterns are beginning to emerge. This talk focuses on the strengths of JavaScript in the Enterprise by trying to isolate the anti-patterns that are slowly beginning to emerge.   

#### [Mikeal Rogers](https://twitter.com/mikeal)

Mikeal is the Community Manager of the Node.js Foundation and the creator of
[request](https://github.com/request/request) and [NodeConf](http://www.nodeconf.com).

Mikeal will be sharing what the Node Foundation has been up to recently and its plans for
the rest of 2016.

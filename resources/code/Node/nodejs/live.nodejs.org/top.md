<h2>Node.js Live</h2>
<p>The Node.js Foundation is kicking off a series of global events bringing together local Node.js developers around the world.</p>
<p>Each event is different and tailored to the local community, varying in length and in some cases in partnership with local Node.js groups and users.</p>

# User journey documentation
Diagnostic user journeys are coherent set of step-by-step procedures,
that a user follows for problem determination of reported issues.
The documentation project is organized based on user journey.
Each user journey is contained in one top level folder by that name.

For each user journey:
  -  Readme.md contains a high level overview of what use case this flow is addressing
  - setup.md may contain pre-requisites for the system to be able to follow diagnostics
  - investigation_flow.md may contain high level steps on the problem determination
  - case_study.md may contain an investigation of a specific use case with real data
  - step1, step2, .. may contain different tools / methods to solve the same problem

## Agenda

## Announcements
 
*Extracted from **diag-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* lib: create diagnostics_channel module [#34895](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/34895)
  * (missed the start)
  * added some events to http module
    * get the complete lifecycle of http request
    * Has a test showing a simple APM with zero patching
    * Performance compared to monkey patching is better but not significantly
  * Goal in the future is to improve performance further
  * Simplistic spam API
    * Object used to express sequence of events
    * Wraps another object and adds an object ID to it
    * Doesn’t add timestamps or anything like that, it’s up to consumer to correlate events and time them
  * Need reviews
  * No outstanding objections
    * Note about the name
    * Is “shouldPublish” the right name?
    * etc. small nits wrt naming
  * Should be merged as experimental


### nodejs/diagnostics

* \[async_hooks\] stable API - tracking issue [#124](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/124)
  * One small thing: issue with an API that doesn’t correctly reuse the context
    * https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/35188
    * Uncertainty on what should be the correct behavior
    * Need more eyes/reviews/comments 

* Add ioredis to problematic-modules.md #430
  * It was created because there was a few PRs opened to these modules, and because async_hooks are experimental those PRs were rejected, so the WG wanted a way to keep track of things that need to be fixed.
  * The wording is not great
  * The way forward is for us to get at least AsyncResource and AsyncLocalStorage, and then we can start doing some about these modules
  * Move the document to an issue
  * The reason is not super well known
  * AI: Mary will create an issue
  * How to track if the module is fixed?
    * With an issue, PR authors can reference
     * Use separate issues for each module, add code examples

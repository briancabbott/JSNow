## Agenda
 
*Extracted from **diag-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* lib: add span API to diagnostics_channel [#35534](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/35534)
* lib: make diagnostics_channel async iterable  [#35532](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/35532)
  * Both PRs need review
  * Mary will try to get to it today or tomorrow
  * Gireesh is good with the PR that landed, but from span API PR is a bit difficult to understand how the span will going to be used within the diagnostics channel.
    * Span API was removed from original proposal to reduce complexity
    * Is this absolutely essential? Does this need to be an add on?
    * Mary: Good to ask both question (how to use API and is it even necessary)
  * Michael has looked at them but not sure on the complexity/benefit on these 2. Agree with
    Gireesh that the original Diagnostic channel PR was good and great that it landed.
  * Mary: maybe we should set a target for minimum number of producers (frameworks) before adding new features

* Proposal: mark AsyncResource and AsyncLocalStorage as stable [#35286](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/35286)
  * Next steps are to define `exit` criteria for AsyncLocalStorage.  Seems like there was already
    consensus that AsyncResource can exit, but some questions if it makes sense to do one with
    the other.

* Node.js' internal scripts should be hidden in the inspector. [#11893](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/11893)
  * call for action: who wants to work on this?
    * Rafael would like to help with this issue

### nodejs/diagnostics

* Improve the V8 Profiler performance [#444](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/444)
  * Created because the CPU Profiler Roadmap was done.
  * The remaining task is to improve V8 CPU Profiler performance for production environments on startup.
  * Should we add a benchmark on [node/benchmark](https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/master/benchmark)? Sould like a good idea

* Identify async_hooks use cases beyond AsyncLocalStorage [#437](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/issues/437)
	* No update
            * Suggestion to move to deep dive
* Add ioredis to problematic-modules.md [#430](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/pull/430)
  * Mary still needs to create the issues here

* Question about agenda vs deep dive
  * Weâ€™ll try to use more meetings to deep dive moving forward, when there are no urgent items on the agenda
* Meeting time
  * Should be discussed in the issue to avoid timezone bias

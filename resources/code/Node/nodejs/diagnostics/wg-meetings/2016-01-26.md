Agenda
================================================================================

* trace-event is now in V8 4.9; [#30 - next steps](https://github.com/nodejs/tracing-wg/issues/30)

* need more meat / structure in the [#31 - use cases issue](https://github.com/nodejs/tracing-wg/issues/31)

* AsyncWrap
  * [node #3504 - async_wrap](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/3504): make native
    API public is unlikely to land. What are the alternatives for integrating
    native addons with AsyncWrap?
  * Follow up on http fix and making MakeCallback reentrant:
    * [node #4509 - Fix async wrap http](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4509)
    * [node #4507 - src: fix MakeCallback error handling](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4507)

## [5:36](https://youtu.be/DvQ7QSyEe64?t=336) - trace events

* node branch now available to play with - [issue comment](https://github.com/nodejs/tracing-wg/issues/38#issuecomment-174623789)

* What work can we do in parallel to work Google is doing?
  * what will Google folks be providing?

* What does a trace event look like in the code, including passing data?

* How do we expose the trace buffer to whoever wants to read the trace events?
  * only via special build?
  * provided in existing node build, via native add-on?

* What trace events do we actually provide?
  * very low overhead, and configurable, so we probably want to add a bunch
  * grouped via categories - a grouping mechanism provided by the tracing
    infrastructure

* Probably don't want to have events themselves surface back through JavaScript,
  kills the overhead.

* But probably want to think about configuring the tracing via some kind of API;
  start/stop tracing, configuring what trace categories are enabled, where does
  tracing output go.  This API might be only exposed via native add-ons first,
  and then later higher in JS if we find a nice set.

* What are the constraints on the data we can add to a trace event.  Eg, presumably
  won't be pointers to things that can move / be freed, since trace events are
  "read" long after events occur.

* Can we allow users to emit events from JavaScript?

* Pat wants to create a couple of issues to focus on some of the particular
  questions.

  * how do expose trace events to the user
  * apis to start/stop/configure tracing
  * what are we going to put trace events around


## [31:07](https://youtu.be/DvQ7QSyEe64?t=1867) - async wrap status

* native addons integrated with AsyncWrap

  * [node #3504- async_wrap: make native API public](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/3504)
  * Can we do this?  Currently seems impossible | hard; because this exposes
    some internal stuff that we wouldn't want to.  Trevor will look into some
    techniques to do this.

* http fix / MakeCallback being re-entrant

  * [node #4509 - Fix async wrap http](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4509)
  * [node #4507 - src: fix MakeCallback error handling](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/4507)
    * note that this PR has been merged

## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **diag-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* PR for new JSFunction-based PromiseHook API is open! Please, take a look. nodejs/node#36394

  * alternative to the existing PromiseHook API in V8 using split JSFunctions per event type rather than the old way which routes everything through a single C++ function even though it's just going right back to JS in the end. This shows great performance improvements in the known benchmarks. The CL is open at upstream v8, this PR is to track progress, and awareness.

  * This marks the last meeting of the year, the next one falls on general holiday period. Will regroup in 2021

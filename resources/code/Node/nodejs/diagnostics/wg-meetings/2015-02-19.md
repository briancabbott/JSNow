# Agenda

* What is trace\_event?
    * What is/are the primary use case(s)? (e.g. counters, perf tracing, async 
      call continuation)
* Status of: 
  [https://codereview.chromium.org/827993003](https://codereview.chromium.org/827993003)
* What tools are using it?
* How would it be implemented?
    * What features would io.js leverage?
    * How would it affect existing subsystems?
    * (currently test/ doesn't have an examples of how to use 
      include/v8-tracing.h)
* How does this feed into current API (i.e. AsyncWrap)?
* What is left to do?
* Why is the debugging port so slow in io.js and node.js 0.12?
    * [https://github.com/iojs/io.js/issues/877](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/issues/877)
* Can/should tracing be exposed by iojs? via c++? via js?
    * Anything in deps/v8/include/ can be accessed by native modules. So the 
      question should be: What parts do we want to integrate into core?
* Can we share async tracing facilities between iojs and chrome? (eg: Promises)
    * see: window.fetch()

# Notes:

What is trace\_event?

* Created for client side analysis in Chrome
    * Chrome is multi-threaded and needed additional information
* 1) Data format (JSON)
* 2) (C++) Is a way to place probes throughout the codebase 
* trace-event.h bottoms out in 3-4 C++ calls w/ specific purposes
    * The macros turn into those few calls
* To use v8-tracing.h, copy in tracing-event.h to have macro's use the internal 
  API
* 2 parts
    * Embedding API
    * Control API (stop, start, get data, get categories)
* Chrome dev tools protocol has JS APIs for control
* Does not call at the moment a specific probe is called. Is less performance 
  intrusive.

Status of V8 patch?

* Month to land? 
  * fadi: yes

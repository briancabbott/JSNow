JOINING_INSTRUCTIONS="Google Hangouts; link will be posted here shortly before the meeting starts.

A standing invitation exists for all @nodejs/TSC members who are not also CommComm members to attend in observer capacity.

## Public participation

We stream our conference call straight to YouTube so anyone can listen to it live, it should start playing at **https://www.youtube.com/c/nodejs+foundation/live** when we turn it on. There's usually a short cat-herding time at the start of the meeting and then occasionally we have some quick private business to attend to before we can start recording & streaming. So be patient and it should show up.

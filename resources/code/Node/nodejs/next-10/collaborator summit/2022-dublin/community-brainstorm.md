|---|---|---|
| Collaborator profile / Growing collaborators / Succession plannig & technical talent pool / existing collaborators   | Increase corporate contributions: getting a few unicorn startups and companies to allocate some engineers to Node.js / Keeping the lights on, build, security releases / Corporate Investment: How do we make it happen?  | new  |
| Attracting new collaborators / Making your first contribution / newcomers / Engage and help people wanting to collaborate & help (Collaborator Summit is great but Covid)  | Funnel contributor onboarding into relevant working groups / Communication about initiative and help people to be involved / Could use more followup after Code & Learns / Onboarding the next generation: what happens when we all die |  = |
| Consensus process / PR review & approval flow  | Education  | new  |
| More communication about initiative  | Enabling larger initiatives  | +1  |
| Large & significant changes  | Further built in tooling  | +3  |
| Mentorship programm is a good idea (but maybe with a bit more follow up)  | Being well welcomed in WG / being well welcomed in working group  |  -5 |
| Leadership / Leadership model  | Faster startup time  | new  |
| Build technology, flow to being able to test  | Sustainable outreach / Adjacent community engagement  | new  |

> Need to work on better follow up with new contributor

> How to have bigger initiatives?

## Obstacles

| 2021  | 2022  | Change  |
|---|---|---|
| Current consensus seeking model / Finding consensus is difficult sometimes / Some MR are blocked for a long time (some others are quite fast) / hard to reach consensus on issue (long discussion lead to collaborator burnout)  | Flaky CI / CI reliability / Flaky CITGM / CI time  |   |
| Different agendas & goals  | Lack of "good first issues"  | new  |
| How to contribute and help people understanding how to contribute & guide them (example, tuto, pair programming)  | Some niche or complicated areas have a really hard time getting reviews  | +2  |
| Timezones  | Communicating with the community about adding npm module functionalities into core  | new  |
| Certain areas have too few knowledgeable people involved (stream, crypto) | ESM and CJS interoperability in npm module: do we have a recommandation for the community?  | new  |
| PRs get staled due to lack of reviews  | A lot of different topic, how to prioritize  | +1  |
| Size of the project  | Timezone / Meeting time for WG  | -3  |
| Jenkins logs hard to navigate for newcomers  | Primordials  | new  |
| Long build times in developments (increase barrier unless you have a powerfull machine)  | Money  | new  |
|   | Corporate priorities  | new  |
|   | OpenJS Fundation limitations | new  |
|   | Burnout  | new  |
|   | Not getting enough contribution from the ecosystem  | new  |
|   | Work more asynchronously  | new  |

> Area without enough contributors (project size, burnout, ...)

> timezone is still an issue

> tests/build is long and log can be hard

> money/corporate support was a big talk

## Working well

| 2021  | 2022  | Change  |
|---|---|---|
| Active working group / working groups / Online WG is a great way for people to join and start to collaborate  | Collaborator Summit  |   |
| Release cadence  | Onboarding new collaborators  |   |
| Codeowner (still room for improvement)  | PR process  |   |
| Automation  | New collaborators (seems a lot new people this year than before)  |   |
|   | OpenSSF contribution to make Node.js more secure  |   |
|   | Making sure the ecosystem is stable and breaking changes are few. Few complaintes from the ecosystem |   |
|   | Automating away a lot of things with labels and GitHub Actions has made the contributing experience friendlier |   |

> Working group onboarding collaborator and people joining seems fine

> automation played a key role on helping members

> PR speed seems to be better

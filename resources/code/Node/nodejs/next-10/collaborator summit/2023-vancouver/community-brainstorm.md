## Obstacles

| 2022  | 2023  | Change  |
|---|---|---|
| Flaky CI / CI reliability / Flaky CITGM / CI time  | Node.js core is very complex for new contributors / Mentorship/new contributor on-ramp / Extremely hard ramp up to become a prolific maintainer of Node.js / Maintainer Sustainability / It's often unclear to first time contributors who are the primary reviewers of certain areas of the project.   | +1  |
| Lack of "good first issues"  | npm / Lack of standardization/specification of package.json   | +3 (new functions?)  |
| Some niche or complicated areas have a really hard time getting reviews  | flaky CI / node.js ci / Flaky tests  | -3  |
| Communicating with the community about adding npm module functionalities into core  | CI performance, especially on not common combination / CI UX / CI/CD  | -4 |
| ESM and CJS interoperability in npm module: do we have a recommandation for the community? | Bun / other javascript runtime. It's will create confusion for junior javascript dev / Deno  | new  |
| A lot of different topic, how to prioritize  | CJS   | -1  |
| Timezone / Meeting time for WG  | rigidly adhering to web api choices adds burden for node users   | new  |
| Primordials  | Slack is quite big and sometimes is hard to know where to ask specific questions  | new  |
| Money  |   |   |
| Corporate priorities  |   |   |
| OpenJS Fundation limitations  |  |   |
| Burnout  |   |   |
| Not getting enough contribution from the ecosystem  |   |   |
| Work more asynchronously  |   |   |

> Flaky tests and CI are still an issue

> Hard to onboard / have contributor in specific area

> Lack of standards and some standards are only for web

| Automating away a lot of things with labels and GitHub Actions has made the contributing experience friendlier  | Youtube/meeting minutes/recording in public | new  |

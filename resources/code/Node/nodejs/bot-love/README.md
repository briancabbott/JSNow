### Notes From Original Meeting

#### Background Context
- Badges bot needs to be implemented
- years of bot need buildup
- we need to figure out how we can implement bots for the org
- need to reduce maintainer burden

#### Identify the processes/areas where bots can improve Node.js
- Automatically comment on Node.js core PRs when CI fails, with CI failure info
- Automatically opening backport PRs for review
- When flaky tests fail, automatically comment that the failing tests are flaky
- Moderation tooling - adding 
- respond with relevant intro information to new issues, first issues, first PRs, etc.
- Badges bot to assign badges to users
- Surface old issues or PRs

A _lot_ of what we want to do has already been built with Probot:

#### Identify how we can begin implmenting bots

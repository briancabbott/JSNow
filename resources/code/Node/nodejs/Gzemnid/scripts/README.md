# Gzemnid search scripts

This directory contains one-line convenience scripts (basically lz4cat + grep)
to perform searches on produced datasets. Also they serve as an example of how
the data could be queried and which files to look it.

You could use these or query the datasets manually.

These should be launched from the directory where the current dataset is placed.

## Contribution Guidelines

While you're working on contributions, and submitting pull requests (PRs) to add those contributions, to this project, please keep these guidelines in mind. We _expect_ submitted code, and its associated PR, to follow our standards. When submitting code, you can ensure you follow these standards by utilizing our .editorconfig file, located in the root folder of this repository. If these procedures are followed, fixing PRs to the satisfaction of both the submitter and the Website WG Contributors will be simplified greatly.

#### Code
* __One topic per PR:__ Please commit code/writing covering a single topic or feature with a single PR. The project is easier to maintain when we can easily grasp everything a PR is doing, and can reference each feature by individual PR in the future.

#### Pull Requests
* __PR Timeout__: If a PR has merge conflicts or one or more downvotes and the author of a PR doesn't respond to inquiries or requests posted to the PR issue, the PR will be closed at the discretion of a WG Contributor.
* __Controversial PRs:__ If a PR is controversial, it will be discussed by Contributors in the issue, and, if required, in the bi-weekly Website Working Group (WG) meeting.
* __Contributor votes for merge:__ WG members will need to approve, or +1, your contribution in order for it to be accepted and merged into the main repo.


## Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct is adapted from [Rust's wonderful
CoC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/wiki/Note-development-policy#conduct).

* We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
  environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
  disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic.
* Please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that
  might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
  all.
* Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every
  design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous
  costs. There is seldom a right answer.
* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid
  ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass
  anyone.  That is not welcome behaviour. We interpret the term
  "harassment" as including the definition in the [Citizen Code of
  Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/); if you have any lack of
  clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read
  their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that
  excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
* Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if
  you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable
  by a community member, please contact one of the channel ops or any
  of the TC members immediately with a capture (log, photo, email) of
  the harassment if possible.  Whether you're a regular Contributor or
  a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you
  and we've got your back.
* Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other
  attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.
* Avoid the use of personal pronouns in code comments or
  documentation. There is no need to address persons when explaining
  code (e.g. "When the developer")

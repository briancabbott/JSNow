* Auto closing old stale PRs [#42981](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/42981)

## Strategic Initiatives

### Startup performace

* Landed <https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/3616553> to improve memory safety of the custom snapshots but later reverted it due to regressions - working on a reland.
* Also opened <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=12921> to discuss about possible solutions to ensure memory safety of read-only snapshots in V8. Continuing work on this issue.
* mkcodecache is gone after <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/43023>, the code cache is now part of Node.js's custom snapshot.

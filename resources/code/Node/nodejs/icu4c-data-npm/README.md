# `icu4c-data`

An ICU4C Data Packager for Node.js

> Note: This module may become obsolete, please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/unicode-org/full-icu-npm/issues/36) accordingly. No updates have been planned for ICU 65 and above, in regards to little endian Intel systems.

## About `icu4c-data`

This is the data package builder for the [full-icu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/full-icu) module. Please refer to [full-icu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/full-icu) if you only want to install ICU data.

## Use: Building the data

To use this module: first acquire the data file, such as `icudt58l.dat` from an ICU build, or from the official ICU source tarball (.tgz/.zip).

1. You can use the following script to do so in `bash`:

```
bash fetchdata.sh 58.2
```

2. Then publish the little-endian file

```
npm run gen -- icudt58l.dat
```

This will output a line labelled 'run this command' (starting with `rm â€¦`). Run that command after each time you execute `npm run gen`.

3. Now publish the big endian file.

`npm run gen -- icudt58b.dat`

> Remember to run the commands as instructed in section 2.

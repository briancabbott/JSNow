![IO.js Logo](http://acirdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/iojs-logo_500x500.png?ts=2 "IO.js Logo")  

A simple, vibrant logo for the Evented IO for V8 JavaScript.


### Study and Motivation
The logo was inspired by the vibrant and common visual language defined by the other more famous
community's logos: the official JS and the Node JS ones.  

I've decided to use a simple hexagonal form, inscribed in a square, to mantain a continuity with the Node JS logo, overlapped on other two hexagon, to give the idea of a moving fast technology, with a particular attenction to a positive and collaborative future.  


### Colors
All logo's colors are similar to the JS ones:  
geometric hexagon comes with a yellow scale, starting from a relaxing #f2df61, ending with a 
lighter #fbf3c6, while font color is the classic #2e2e2c.  


### Font family
The font family is [Neutraface 2](http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface2), not the same of the JS logo, but a relatad one, from the same font foundry, [Houseind](http://www.houseind.com/).

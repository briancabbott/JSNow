![welcome-taco](https://media.giphy.com/media/l2JHZ0dIcyFo5UQGQ/giphy.gif)

Here we will ask fun questions like, 'what is education in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)?' 

Notice we didn't say 'answer'? This [repository](http://techterms.com/definition/repository) exists to explore what it means to be learning Node.js. Who uses it? How are folks learning it? How can we as a community make the experience better and inclusive for existing users and  rad, diverse group of learners? 

- Looking for a few resources on how to start learning Node.js? [Check out our Getting Started](https://github.com/nodejs/getting-started)
- Hop into [the Help repo](https://github.com/nodejs/help) to ask questions from our team of helpful contributors.
- Interested in the Node.js Foundation Certification? [Look no further!](https://github.com/nodejs-certified-developer/certification)
- Want an introduction to diversity inclusion, and unconscious bias? [Try this free training offered by our partners at the Linux Foundation](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/linux-courses/open-source-compliance-courses/inclusive-speaker-orientation).

Please participate. File issues, PRs, and create the community you'd like to be a part of. If you need inspiration or have questions that you'd like to ask outside of issues, reach out to @hackygolucky on GitHub, Slack, or Twitter.

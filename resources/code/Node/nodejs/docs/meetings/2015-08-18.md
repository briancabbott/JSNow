## Minutes

### Governance
https://github.com/nodejs/docs/pull/14
* governance PR open
* merge that, or otherwise solidify process
* PR
   * chris
      * boilerplate-y
      * steps on the toes of other .mds we have
      * would like to have a governance.md
   * drew
      * liked what we have, PR seemed a bit heavy
      * perhaps move what we have (getting-started.md) to governance.md
      * perhaps merge in that parts of the PR that we like
   * chris
      * PR points to where the members are listed, and code of conduct
      * leans towards the getting-started.md
      * maybe start with a stripped-down governance.md
   * action
      * update PR with a smaller scope
      * volunteers? bryan




### Build/Website Integration
* talked about a bunch at node summit
* website WG uses metalsmith
* leaning towards mdast
* sean: website WG
   * trying to make publishing process streamlined for needs of many working groups
   * manage different i18ns
   * don't want to duplicate a bunch of tooling
      * coherence for users
   * website repo/WG -- build tooling
      * docs WG can help evolve tooling
   * website group/repo -- styling, etc
   * docs WG -- lean, content oriented
   * website WG -- eventually split off tooling
* chris: ask from docs WG
   * move towards mdast
   * linting, link checking, etc
   * adding "introduced in" etc tags
   * metalsmith plugin to use mdast
   * could website WG move to mdast?
* sean:
   * yeah, mdast should be fine, has other nice benefits
   * website WG is pretty early, can make changes
* chris:
   * getting docs WG content into the website repo
   * PRs temporarily until there's a better solution?
* sean:
   * website isn't published yet
   * coming weeks
   * cowboy days, process doesn't matter too much
   * … so maybe don't need the PRs approach yet




### Moving API Docs from `nodejs/node` to `nodejs/docs`


[Issue on node core](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/2366)
* chris:
   * talk on node repo about where API docs should live
   * sanguine on it living in the docs repo
   * core is pushing for API docs in node repo
   * if we say "we'll write docs for you" that's a massive commitment for docs WG
* sam:
   * not sure we can sell that
* chris:
   * yeah, just a hunch
* sam:
   * a code author (i.e. node repo contributor) might have a better idea of how to write the docs
   * if the code is hard to write docs for, that's an indication that perhaps the code/approach might need some review
   * in favor of API docs in node repo
* chris:
   * not super fixed on either approach
* sam:
   * for core author, easier to work on a single repo
   * a bunch of stuff in api docs isn't api docs:
      * errors
      * debugger page
      * addon page
      * examples
   * lots of stuff in current API docs which could be removed/moved
* sean:
   * “remove examples from api docs” was met with broad agreement at node summit meeting
   * api docs in node repo very bare-bones
   * if examples are needed can do cross linking
* stephen:
   * core repo should just contain API reference, examples/guides should move to docs repo
   * "needs-docs" tag for changes which need a more comprehensive guide, but shouldn't block
* chris:
   * worried about API docs separate from docs repo: assumes a world where the API docs don't link back to guides and tutorials
   * will need to be linking between API docs and guides/tutorials
   * … and such all docs need to be versioned together
   * suggest: pull API docs into docs repo, also leave in node repo, mass PR into node repo. merge conflict of english language is painful
* sam:
   * "leave the API docs in the core" doesn't include infrastructure, just the markdown in core
   * treat it as source, which would go into docs site build processes
   * would be happen for API docs in core repo to include references which would only make sense once those docs are published (AKA "up references" or "side references")
* drew:
   * had assumed that as well
* sam:
   * does that address concerns about linking?
* chris:
   * concerned about the artificial distance between the docs repo and api docs in core repo would get bigger
   * linking API docs to/from topics or guides gets tricky
* sam:
   * api docs
      * poorly organized
      * no overarching framework
      * no guides/priciples for writing API docs
   * apis aren't currently sufficiently documented in reference form
      * API changes made w/out API docs being updated
   * make it easier/mandatory for code PRs to include the needed API docs changes
   * make it easy for docs group to make over-arching docs
* bryan:
   * one concern
      * two separate contribution processes: one for docs repo and one for core repo (which has API docs)
      * if well documented (how to contribute) in our contributing guide, then that might be OK
* sean:
   * maintaining one set of API docs which represent the "edge" case of node.js
      * single version of docs which presents docs for all versions of node
   * this might make some things, especially crosslinking, easier (or less problematic)
   * editors of the guides, including API, are writing docs to the current version
   * someone using an older version are aware of deprecations etc
   * also gives visibility of how node.js has evolved
* drew:
   * had assumed that
* sam:
   * makes api in core easier or harder?
* sean:
   * perhaps harder -- do we maintain old APIs in core repo master?
* sam:
   * perhaps easier -- single source of truth
* chris:
   * when linking, difficulties figuring out which version to link to
   * do we want to make a lot of sweeping changes to API docs?
      * involves make a lot of changes in node repo
      * not sure if contribution process to node repo will work for sweeping changes to docs
      * … might stall docs, or produce worse docs
* sean:
   * argument for splitting the repo: i18n
   * already are i18n groups who are already doing wild west processes for translating API docs
      * no good place to link to
      * no good place to contribute to
   * approach of new website
      * base is english folder
      * separate folders per language
      * all language PRs are equal
   * sentiment to do something similar on docs repo
   * … do those start landing in core? get's noisy for core, bundling trickiness
   * consistent i18n of docs will make things easier for the docs team
* chris:
   * unified method for i18n process?
* sean:
   * yes
   * if english API docs are the only thing in a different place, might be weird
   * or sending translated docs to node repo, might be weird
* sam:
   * might not be weird
   * other i18n groups might catch up
   * … unless API docs start in another language
* sean:
   * i18n translators will need to clone and track two repos
* sam:
   * a big change to rip all the API docs out, to a docs site which hasn't produced docs yet
   * separate API docs approach, doesn't have to be that way forever
   * once docs WG is pushing out higher quality docs site, we could then take on ownership of API docs
* sean:
   * let's get a proof of concept going with all the other guides, tooling, etc
   * until then we're not ready to pull API docs out of core
* drew:
   * until then, docs WG could help figure out how to write API docs in a consistent way
* sam:
   * … to provide templates, markup, tools, etc
* chris:
   * chris's read: too scary of a change to rip out API docs until we've produced a website
   * proposes: slurping API docs, making our changes, then PR back our changes to core
   * once we have a site, propose an official move
   * not super optimistic about making changes of API docs while in core repo. core repo has a different pace, different set of goals
* time check
   * punting discussion of open PRs
* sean:
   * make a round of sweeping change, then push back to core?
   * … or keep cherry picking?
   * need a proposal
* chris:
   * make a round of sweeping changes, and PR it
   * if API changes, examine and pull them in
   * push/pull model, two sources
   * temporary until we prove we can build a website
* bryan:
   * instead of asking for a removal of API docs dir, get ownership of API docs dir [in node repo]?
* chris:
   * we can ask for that
   * distributed colab network in node repo, so getting the word out is difficult and takes time
* sam:
   * we effectively already own it, since we can already "LGTM" a docs PR
   * one difficulty with docs PR in node is just getting someone to _review_ the docs, so having a docs WG around to do that would help
* bryan:
   * clarification: ownership of docs directory in node core
* sean:
   * do some really quick house cleaning -- remove non-API docs from node repo
   * assets, tooling, etc (non-contentious stuff)
* chris:
   * one minute left
   * a couple of different avenues
   * chris will be talking at TSC meeting about this (most likely), will present the different strategies
   * will create a new issue for transition strategy
* wrap up
   * unsure when next meeting

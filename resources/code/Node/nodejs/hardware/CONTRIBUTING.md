Contributing to the Node.js Hardware Team
=========================================

So you're interested in helping the Hardware Team, that's awesome!

The Hardware Team is an open team. If you want to participate in a meaningful way, hop into the issues or Gitter!

## How To Contribute

The Hardware Team uses two communications mechanisms for all of our work.

All official work is done via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nodejs/hardware/issues). All documentation and initiatives are cataloged here, as well as some discussion of these topics. Discussion in these issues should be kept on-topic and brief to the extend possible, because these issues serve as documentation, as well as collaboration.

We also use [Gitter](https://gitter.im/nodejs/hardware), a chat system similar to IRC but based around GitHub. Gitter is used for all sorts of chat, from formulating raw ideas, to more free-form discussion of specific issues, to posting funny robot videos and cat gifs.

If you're interesting in participating, hop on in to Gitter and say hi! We'll give you some ideas on how and where you can help.

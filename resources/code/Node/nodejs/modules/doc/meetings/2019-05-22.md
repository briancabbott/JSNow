## Agenda

Extracted from **modules-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/modules

* Phase 3 update [#331](https://github.com/nodejs/modules/pull/331)
  - needs to be iterated based on the categories
  - geoff will update:
    - top-level phase 3 categories of In Progress, Done, Abandoned (nothing in Abandoned yet)
    - for each item, add a Status field e.g. “Stalled because of lack of consensus” or “Stalled because of upstream TC39 concerns” or “Implementation in progress” etc.

* Proposal: Support loading package by own "name" [#306](https://github.com/nodejs/modules/issues/306)
The name a package could use to refer to itself as an import or require. 
@@name@@:P
~name
Must be semver minor if we want it to get adoption in the next 3 years
Should not be a symbol that couldn’t possibly be on the file system
Import maps today would have an entry per “scope” for root. This would bloat the import map quite a bit.
Could be specced so roots dont need to be created per scope.
No rush as of yet to seek consensus

* An update about WASM modules and Env [29:50]
Cant import emscripten compiled wasm directly because it build wasm that expects symbols passed in from js (Env)
 Something might be missing in the modules system bigger than just node to pass in global like vars to modules that may or may not be shared as the loader wishes.
 realms  proposal was designed to expose compartmentalized globals to specific modules.
WASI will likely be useful

* Moving forward with Dynamic Modules? [#252](https://github.com/nodejs/modules/issues/252)

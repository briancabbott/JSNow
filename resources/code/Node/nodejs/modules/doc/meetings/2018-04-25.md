  - 40 minute time box
  - Use Cases Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BBsIqdAXB9JR2KUzQGYbCiVugYBnxE4REBakX29yyo/edit
    - JDalton:
      - Last week we transitioned from reviewing use-cases to extracting features from them.
      - Have tried to take a "yes, *and*" approach; no feature blocking
      - More use-cases added since
    - Geoffrey: added 36-38
      - (36) Users compile from CoffeeScript, some modules use CJS, some use ESM, need to interoperate among tests
      - Side note: any time CoffeeScript is mentioned, feel free to substitute in something like "Babel". Same concepts apply
      - (37) CoffeeScript has a tool called `coffee` that runs CoffeeScript code the same way `node` runs JavaScript code; however, `coffee` has no way of knowing whether a module has been written as an ES Module or a CommonJS module.
      - (38) Want to be able to just be able to eval some code and have it work the same way async/await just started working when it was added to the language.
    - Wesley Wigham
      - Want to be able to change as little code as possible when updating it; same way that when touching a file, a user might want to move from constructor functions to classes, or promises to async functions
      - Transparent fine-grained bidirectional interop with minimal required changes
    - Guy Bedford
      - (22) People are going to want to run this code in the browser as well; they will need to have some guidance and a way to build for the browser and Node that will run with as few edge-cases as possible?
      - Whatever ends up happening, semantics should be consistent in the browser and via bundled code shipped to the browser.
      - Saleh: having to use "browser-compatible paths" has been a general pain-point
	(meant `import path from ‘path’` is an illegal specifier for browsers - alternatives?)
        - Package name maps may actually address this issue.
    - Rob Palmer
      - (22) People don't like writing long sequences of `../../../[...]`.
        - JDD: Probably fits under specifier resolution; maybe specifier resolution customization.
      - (24) Also falls under the umbrella from custom specifier resolution
      - Assertion: this should all work without a build tool.
      - (25) Package encapsulation - ensuring only explicit named entrypoints/file can be importer by code outside the package
      - (26) Would like to have an alternative resolution strategy; potentially a resolver plugin.
    - (28) Want to be able to import dependencies and target the web without using any build tools
    - (29) consistent understanding between development tools (IDEs, build tools, etc.)
      - Could imagine that the resolution algorithm could be based around a plugin system
    - (30) JDD: still belives this relates to resolution customization
    - (31) Likely relates to transparent inteorp
    - (33) Need to wait on Justin to confirm what he has in mind.

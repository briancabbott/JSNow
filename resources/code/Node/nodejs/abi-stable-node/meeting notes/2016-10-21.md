**Topics of Discussion:**

*Module Registration and Initialization*
>Node v0.10 differs from rest of the later Node versions in Module registration and initialization functionality. Is it a good idea to 
support Node v0.10 for the prototype effrots considering the additional burden on the API desgin ?

After the debate the consensus was to accomodate this difference in the API design as a way to showcase the resiliancy of the design.

*Concerns about backward compatibility of modules*

Most likely NAPI is going to be introduced in a major Node version which will require modules to be recompiled with NAPI. Having an 
explicit field to capture NAPI module registartion is more desirable from a long term maintainenace perspective. 

*Indirect dependencies on V8*
>While porting NAPI to Node-ChakraCore using JSRT, Taylor brought up an issue of indirect V8 dependency in NAPI. e.g buffer uses V8 APIs for 
construction and initialization. Question was how should NAPI handle such indirect dependencies on V8?

The goal for NAPI is to abstract direct V8-dependecies for native modules. If these high level APIs are dependent on Node structures who 
have indirect V8 depdendencies, this should be handled when NodeCore adopts NAPI as part of VM-Nuetralilty. For now Node-ChakraCore should 
apply targted shimming approach to make the indirect V8 depdendencies work.

1. Module Registration and Initialization for Node v0.10 - Sampson

2. Handle Indirect dependencies on V8 via shim on Node-ChakraCore - Taylor

3. Run perf test on nanomsg - Taylor

4. iotivity conversion - Gabriel  

5. Open up known issues on the repo - Arunesh 

6. Prepare demo - Arunesh

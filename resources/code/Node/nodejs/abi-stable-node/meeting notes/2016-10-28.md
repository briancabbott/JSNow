**Status Update:**

*IoTivity conversion:*

`node_jsvmapi.h` has confusing comments referring to the need of `napi_set_external_data()` / `napi_get_external_data()`. 
This needs to be cleaned up because similar functionality is provided by the following API

`NODE_EXTERN void napi_wrap(napi_env e, napi_value jsObject, void* nativeObj, 
                            napi_destruct* napi_destructor, 
                            napi_weakref* handle);`

*Module Registration for Node v0.10:*

nanomsg is working with v0.10 and v6 without the need to recompile. Investigating a segfault when using it with LevelDown on v0.10

*Port NAPI to Node-ChakraCore using JSRT:*

Indirect dependecies on V8 (e.g buffer) is being shimmed - work almost done. Reviewing if there are any other such depdendencies. 

*Perf run on nanomsg benchmark:*

Done! NAPI overhead seems satisfactory. Taylor to share the results by updating [#8](https://github.com/nodejs/abi-stable-node/issues/8)

*Current known work items*

Filed all the current known work items as issues in the abi-stable-node repo

*NodeInteractive Demo*

Started looking into [Leveldown electron demo](https://github.com/Level/electron-demo), working through build issues.

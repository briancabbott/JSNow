- Int to String conversion API for nanomsg 
- Run nanomsg perf using NAPI on Linux

*Sampson*
- Look into porting NAPI to Node v0.12 

*Gabriel* 
- Started looking in building [iotivity](https://github.com/otcshare/iotivity-node) with NAPI 
- Investigating build issues 

*General Discussion*
- NAPI support for Node v0.10 may require additional work, which could potentially comlicate the API design due to differences in the Module registration and Initialization mechanism.
- How do we ensure NAPI modules to pass the version test at load time while being backward compatible with non-NAPI modules. Suggestion: use 0.0.0.0 for NM_VERSION

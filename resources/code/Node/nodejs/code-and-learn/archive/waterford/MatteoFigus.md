I'm Matteo, I work at OpenTable, I have been writing node.js for a couple of years now for production software.
Something I wrote is here: https://www.npmjs.com/~matteofigus

I'd like to write some Javascript. Maybe I can write some tests for improving test coverage on some areas.
I never took a look at node core code - first day today.
I am Italian, so I can help with italian docs translations too.

Thanks!

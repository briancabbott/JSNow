Hi, I'm Piotr and I'm from Poland.

Last year I graduated from University (Computer Science course).
I've been writing node applications (deployed to production) since January.

I think it could be fun to contribute some javascript to node.core (scince my c++ is very rusty and i've seen you're not using any .net :P).

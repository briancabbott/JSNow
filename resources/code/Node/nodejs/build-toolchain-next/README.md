# Future of Build Toolchain

The goals of the "Future of Build Toolchain" Strategic Initiative are:

  * Explore and test alternatives to the current build toolchain used by Node.js
  * Map existing personas and use cases that rely on the build toolchain
  * Prioritize personas, understanding what compromises are acceptable in the
    next build toolchain
    * Work with stakeholders to ensure compatibility with their use cases
  * Create a migration plan to move to a new build toolchain
  * Execute that plan

This repository is used to discuss anything related to this strategic
initiative, as well as to track its progress.

<h1 align="center">Node.js Mentorship</h1>

<p align="center">
  Achieve your goals by connecting with Node.js members and projects.
</p>

## üöÄ Get Involved

### Mentees

To get involved sign up for the [OpenJS Foundation Slack](https://slack-invite.openjsf.org/) workspace and join the #nodejs-mentorship channel. All announcements and opportunities will be posted there first. 

### Mentors

Our goal is to help ‚Äúfill in the gaps‚Äù on Initiatives and Working Groups that have important work to do, but a lack of people-power to accomplish it all. If this describes your group, you are our target audience!

We provide the people and you all provide the knowledge and support for getting them ramped up and providing value. Here‚Äôs what being a Mentor entails:

1. You fill out the Mentor Application form (it‚Äôs very short!) and open an issue on this repo letting us know you‚Äôve completed the form
2. We‚Äôll arrange a 1 hour ‚ÄúRequirements Gathering‚Äù meeting between you and the Mentorship Initiative where we work together to iron out exactly what your group needs in a Mentee, how soon, etc
3. The Mentorship Initiative designs, creates, and publishes an ‚ÄúOpportunity‚Äù, takes Applicants, and filters and sorts them down to our top recommendations based on the needs we discussed in the Requirements Gathering meeting
4. You choose which Applicant you‚Äôd like to take on as a Mentee and we connect you to each other
5. The Mentee starts attending your group meetings and you work with your new Mentee to identify some tasks or a small project they can work on and complete
6. When the Mentee has questions or needs additional context, you provide them with what they need, and ideally give them feedback on what they‚Äôre doing well and where they could improve; we encourage additional, periodic one-on-one meetings, but you and your Mentee are free to decide what works best in your particular case
7. Optimally, your Mentee will eventually become a full member of your Initiative or Working Group, and maybe even become a Mentor themselves

If anything out of the ordinary arises, the Mentorship Initiative is always here to offer guidance or provide solutions. If we don‚Äôt hear from you we will assume things are going well, and we will check in after a month from connecting you with your Mentee to see how things are going. This helps us fine-tune our process and ensure the mentorship relationship is working as intended.

And that‚Äôs pretty much it! If this sounds good to you and you're interested in mentoring someone for your Initiative or Working Group, go ahead and fill out¬†[this short form](https://nodejs.aidaform.com/node-js-initiative-group-application-mentor) and open an issue on this repo letting us know you've completed the form. We will get back to you about your application within 2 weeks.

## General Mentorship Details

The Mentorship initiative identifies specific needs of Initiatives and Working Groups within Node.js and posts applications for available opportunities. If there's a position you're interested in, please complete the application, and we'll get back to you about how you can help.

#### What does it mean to be a Mentee? 

In general, the Mentorship Initiative wants to bring passionate and talented people into the Node.js community.

As a mentee you will attend meetings with your Mentor and take on tasks related to the goals of the Initiative or Working Group you are in. This means getting up close and personal with some integral workings of one of the largest community based programming ecosystems in the world. 

During your time as a Mentee you will get to know many amazing members of the community. You'll also be able to make a direct and personal impact on the direction of the Node.js project through your work in your chosen Initiative or Working Group.

#### Mentee Commitment

Mentees should be self-motivated and professional. Our Mentors' time is valuable. They are there to offer support, insight, and answers, but you should be proactive about identifying the areas of greatest need and doing your best to help move things forward in those areas. This will require consistent time and effort on your part. One hour per week would be a bare minimum commitment on an Initiative or Working Group that holds biweekly meetings. More time would be required if meetings are held weekly, as time is needed to complete tasks outside of the meetings.

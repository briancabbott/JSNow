# Step 6: Initial Applicant Filtering (Week 6)

## Motivation

We have extra time while waiting for enough Applicants to complete the Initiative Application. Therefore we filter qualified applicants and sort by potential impact in the meantime. This avoids doing it all at once.

## Creation of Filtering & Sorting Post

When the position has been defined by the Working Group / Initiative, a post containing the filtering paramaters and sorting paramaters should be created within Slack. This will then be hyperlinked in the Assets Post where we keep our references to each mentee position.
## Filtering Procedure

1. The MI defines the filtering criteria for the current Position. These criteria assertain that the candidates are qualified for the position on the most basic level. Their skills that will be of benefit to the working group or initiative are not being judged. These critera are then posted in the MI's Assets Note in Slack to be referenced during each round of filtering.

>NOTE: `Filtering` differs from `Sorting`. `Filtering` determines if the applicants are qualified for the position, `Sorting` determines which applicant is best suited for the position.

2. The current Applicants are split evenly among the present MI members. Each member is assigned a color and the rows on the Applicant results spreadsheet are highlighted those colors.
3. Each member checks the assigned Applicants against the filtering criteria. Any that do not meet the criteria are removed from the spreadsheet.
4. Once all current Applicants have been filtered, all rows are re-highlighted to a non-white color to indicate that they have already been verified for eligibility so that they do not get rechecked in a later filtering round.

## Notes
* Is it worth the time to track ineligible Applicants rather than removing them from the spreadsheet and let them know why they were ineligible?

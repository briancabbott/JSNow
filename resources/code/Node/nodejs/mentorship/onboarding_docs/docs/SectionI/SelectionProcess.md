# Step 7: Sorting Process (Week 7)

## Motivation

With the window for applications closed and the filtering of applicants completed, it is time to sort the most suitable Mentee(s) from the applicant pool.

## Sorting Procedure

1. The MI will once again define critera to select applicants. However, this time the critera will be  based on how effective the applicant's skills will be for the working group / initiative. This procedure accounts for other skills that were not specified within our challenge but appeared in the candidate's application. This criteria should then be written down in the Filtering & Sorting Post for record keeping and reference.

>*Note*: Selection of sorting criteria will be different for every mentee position that is posted. Therefore, it is important to receive attributes and skills that would be beneficial to the working group / initiative when the MI discusses a new mentee position with them.

2. Each MI member will proceed to evaluate the filtered Candidates based on the Working Group or Initiative's sorting criteria and choose a favorite Candidate.

3. Once all present members have selected a favorite Candidate, a message in the MI Channel is created with the format “<Mentor’s Initiative Name> Selection”.

4. Here the MI members will post the applicant they believe is the best fit for the position.

5. Based on the MI member responses, a list of the top three applicants will be created. This list will sort the favorite candidates by rank in which we reccommend most given the specific sorting criteria.

6. Once the list has been created, we will send in the top three applicants as a recommendation to the working group / initiative for them to look over and decide.

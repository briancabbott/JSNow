## Minutes

### (backport 7.x) lib: deprecate node --debug at runtime [node#11275](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/11275) (@joshgav)

Do we land this semver-major change in next 7.x release?
A: Yes.
Does it make a difference if we use V8 5.7 in Node@8?
A: No.

@Fishrock123: A deprecation within a semver-major line has happened in the past
with Buffer.

Do we have an alternative to `node debug`? Yes, included in 7.6.0.
Should we mention that in warning text? No, should be part of `node debug`
deprecation, which is separate (see [node#11441](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/11441)).

Both `node --debug` and `node debug` will go away in the runtime at the same
time. So should we deprecate both at the same time?

Should we alias `--debug` to `--inspect`?
A: No.
Should we alias `node debug` to `node inspect`?
A: Maybe. Continue discussion in [node#11441](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/11441).

**Next steps:**

* Land `--debug` deprecation in 7.x as proposed.
* Continue discussion re `node debug`.

### tracking issue: async loader for module interop [node#11233](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/11233) (@trott)

@bmeck at work on implementation, still private due to many issues. Will share
privately in another week or so.

Ability to load from URLs introduces significant changes, such as impact of
special URL characters.

Issue in `require` which can cause loader to bring in files from parent
packages, should it be fixed in `require` and/or new loader?

@bnoordhuis: Like https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/4595?

Best not to change existing loader, but perhaps should be fixed in new loader.

---

### fs: runtime deprecation for fs.SyncWriteStream [node#10467](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/10467) (@jasnell)

No updates, remove label.

---

### Updating the Copyright [TSC#174](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/174)

No updates.

---

## Q&A, Other

@williamkapke: Some customers are relying on `require` falling through to parent
modules to access some files.

## Minutes

### ES Modules [node-eps#39](https://github.com/nodejs/node-eps/pull/39)

See
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xZILfv5WeUBKyQ9s1w8zArNgzTMGRFQXyRseSskjcjw>

Does Node.js want to ship a synchronous or asynchronous module loader? That is,
should `require` return a Promise or an Object, i.e. a module namespace object?

Temporal Dead Zone when returning module namespace object for an ES module; when
returning a Promise a TDZ exists but is past by the time the Promise is
fulfilled. But this isn’t how Babel does it.

@bmeck looking for specific direction from CTC, asked for vote.

@jasnell: should be a clear separation between require/CJS and import/ESM,
perhaps support async for import but not require.

@mylesborins: modules written for web will expect an async loader, and would be
best for Node.js to match browser behavior as much as possible.

@bmeck: browsers will move more and more to async loading.

@addaleax: having an async loader matches expected behavior in other places,
like top-level `await`.

@bmeck: synchronous loader and top-level `await` are mutually exclusive, can’t
do both.

@ofrobots: if we go async in Node we will disturb ecosystem which expects all to
be sync. Yet if we go sync we will lose compat with browsers and web.

@bmeck: browsers don’t have the option to ship an async loader.

@addaleax: an async loader wouldn’t effect CJS modules so concerns can be
addressed as authors move to ES modules. So wouldn’t be so disruptive.

@Fishrock123: Getting opinions from trainers of new users if this will make
learning curve steeper. Would be best if `require` is only sync. Async loader
could handle circular deps better, so that’s good.

Suggest using require for CJS and import for ES.

@Trott: We're voting on an EP not landing an implementation, which means that we
can change course later if necessary.

Are we debating changing `require` or just `import`?

`import(‘es’)` will always return a Promise, `require(‘cjs’)` will always return
an object. Question is `require(‘es’)` and `import(‘cjs’)`.

@jasnell: supporting both async and sync will be difficult.

@evanlucas: biggest concern is breaking ecosystem in order to support future
browsers.

@bmeck: but we’re breaking them anyway cause we can’t support named imports
(which break Babel transpilation of ES).

How will a sync loader affect future module usage and development in JS/TC39?
* Would disallow top-level await.
* Circular dependencies with asynchronously loaded ES modules.

Q: Why does Node.js want to have synchronous imports?
A: So that you can require an ES module and have it behave in the same way as a
CJS module.

@jasnell called for a vote next week, @Fishrock123 seconded.

**Next steps**

* Vote by next week.

### assert: enforce type check in deepStrictEqual [node#10282](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/10282)

@Trott: Suggest allowing internal changes as long as they don’t change API
surface.

@Fishrock123: Current policy is not to change unless needed by core.

Should we unlock `assert` for API changes?

Perhaps not, but we should still support new ES constructs within existing API.

@mylesborins will open an issue to re-evaluate what “locked” policy means,
becuase JS language changes happen more frequently now.

**Next steps** 

* @Trott to draft proposal based on this discussion as PR
  (see [node#11113](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/11113)).

---

### deps: Add node-inspect [node#10187](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/10187)

* Land node-inspect in deps?
* Integrate as `node inspect` or `node debug`.

If we leave in deps and vendor out we could integrate more directly in the
future. In the meantime, this is a good experiment for vendoring out modules.

---

### lib: be robust when process global is clobbered [node#10135](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/10135)

PR has not yet been updated to remove non-writable aspect.

### http: support environment-defined proxy [node#8381](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/8381)

Nothing new.

### Symbol key props visible in inspection by default [node#9726](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/9726)

3 CTC members are reviewing.

## Q/A on public channels

Q: How to get more people involved in ES module discussion?
A: Comment on the [node-eps#39](https://github.com/nodejs/node-eps/pull/39)
issue.

## Minutes

### buffer: discuss future direction of Buffer constructor API [node#9531](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/9531)

@Trott:

1. When (if?) should we schedule a runtime deprecation for `new Buffer()`?
2. Should that regular deprecation be preceded with a "Pending Deprecation" hidden behind a `--pending-deprecation` flag?
3. Should we implement a buffer filling mechansim, and if so zero or a random pattern?
  * Why random-fill? So that people wouldn’t realize buffers were being zero-filled and rely on that behavior.
  * @trevnorris: random filling doesn’t fit pattern of UInt8Array.

* PR for --pending-deprecation flag: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/11968
* PR for fill mechanism: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/11808

@rvagg: Can we deprecate just one signature of the constructor, i.e. the one that takes an int?

@trevnorris: Once we bump a minor version, we don’t support previous minor versions, so why are we concerned with those using older minors?

@bnoordhuis: Those who depend on releases from Linux distros don’t get minor updates for a while.

@mylesborins: That’s true of any security patches, if you use unpatched earlier versions you don’t have the patch…

@ChALkeR: Later modules may come to rely on zero-filled buffers, and those modules may be used with out-of-date earlier versions.

@rvagg: This is a massive ship to be turning, we should opt for greater patience, encourage people through docs and other channels.

@jasnell: This is one of the reasons for --pending-deprecation. Also other tools and linters are warning more.

@ChALkeR: I would support optin deprecation for now and a plan for later actual deprecation.

@jasnell: If we will land with filling it should be decided before 8.0 RCs (Apr-4).

@rvagg: May not be semver-major, especially if random-fill.

**Next steps**

* Continue discussion within GitHub issues.

### module: add support for abi stable module API [node#11975](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/11975)

Export an API and ABI stable C and C++ interface for native module developers.

@arunesh: Experimental, guarded by runtime flag. Goal is more feedback from community and module authors. V8 APIs used in 5+ of top 30 native modules are covered by a N-API equivalent.

@jasnell: Goal is to get into 8.0.0 as experimental.

@trevnorris: Converting a lot to void\*, how does it ensure the safety of what’s being passed?

@digitialinfinity: Type checking is done within implementation.

@jasnell: Does anyone object to this going into 8.0.0?

@bnoordhuis: Pretty big PR, will be hard to review by Apr-4.

@jasnell: Can we set a target for a week before final 8.0.0 release? It’s not semver-major.

@rvagg: Can NAN be backed by this API?  @digitalinfinity: C++ header-only wrapper is similar to NAN. Some discussion of considering that NAN 3.0. Haven’t considered backing NAN, worth considering. Hope to provide tools to aid migration after some adoption and feedback.

**Next steps**

* Review PR and provide feedback.

### async\_hooks initial implementation [#11883](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/11883)

@trevnorris: rewrote more cleanly, would like more feedback. Tried to be as least invasive as possible. Comes with a whole bunch of tests.

There are even async\_hooks in the async\_hooks tests to check for stuck previous tasks.

Touches many places in Node, hence want a lot of review.

@mylesborins: thoughts about using PromiseHooks from V8? @trevnorris: won’t be in V8 in 8.0.0, but as soon as it is I’ll integrate.

@joshgav: PromiseHooks is in V8 5.7 which will land in master shortly, see [node#11752](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/11752).

@rvagg: not a semver-major, and anyway still experimental, but still would be nice to have in 8.

@trevnorris: need to add docs, move around some tests.

**Next steps**

* Review PR and provide feedback.

## Minutes

### Remove Legacy Debugger for 8.0.0 [ctc#94](https://github.com/nodejs/CTC/issues/94)

master is on V8 5.7, 5.8 will be promoted to stable right before 8.0.0 release. 5.8 doesn't contain code for legacy debugger. In order to be able to migrate to 5.8 in 8.0.0 lifetime we have to remove support for the old interface now, at beginning of 8.

Even if we start 8.0.0 with 5.7, the Diag WG recommended that we hide the interface by aliasing --debug to --inspect or removing it.

node-inspect CLI debugger has landed in core, invoked via `node inspect script.js`.

Do we need to consider node-inspector? A: No, it's been deprecated per the README (https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector).

Some objection because we didn't go through a full deprecation cycle for the Debugger API. Perhaps different because this isn't a Node API. But unless we remove now we'll have to support through entire 8 lifetime.

Based on circumstances, no objections to moving forward with removing the old debugger. Keep listening for feedback from community.

**Next steps**

* Continue with PRs.

### async\_hooks PR [node#11883](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/11883)

Need more review, hoping to land in an early point release in 8.x.

Review to check for:
1. No regressions.
2. API works correctly.

## Q&A, Other

* Q: How can I contribute to Node.js source as a front-end developer? A: Check out nodetodo.org, and participate in Code-and-Learns in Oakland, Ireland, China, and Vancouver, Canada.

## Minutes

### Updating the Copyright [TSC#174](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/174)

Discussed in Legal Committee meeting this week which James attended.

Board will review in next meeting (Feb 13). Will first review reversion to
original headers, then the update James proposed with more concise language.

First PR [node#10155](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/10155) is ready to
land.
Second PR [node#10599](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/10599) needs some
updates: 1) add general linting rule to check for valid headers; 2) add docs
about how to add correct headers for the future.

@MylesBorins: Some files are licensed with WTFPL in npm and eslint.

@rvagg: See also
https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/tools/license-builder.sh.

James will audit all files and take needed action.

**Next steps:**

* James to continue work on
  [node#10599](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/10599).
* Keep on agenda for next week to review Board’s action.

### ES Modules: Module Loader [node-eps#39](https://github.com/nodejs/node-eps/pull/39)

Async or sync for `require()`? Support mixed ES and CJS trees in `require()`?

@MylesBorins has talked with many in Google and other stakeholders, sentiment is
that some compromise must be made, and best to keep difference between Node.js
and browsers as small as possible. So `import` keyword should be asynchronous. 

In V8 loader, path resolution of modules is asynchronous, but evaluation of
modules is deterministic and same as synchronous `require()`.

Could still have a synchronous loader through another function, e.g. some
evolution of `require(...)`.

@jasnell: Cannot synchronously `require(‘esm’)`, and probably cannot
asynchronously `import cjs`.

@mylesborins: `import` keyword must be top of file, `import()` function can be
used later. `import()` function can be treated as synchronous by `await
import()`.

@Fishrock123: still problematic for deps tree that includes ES and CJS modules
[Editor: because of Temporal Dead Zone].

@jasnell: and even more complex if there are circular deps.

@jasnell: Easiest thing to do is use asynchronous `import/import()` for ES and
synchronous `require` for CJS.

Next step should be to begin implementation and adjust if needed.

@Fishrock123: If we want a sync loader we need a second type of ModuleRecord (in
ECMA-262) to avoid the Temporal Dead Zone between parse and eval time for ES
modules.

@rvagg: We need to guard Node’s interests even if they’re not the same as
browsers. But in this case not necessarily in Node’s interest to go sync.

@mylesborins: Many JS developers work in both browser and non-browser
environments, and compatibility between them is one of the reasons for the
success of Node.

@evanlucas: you can’t exactly jump between them now, e.g. `fs` is only in Node.

@jasnell: We try to differ only when we have to, like `fs`. If it’s reasonable
to match browsers with an async loader we should do that.

Those who have opinions on CTC and @bmeck are leaning toward async.

Begin implementation and learn and adjust as needed. Begin with async since if
successful it brings us closer to browsers; if unsuccessful fall back to the
easier path with a sync loader.

@mylesborins suggested a meeting with CTC and TC39 in May:
[CTC#67](https://github.com/nodejs/CTC/issues/67).

@Trott will open [an issue][node#11233] specifically to track implementation of an async
module loader and keep that on ctc-agenda.

[node#11233]: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/11233

**Next steps:**

* Begin implementation of an async loader and learn and adjust as needed.
* @Trott will open an issue to track.

## Q&A, Other

@jasnell will cut 8.x branch in second week of March, so any semver-majors
should be landed by early March.

@jasnell opened a new PR to add actual deprecation codes.

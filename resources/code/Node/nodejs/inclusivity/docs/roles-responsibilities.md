# Roles and Responsibilities
This document outlines the major roles and responsibilities associated with the inclusivity working group.

## Roles
The inclusivity working group has two main roles for participants, Member and Contributor.

### Member
Members are the core group of people responsible for the inclusivity working group. Members make a regular commitment to participating in the working group and contributing to deliverables. The target size for membership is 6-12 people.

The current list of members can be found [here](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity#initial-membership).

#### Responsibilities
Members are expected to contribute in some way every two weeks because the group delivers on a biweekly basis.

A member's time commitment can be spent on a variety of contributions including, but not limited to:

- Preparing and participating in working group meetings. See [issue #64](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/issues/64) for discussion around the roles and responsibilities for meetings.
- Participation in the working group Slack channel.
- Developing new policies, documentation, etc. for the group (e.g. [add CONTRIBUTING.md content](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/pull/88)).
- Developing resources for the wider node community (e.g. [Getting Started in Node.js Program](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/issues/96)).
- Reviewing [pull requests](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/pulls) on the inclusivity repository.
- Moderating [issues](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/issues) on the inclusivity repository.
- Enforcement of the working group's [code of conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Assisting with moderation outside the inclusivity repository, when the group is asked for help.
- Responding to emails and other outside requests sent to the inclusivity working group.
- Participating in discussions on the private and/or public working group slack channels.
- Outreach with other communities.
- Operations (e.g. managing membership for slack, github).
- Reviewing, voting on, and responding to membership requests.

If a member will be unavailable to meet these responsibilities, they are expected to notify the group in a timely manner, so resources can be planned accordingly. A member who cannot maintain these responsibilities for a significant amount of time will be asked to transition to a contributor role.

As representatives of the working group, members are expected to set an example with the [code of conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Violations of the code of conduct may lead to loss of member status and/or removal from the working group.

#### Permissions

Members have the following level of access and permissions for the working group.

- Are allowed to speak on behalf of the group in outreach, emails, etc.
- Have access to member-only, private slack channel.
- Receive emails sent to the working group's email ([inclusivity@nodejs.org](mailto:inclusivity@nodejs.org)).
- Github:
    - Content: view, edit.
    - Issues: view, create, comment, edit, close.
    - Pull requests: create, comment, merge, close.
    - Moderation of issues, pull requests, etc.
- Has priority for participation in working group meetings (because there are limited slots available in google hangouts).

### Contributors
Contributors are people who contribute to the inclusivity working group, but do not have specific responsibilities and commitments.

Anyone can be a contributor, and there is no admissions process for becoming a contributor. Review the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating to familiarize yourself with expected behavior when contributing to the working group.

#### Responsibilities

Contributors do not have any specific time or deliverable commitments. They may contribute to the working group as much or as little as they like.

Contributor contributions may include, but are not limited to:

- Making pull requests on the inclusivity repository.
- Contribution to discussions on issues and pull requests in the inclusivity repository.
- Participating in discussions on the public working group slack channel (to be created in the near future).

Contributor are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Violations of the code of conduct may lead to removal from the working group.

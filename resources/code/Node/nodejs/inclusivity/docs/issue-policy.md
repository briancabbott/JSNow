# Filing Issues

The Inclusivity Working Group exists to increase inclusivity and diversity within the Node.js project. Discussions within this Working Group often touch on a wide range of topics which makes it easy for discussions to stray off-topic. The following requirements exist for filing issues to help make sure discussions stay on topic.

We understand that our issue policy is probably more perscriptive than you're used to, and we want to help! Please feel free to file an issue in whatever format you would like, and ask for help getting it structured to the meet the guidelines below. We'll help you through the process.

## Requirements

- Issues should be filed with the intent to further the mission of this Working Group
    - Issues in this repository are not the place for individual education about inclusivity/diversity, discussing whether this group should exist, etc.
- Issues should be filed for topics that are within the scope of this Working Group
    - For example, if you want to file an issue with project-wide scope, it should probably be filed under the [Technical Steering Comittee repository](https://github.com/nodejs/tsc). Issues should only be filed that request changes at the TSC level here if it is an inclusivity/diversity related topic _and_ members of this Working Group are needed to spearhead the initiative.
- Issues should not be filed for topics that have already been decided
    - Not everyone will agree with everything that has been decided by this group, this is expected.
    - Issues that are filed in an attempt to reopen a discussion that has already been decided will be closed immediately without discussion.
    - Other moderation actions may be taken if the issue filed violates the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
    - As a reminder, all discussions will be open for at [least one week](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/#communication-policy). This window is the appropriate time to express criticism and disagreement, not after.
    - If there is substantial new information or a change in circumstances, then it's ok to file a new issue.

## Structure

Each issue should have the following information.

### Purpose

The purpose should be a brief description of what you would like to see addressed. The type of issue should be explicitly mentioned in the purpose:

- _Question_ A question about any of the policies, programs, processes, etc of this Working Group. Some of the policies and recommendations of this group may not be clear, and a question asks for clarification. The resolution to a question should be an answer in the issue, not a change to policy or documentation.
- _Request for changes to a policy_ A request for change is used to clarify an existing policy. Issues of this type are typically of the form "This document is unclear in the case of x. Can we modify it to be more explicit?" or "The document says x, but I think it would be more effective if we did y instead".
- _Request for new policy_ This Working Group's equivalent of a feature request, a request to create new policies.

In some cases, a question may lead to a request for changes to a policy or request for new policy. In this case, issue authors may either file a new issue or rewrite the original issue to match the format for the new issue, at their discretion.

### Proposal

This optional section only applies to policy issues.

If you have an idea of what the policy should look like, include a summary of it here. This does not need to be a fully formed version of the policy, just an overview of what you think it should look like. If you have a more fully formed proposal, please submit it as a pull request.

### Focus

This section defines what is "on topic" and what is "off topic." The discussions in this group touch on a broad range of topics, and it's very easy to get off topic no matter how well-intentioned everyone is. By having an explicit definition of what is considered on topic and off topic, and what the issue author hopes to get out of the discussion, we should be able to focus better.

```
## Purpose

I looked through the inclusivity docs, specifically the
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
and it's unclear to me if hot dogs are considered sandwiches or not. So my
question is: does the Code of Conduct consider hot dogs to be sandwiches? The
wording around this topic is unclear to me.

## Focus

This discussion is specifically about the classification of hot dogs in the
realm of sandwiches. Discussions that don't consider both hot dogs and
sandwiches should be considered off topic.

Some off topic examples include, but are not limited to:
- What other foods are classified as sandwiches?
- Are hot dogs classified as snacks or meals?
- Are hot dogs considered to be an American invention, or are they also
  considered of German origin?
```

```
## Purpose

The "Friendly Harassment-Free Space" section of the
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
is ambiguous when it comes to whether hot dogs are considered sandwiches or not.
I think we should modify the language to clarify the position of the Inclusivity
Working Group.

## Focus

This discussion is specifically about modifying the Code of Conduct to clarify
the classification of hot dogs in the realm of sandwiches. Discussions that
don't consider both hot dogs, sandwiches, and the Code of Conduct should be
considered off topic.

Some off topic examples include, but are not limited to:
- What other foods are classified as sandwiches?
- Are hot dogs classified as snacks or meals?
- Are hot dogs considered to be an American invention, or are they also
  considered of German origin?
- The validity of other sections of the Code of Conduct
- The usefulness or necessity of Codes of Conduct in general
```

```
## Purpose

I think that the
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
should have a new section added to it. This section should talk about the
Working Group's official position on whether hot dogs are considered sandwiches
or not.

## Proposal

I think the new section should be titled "Hot dogs are sandwiches too" and should
go over the following points:
- Inclusivity is in the name of this Working Group, and so strives to be
  inclusive in its definitions
- Any comprehensive definition of a sandwich that excludes hot dogs would also
  require excluding other non-normative sandwiches, which most people consider
  to be sandwiches

## Focus

Some off topic examples include, but are not limited to:
- What other foods are classified as sandwiches?
- Are hot dogs classified as snacks or meals?
- Are hot dogs considered to be an American invention, or are they also
  considered of German origin?
- The validity of other sections of the Code of Conduct
- The usefulness or necessity of Codes of Conduct in general
```

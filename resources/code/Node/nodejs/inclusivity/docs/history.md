# History of the Inclusivity Working Group

The Inclusivity Working Group was formed on 13 June 2015, at
[NodeConf Adventure](http://nodeconf.com/) and
[ratified by the TSC](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/pull/29#issuecomment-171771185) on 14 January 2016.

## Founding

NodeConf Adventure is "a conference in the woods for Node.js developers" that
is held every year at Walker Creek Ranch in the hills north of San Francisco.
This event is an "unconference," meaning that there is no set schedule or
speakers. Discussions are decided on and planned the day of, allowing them to
build on previous discussions.

At the 2015 event, there was a discussion on the first day about hostile
culture in open source and Node.js. This first discussion was unfocused and
and kept getting derailed, with the topic and purpose of the discussion being
largely ignored.

A few of us had some private discussions later and decided to try scheduling a
diversity session again. This time, however, we were determined to make it
productive. Fortunately, one of the other attendees at the conference, Jacob
Groundwater, had gone through facilitation training. We tapped Jacob to
facilitate two diversity sessions on the second day of the conference.

These two sessions proved to be extremely productive, thanks in large part to
Jacob's facilitation strategies. In these sessions, we shared often
heart-breaking stories of marginalization and strife within the Node.js and
broader tech community. We then identified what we felt were the key issues
preventing people from contributing to Node.js. We finished by discussing what
sort of values we want the Node.js community to have.

At the end of the second session, we decided that this work should continue,
and that the best way was to form a Node.js Working Group. So, C J Silverio
created a Slack team, and invited everyone who was at these two sessions to
join.

And thus the Node.js Inclusivity Working Group was founded.

## Revival

Sadly the momentum generated at NodeConf didn't last. There was some initial
work on getting the group up and running, but that work pretty much stopped
for a variety of reasons.

The group lay dormant for several months until one fateful day in early November
2015 when Myles Borins filed issue [#3721](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/3721)
(content warning: discussions of suicide). This thread refocused the
conversation back to inclusivity after having been dormant for some time.

The discussion of this issue, on GitHub, Twitter, and elsewhere attracted the
attention of several new members. The new members and remaining initial
members were able to get the group started again.

This time the momentum stuck, culminating in the Inclusivity Working Group
getting ratified by the TSC on 14 January 2016.

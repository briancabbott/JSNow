# Contributing

:sparkles: Hi! :sparkles: Welcome to the Node Inclusivity Working
Group. We're excited that you'd like to contribute :)

## First Steps

1. __Read our [charter]__
  
  Think of it like a statement of purpose. Our charter gives a 
  top-level view of what we'd like to accomplish with this WG.

2. __Read the latest [meeting notes]__
  
  Every 2 weeks, the WG members get together to discuss current
  issues and PRs, goals, and other related news. This is a great
  way to figure out what's happening at the moment.

3. __Read our docs__
  
  We have an interesting history, some rules around filing issues,
  and other ideas. You can find all this info in the
  [`/docs` directory].

## Getting Involved

This WG focuses on 2 types of deliverables:

- Policies
- Programs

### Policies

Policies that we have created live in the [`/policies` directory].
We also consider our [Code of Conduct] a policy :)

If you wish to file an issue to change a policy for this WG, change
a policy in Node.js generally, or propose a new policy, please read
this [document][1].

### Programs

Programs that we run and support are documented in 
[`/programs` directory].

You can check out proposed programs using the [`program` label].

We are currently working on documentation for the process of proposing
programs. For more information see [issue/91].

## Discussions

We try to keep as much discussion as possible in public to maximize
transparency and community participation. Most of our discussions occur
in [Slack] or [GitHub issues]. Participating in Slack discussions
requires joining the node-inclusivity Slack team. To do so, please use
the [Node.js Inclusivity Slack Inviter].

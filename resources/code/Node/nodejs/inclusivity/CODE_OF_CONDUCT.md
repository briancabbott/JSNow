# Code of Conduct
> This CoC is an adaptation of the [npm Code of Conduct].

The Node.js Inclusivity Working Group exists to improve inclusivity
and diversity in the Node.js project and surrounding community.

We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is
friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment.

Towards this end, certain behaviors and practices will not be
tolerated.

## tl;dr

* Be respectful.
* Abusive behavior is never tolerated.
* Violations of this code may result in swift and permanent expulsion
  from the Node.js inclusivity working group and/or escalation to the
  Node.js moderation group and TSC

## Scope

This policy covers behavior within the context of the Node.js
Inclusivity Working Group. It is expected that all Working Group members,
Node.js community members, and commenters participating in Inclusivity
Working Group affairs abide by this Code of Conduct at all times in all
public or private venues.

The definitions of various subjective terms such as "discriminatory",
"hateful", or "confusing" will be decided at the sole discretion of
the Node.js Inclusivity Working Group team members.

Working Group members have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they
deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, Working Group members commit themselves
to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of
managing this project. Working Group members who do not follow or enforce
the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the Working Group.

## Friendly Harassment-Free Space

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
environment for all, regardless of gender identity, sexual
orientation, ability, ethnicity, religion or lack thereof, age, physical
appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.

Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing
behavior is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.

Harassing other Working Group participants is never tolerated, whether
via public or private media.

Avoid using offensive or harassing names, nicknames, or other
identifiers that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming
environment for all.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: harmful or prejudicial
verbal or written comments related to gender identity, sexual
orientation, ability, ethnicity, religion or lack thereof, age, physical
appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics;
inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, and/or sexually explicit
language in public spaces; threats of physical or non-physical harm;
deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography
or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events;
inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

## Reporting Violations of this Code of Conduct

If you believe someone is harassing you or has otherwise violated this
Code of Conduct, please contact us at inclusivity@nodejs.org to send
us an abuse report.  If this is the initial report of a problem, please
include as much detail as possible. The more context we have, the better
we can assess and resolve the situation.

## Consequences

All participation in this Working Group is at the sole discretion of
the Working Group members.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply
immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the Working
Group members may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and
including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community
without warning.

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating
this Code of Conduct, you should notify the Working Group by emailing
us at inclusivity@nodejs.org.  We will do our best to ensure that
your grievance is handled appropriately.

In general, we will choose the course of action that we judge as being
most in the interest of fostering a safe and friendly community.

## Contact Info

Please contact inclusivity@nodejs.org if you need to report a problem or
address a grievance related to an abuse report.

You are also encouraged to contact us if you are unsure if something
is appropriate or inappropriate.  We are happy to provide guidance
to help you be a successful part of our community.

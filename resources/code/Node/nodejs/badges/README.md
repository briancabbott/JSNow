# Badges Initiative

This is the organizational repository for the Node.js Badges Strategic Initiative, as chartered under the [Community Committee].

This initiative is tasked with facilitating the design, development and production of Node.js Badges, committee and working group logos, and all associated merchandise and paraphernalia required to further encourage contribution and community engagement.

These responsibilities include, but are not limited to:
 - Management of the Node.js [Open Badges Account];
 - The new badge approval and release process;
 - Asset creation and style guide standards;
 - Badge award processes;
 - Development and Maintenance of badge issuance automation tooling;
 - Development and Maintenance of badge creation tooling;
 - Production and distribution of stickers, pins, and related products created from content that emerges from this initiative.

## Why

Badges serve as visual tokens of achievement and affiliation, and are an amazing way to cultivate community and encourage contribution in the Node.js project. The Badges Team exists to create and maintain official Node.js badges, and provide the specification and tools for community members to create their own. By enabling a variety of Node.js community awards and social recognition, we expect to see increased community engagement as members discover new ways to fly their Node.js flag high!

## How

The Badges team manages a collection of Node.js Badge assets, associated award criteria, and the Badge design specification, in this repository. New badges managed under Community Committee should be added to this repository by following the Badges RFC Process.

> TODO: Outline the Badges RFC Process

Badges that are PR'd in through the RFC process are then added to the Node.js [Open Badges Account]. [Open Badges] is an open source awards specification where issuers may award and track verifiable, portable, digital badges which contain embedded metadata about achievements. By leveraging [Open Badges] as our awards system we are able to make use of an existing infrastructure to deliver and showcase these community achievements.

The Node.js organization uses [Badgr][Open Badges Account] as its [Open Badges] issuer platform. Badgr's free and open source service, ability to add multiple account owners, and robust API make it an ideal platform for Node.js.

Badgr's API enables this team to automate the award of many official Node.js badges.

Once a community member has been awarded a badge, they are invited to openly share their digital award across the internet! However, as we all know, developers love their community schwag. All Node.js badges will also be available in the community store for purchase as stickers, pins, and other forms of merchandise.

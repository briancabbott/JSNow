# Social Media Style Guide - Node.js
## A guide for publishing under the Node.js brand.

> ###### Note:
> **Key points** of every section **are highlighted in bold** for quick scanning.

### Core Guideline
Be positive wherever and whenever possible.
  * **Engage with the community** in a friendly and outgoing way. Help those who are learning, aid those who know, and support those who teach. Repost or comment when people succeed with Node.js. Join a discussion on Node.js and contribute your thoughts and opinions on the topic. Stay positive.
  * Always **be nice** when speaking about people, projects, or companies. We're here to **help the JavaScript community** in adopting and supporting Node.js. **Speaking negatively** about someone or something in the community **does not help us achieve that goal**. No matter what people say, we encourage open discussion of Node.js, its community, and its issues.
  * If someone is directly negative toward Node.js, adopt the attitude of "**kill 'em with kindness**." Be friendly, responsive, and honest - take what they say, understand it, and respond appropriately and kindly. People are entitled to their opinions about Node.js, its community, its contributors, and so on. There is always a way to **turn negative thoughts into positive ones** to aid the adoption and growth of Node.js (or any other platform, service, company, etc., for that matter).


### Posting, Commenting, Reposting, Liking, and Linking
#### Posting
**Post relevant information**. It's up to you to decide what's relevant. There are a wide variety of things that could be important to members or groups within the Node.js community. If you think it would be interesting, useful, or fun for someone in the community, post it.

#### Commenting and Reposting
Comment and/or repost when you can if you see...
  * **A question**, directly or indirectly, about Node.js that you know the answer to. If you don't know the answer, but know there is a channel the poster can find the answer in (such as IRC, Twitter, mailing lists, TC/WG meetings, etc.), try to direct the poster through your comment to that cannel, or make people that participate in it aware with your repost.
  * **Someone achieve something**, no matter how big or small. Respond with encouragement and congratulations.
  * **An event in the community**. Try to spread the word about Node.js events, meetups, and communities as much as possible.

#### Liking/Favoriting
Like/favorite positive or **interesting posts** that are about Node.js, but which you **don't feel a need to comment on or repost**.

#### Important: Mention, Link to, and Write About Relevant People, Projects, and Organizations Whenever Possible.
People are very happy when they get official mentions, links, and comments. **Mention people, projects, or organizations directly**, such as through an `@mention` on Twitter, when they can be credited or recognized for something. Link to official repositories, pages, and sites when appropriate. Write posts to raise awareness of exemplary people, projects, and organizations when you have something positive to say about them.


### Language & Writing

> ###### Localization note:
> For those posting from localized Node.js social media accounts, find a standardized writing style for your language and apply that if the English conventions outlined here aren't considered normal or "best practices" when writing properly in your language. Apply the standardized writing style's conventions to the categories listed below, as well as others that may be important for your language.

#### Writing

##### Use Title Case for Titles and Headings
Title case is seen in every heading in this document. **Title case is where the first letter of every word in a given phrase** (in our case, titles of posts and headings inside a document) **is capitalized**. This excludes specific standard English words such as `a`, `to`, `the`, `an`, `at`, `are`, `of`, `by`, `for`, and so on, unless they are the first word in the title or section of a title (such as after a colon or dash). Some examples would be:

  * Today is a Good Day to Die
  * 42: The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything
  * The Squid: Death's Reawakening
  * Mogar is Ready - The Ultimate Guide to Fighting Bears

##### Use Full Sentences, with Capitalization and Punctuation
**Follow proper sentence structure**. For example, in English, write with a capital at the beginning of every sentence, and a period at the end. You don't have to be up-tight; proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation can be used with just about anybody's vocabulary. **This simply ensures the Node.js is seen as a professional endeavor**, run by mature human beings. This is extremely important to maintaining the best possible image of Node.js in the collective community mind.

##### Write Articles in Markdown, for Maintainability and Localization
Markdown has basically become a universal writing format on the web. When writing blog posts, articles, and other long form information that will be posted that will represent Node.js officially, please write the entire contents of the post in Markdown. We request this for two reasons.

One is that it gives a central file or location for a post to be stored, commented on, and edited by the Evangelism WG to ensure it represents Node.js to the best of its ability, following this styleguide. The other reason is that it allows for localization groups to

#### Language

##### Use Clear, Concise language
Write clearly and concisely. **Use words that clearly convey your meaning in order to eliminate potential confusion.** Outside of technical terms and messages, use common language to make content more universally understandable. This allows your message to reach the broadest audience possible.


##### Use the Active Voice
**Write** post titles, social media entries, and comments **in the active voice**. The active voice front-loads the _subject_ of the sentence, and **ensures the subject is the one taking action**, while the passive voice front-loads the object of the sentence, and the has action applied to the subject via the object. Here are some examples:

There are **several reasons** to write in the active voice **instead of the passive voice**:
  * The passive voice **is frequently awkward or vague**, which can leave the reader confused.
  * The passive voice **can be unnecessarily wordy**, making the meaning of your writing harder to understand.
  * When using the passive voice, it is **easy to accidentally leave out the subject** (the person/thing/entity) that is taking the action.

---

**Active**:
  * Node.js (*subject*) uses (*action*) a modern version of V8 (*object*).

**Passive**:
  * A modern version of V8 (*object*) is used by (*action*) Node.js (*subject*).

  ---

**Active**:
  * Some core contributors (*subject*) forked (*action*) Node.js (*object*), and named the fork (*secondary, compound action*) Node.js.

**Passive**:
  * Node.js (*object*) was forked (*action*) by some core contributors (*subject*); the fork is named (*secondary, compound action*) Node.js.

  ---

> ###### Note:
> This is a more complex example of the active voice. If your writing ends up like this, you should evaluate what you want to say, and decide if you need to write it in a more simple and concise way.

**Active**:
  * npm (*subject*), a stable of Node.js (*secondary, set off object*) development, gained support (*action*) for Node.js (*object*)  before version 1.0.0's public release (*tricky action-like; "minimally changed" is the action that has been actively done, compatibility was a result of that action*)

**Passive**:
  * Node.js (*object*) was able to be supported (*action*) by npm (*subject*), a stable of Node.js (*secondary object*) development, before version 1.0.0 of Node.js was publicly released (*tricky action-like; "minimally changed" is the action that has been actively done, compatibility was a result of that action*)

  ---

There are times that using the passive voice is a better fit, but it is good to **keep in mind that the active voice is usually the better choice**. Remembering that, the choice is ultimately yours.

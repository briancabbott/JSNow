## Structure/Format

Meetup organizers have found that two to three presenters give good balance to a meetup.
* 20-30 minute talks for each presenter is the sweet spot.
  * Presentations run the risk of becoming too lengthy, and may lose interest of the audience.
* You can specifically structure your event to a set number of speakers
  * two speakers might be beneficial to give both a basic and an advanced talk, catering to the
two groups.
* Over your first few events, try different formats (two 30 minutes, three 20 minutes, two 20 minutes and 20 minutes of Q&A, and so on) and see which ones you think work best.

As you start, solicit developers to come present at your meetup. You should
plan out speakers a few events out. You want to be sure that you have people
to speak at your event, and to be able to ensure speakers will have enough
notice to ensure you're on their schedules.

#### Protips:
* "We generally have one beginner type talk and a more advanced one. Structuring our events this way allows us to reach a wide audience and have something more in depth for those that have been in the ecosystem for a while.

* "Co-working spaces have been our go-to meetup venue hosts, but with attendance sometimes surpassing 100 people, it's a challenge to find a reliable, free venue." @danmactough on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145729309)
* "We try to put on themed nights such as IoT, performance, testing but this takes a LOT of work to approach speakers and maybe a bit beyond beginner." @iancrowther on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145829320)
* "We also run a segment called Community Announcements which is great as its very interactive with the audience. [...] Getting the audience on the mic makes networking super easy and ensures people know who to speak to and don't miss out. Everyone has had a few beers by then so its a lot of fun, some heckling and general mayhem. As a host, this is my favorite part of the event as I honestly have no ideas what's coming." @iancrowther on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145829320)


## RSVP
Using an online event/meetup planning site is the standard. [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) and
[ti.to](https://ti.to/) are two that are used at a few popular Node meetups. You can base
the number of RSVPs available on your venue's capacity.

**Food and drink** reserves are needed for the event. RSVPs are important for
measuring food and drink coverage, as they help you gauge how much you need.

**Attendance**  for a free meetup can be as low as 10% of the total RSVPs.
Charging a small fee will bring a higher level of commitment to attendance.
For free meetups with RSVP, you may want to cap the RSVP over the actual capacity
of your event.

#### Protips:
* "We base the number of RSVPs depending on the capacity of the space we're using for the month." @paulgrock on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145303436)
* "We use meetup.com to manage RSVPs so we can limit attendance to the venue capacity and plan food/beverage. We typically see ~50% of RSVPs actually attend." @danmactough on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145729309)
* "We do a few things here, we have provided block tickets to some code academies meaning they just have 10 tickets a month to distribute as they wish. Its keeps the door open to new attendees from new semesters etc. These targeted block ticket allocations allow us to shape the audience and keep it a mix of beginner through to advanced and allows us to be a very diverse crowd.. not just the developer stereotype." @iancrowther on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145829320)


## Sponsors
Sponsors can help cover costs of the event. Food and drink, venue, gear, and
management resources and costs can be covered by them. Sponsors can also help
provide content for your even. Having a talk given by one of their employees,
about their product, can be a benefit both to you and the sponsor.

Sponsors aren't always necessary, however. It takes a lot of extra work to 
communicate, set up, and maintain a relationship with them. A meetup can succeed
without them, you just need to manage and invest personal resources a bit more.

#### Protips:
* "[We have] no sponsors for our group. Though we do have a company around SF host the event which usually involves setting up places for guests to sit, providing food/drinks and A/V setup for the speakers." @paulgrock on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145303436)
* "We are continually experimenting with format. For a long time (before I was an organizer), the format was all lightning talks. Then we tried 2-3 20-minute talks. Both of those formats made it difficult to find enough presenters." @danmactough on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145729309)
* "For the past year, we (mostly @adunkman) have been soliciting proposals for talks and planning meetups out a calendar quarter at a time. These talks have all been long-format (40-minute) talks, and they've been really successful." @danmactough on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145729309)
* "Currently we offer a standard sponsor pack, paid in advance, invoiced from LNUG directly. We are in the process of establishing a tiered sponsorship plan so we can cater for companies of all sizes and take on some longer term partners." @iancrowther on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145829320)
* "It is extremely important for us to try and select local business over established brands and chain suppliers. For instance food is provided by a local cafe over subway (same price per head)." @iancrowther on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145829320)

## Preparation
Venue, food and drink supplies, venue setup (physical objects like signage,
chairs and tables, cleaning resources, and so on, as well as digital
presentation tools like projectors and a demo computer), and anything else that
comes up in planning needs to be taken care of before the event starts.

#### Protips:
* "For location we started out by hosting at locations that our organizers worked at or knew people who worked at that place. After a few months companies started reaching out to us to host. If we haven't had a company volunteer to host we can fallback to one of our organizers' locations. A lot of locations require a guest list for security purposes. Having a copy on hand is also good if the event is rigid about RSVPs and waitlists." @paulgrock on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145303436)
* "We try to get venues for 6 month blocks! We have a google calendar to try and be consistent with things that need to be done in preparation (with varying success!). You need hosting slides, to test the A/V, allow speakers to test before the event starts etc." @iancrowther on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145829320)
* "There are now 17 people who help organize LNUG and each one is delegated a task. Each delegated task has a todo guide, for example how to write the newsletter. These guides, outline what key info needs to be included, what services to use and when to ship. Each organiser completely owns their task and is responsible for it. Each task is meant to have a shadow owner in case the main owner is on holiday or sick. the guide is meant to make a handover simple. This helped to decentralize the org and we can painlessly absorb people coming and going." @iancrowther on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145829320)
* "We have x2 pizza runs. the first one is early and gets devoured! the second one means late comers don't miss out and everyone is supplied with a supply of warm pizza and cold beer! We get good feedback for this." @iancrowther on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145829320)
* "If you supply drinks etc, get them delivered! the additional cost is worth it as you have too much else going on and need to be onsite." @iancrowther on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145829320)
* "Make sure the address is on tickets, the website, the newsletter.. basically everywhere.. and be clear on how to cancel them." @iancrowther on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145829320)

## Code of Conduct (CoC)
CoCs are _very_ important at meetups. They ensure appropriate behavior is
maintained, and allow for enforcement when they are not followed correctly.

#### Protips:
* "Be prepared to enforce your Code of Conduct. We had one event about 1-1/2 years ago where the speaker, completely out of the blue, made a really inappropriate joke during his talk. Then another. And finally one more. Thankfully that was all because none of us were ready to step in, and we ended up letting it slide without saying a word. We really dropped the ball, and I will never let that happen again." @danmactough on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145729309)

## Other Protips
* "Something that has been really helpful for SFNode is having an organizing team of around 4. Having a small group of people allows organizers to not stress over missing an event if they are busy, traveling or anything else. It also makes it so one person isn't burdened with all of the organizational tasks. Having at least 2 organizers at each event is quite handy as well." @paulgrock on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145303436)
* "For the most part we've always had 2 speakers at our events. Once or twice we've had three people present but it's a bit of an aberration. The choice was made to go with 2 topics to keep the meetup short and not take up everyone's whole night." @paulgrock on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145303436)
* "We ask everyone to RSVP but aren't strict about checking at the door. Because 40-60% no show on their RSVP we tend to let most people that show up into the event." @paulgrock on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145303436)
* "Co-working spaces have been our go-to meetup venue hosts, but with attendance sometimes surpassing 100 people, it's a challenge to find a reliable, free venue. The company I work for, Social Tables, will be moving in December to new offices where we'll have event space. This will solve the venue problem for us." @danmactough on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145729309)
* "It's really helpful for your members to know when to expect your next meetup. We try to have our meetups on Thursdays (typically not the first Thursday of the month), and we try to have a formal meetup once a month. Sometimes we fail." @danmactough on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145729309)
* "The best thing we do as a meetup, though, IMO is our Node Nights (credit @joshfinnie). We plan these in between the formal-talk-style meetups (2 weeks in between), and sometimes host them in DC with NodeDC, and sometimes host in Arlington with Nova Node." @danmactough on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism/issues/162#issuecomment-145729309)
* "We always welcome people to give us feedback: we mostly use Github and we set up a repo to handle that part but also have an open email for all more private feedback (ex. if harassment happens?) and ofc. on sight organizers are always happy to help" @orliesaurus on [GitHub]()
* "We manage the speakers on GitHub so its super transparent and everyone knows who will be speaking next" @orliesaurus on [GitHub]()
* "We send out a newsletter every month a week or few days before the event with the talk titles, avatars, twitters(or simil) of speakers and links to our community github repo (feedback/request for new speakers)" @orliesaurus on [GitHub]()
* "We have a team of 10 people helping with the meetup and one or two "overseers" that have been in the community long enough to understand, appreciate and drive the meetup direction " @orliesaurus on [GitHub]()
* "We always ask for volunteers to help, anyone is welcome to join the "organisers-team"" @orliesaurus on [GitHub]()

# CoffeeScript Loader

This is a transpiler loader, using CoffeeScript as its example. It currently works for all-ESM graphs; an app that contains a mix of ES modules and CommonJS does not yet work. `npm test` currently fails.

To see the ESM-only version in action, run:

```shell
npm install
npm run esm-only
```

## Present

* Wesley Todd (@wesleytodd)
* Geoff Goodman (@ggoodman)

## Agenda

* Import maps
* `initialize` returning hooks
* External format support

## Notes

* Import maps: Wes will refactor his branch to move the import maps resolution within `defaultResolve`, integrate with the policy mapping and integration tests. Might move into a separate function in a chain as a later improvement.

* `initialize` returning hooks: Geoff will comment on the thread with the specific use case that this solves, probably along the lines of what @giltayar was mentioning. The initial use case discussed, of registering the same hooks multiple times and getting new state for each time, can already trivially be solved by registering with a query param like `register(‘./hooks.mjs?q=1’)`. But we assume there are other use cases where creating the hooks from `initialize` might be beneficial.

* External format support: Jacob will start a new PR with just the docs additions: the new top-level section with instructions for end users and package authors on how to use and create packages that can be used with Node for their customization hooks. Next few steps:
  * Land this PR that defines what the process looks like if done manually.
  * Update the error message for unsupported file types to reference this docs page.
  * Create a script like `npm init @nodejs/add-typescript` or whatever that automates the steps in the doc via an interactive wizard along the lines of `npm init`.

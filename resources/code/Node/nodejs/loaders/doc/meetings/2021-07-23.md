## Agenda

* esm: consolidate ESM Loader methods [#37468](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/37468)

TODO: Move the loaders examples repo into the nodejs org.

## Notes

Jacob is getting the example loaders in https://github.com/GeoffreyBooth/node-loaders/pull/2 to work. One of the tests in there was failing, for returning `format: 'commonjs'`; but that test fails in current Node, not just in the new PR, so that’s a known issue. Jacob will add a comment to that test so we don’t stumble across it in the future. Once he finishes updating the example loaders, we’ll merge in his updates and copy the new examples into the docs examples in the nodejs PR. Then that PR should get final code review and should be able to merge in.

### nodejs/node

* esm: consolidate ESM Loader methods [#37468](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/37468)

Jacob’s PR is nearing completion. Geoffrey had suggested previously that Jacob get the CoffeeScript and HTTPS examples in https://github.com/GeoffreyBooth/node-loaders working against the build of Node from Jacob’s PR’s branch. (That repo contains runnable versions of the examples in the ESM loaders docs.) Jacob has been working on it and ran into an issue: https://github.com/GeoffreyBooth/node-loaders/pull/2 where a hacky way of determining module type in the example CoffeeScript loader was no longer possible with the merging of the `getFormat` and `load` hooks. We discussed alternatives such as the `resolvePackageRoot` API that’s been under consideration (https://github.com/nodejs/modules/issues/516) but eventually agreed to just implement our own “walk up the file system to find the nearest `package.json` file” logic so as not to be dependent/blocked on other efforts. Jacob will do that and hopefully then his PR can be ready for final code review.

We also discussed moving https://github.com/GeoffreyBooth/node-loaders to an official location like https://github.com/nodejs/loaders-examples. Geoffrey will add some READMEs to that repo and move the non-working loaders into a subfolder like “works-in-progress”, and talk to the nodejs admins about moving the repo into the nodejs org. This would follow the precedent of the https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-examples repo.

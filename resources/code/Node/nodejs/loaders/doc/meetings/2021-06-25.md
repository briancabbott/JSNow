### nodejs/node

* esm: consolidate ESM Loader methods [#37468](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/37468)


## Notes

* We reviewed #37468 together. Just some documentation notes.
* Per-package loaders will come after the current work, as there are likely to be issues to resolve in the design for such a feature.
* @bmeckâ€™s HTTPS imports PR is landing soon, but it will introduce an incompatibility with regard to `import.meta.url` with loaders. Something to sort out before both become unflagged.

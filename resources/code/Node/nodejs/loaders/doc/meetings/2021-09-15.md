## Agenda

### Postponed until next meeting:
* Real life analysis: Yarn’s loader https://github.com/nodejs/loaders/issues/28
* Feature request: Fine grained API to implement loaders that can do what `--experimental-specifier-resolution` does and more https://github.com/nodejs/loaders/issues/26

## Notes

Chaining next steps: update the design doc in loaders repo via PR that loaders team can review and approve; then PR to implement.

Two designs (current and new) could be summarized as: current is like recursion, new is like iterators. Current design has each loader calling the next from within it, like `a(b(c()))`, whereas new design is like `[a, b, c].forEach(fn => fn())`. Both have pros and cons in terms of comprehensibility. We will develop both as markdown files in the loaders repo and evaluate the best versions of each based on each design’s own pros and cons.
